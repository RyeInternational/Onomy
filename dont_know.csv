141,316,"Hi y'all, I couldn't think of a better subreddit to turn to about this than r/adulting so hopefully this is okay, haha;; this is kind of a long post so I'm sorry, it just requires some back story.

So I'm 22, with a boyfriend of 2.5 years, I have recently decided to go back to college to get my AA (and eventually my BA, but I'm going to community college to start), I'm working on getting a job that will work with my school schedule, and...

... I'm the youngest of three siblings so my mom has decided to baby the living hell out of me for years. My boyfriend and I live in the bottom part of her tri level home, rent free. My mom pays for my health insurance, car insurance, and gas, I take care of our phone bill, my credit cards (been working on building my credit the past couple years with no problems), mostly I take care of our food, outings, etc. So while I'm not too worried about eventually taking on the big bills, here's where things get dicey. 

I wouldn't exactly call my mom an alcoholic, but I know whenever she drinks (which happens in phases, she may drop it for a week or two then start again full force) she picks fights with me. The other night it happened again. I went upstairs to show her something cute I bought and somehow it blew up into this massive thing about, somehow, my boyfriend. But the subject is beside the point here, the point is that I'm sick of being afraid of my mother and her drinking. This last time I stood up for myself after being diplomatic didnt work and honestly, I was fully expecting to get slapped or even kicked out. I'm so tired of this endless cycle of her drinking, fighting, then sucking up to the point I'm ready to move out. My siblings have told me to move out since I turned 18 but I've been financially under my moms thumb.

I'm scared for my mental health and well being as well as the security in my place to stay. I have issues with my brainbits that make it hard for me to function sometimes, I know depression and anxiety are a component but in the coming months I'm going to seek treatment and get diagnosed. I've attempted suicide before and while I'm not looking for a way OUT but instead a way out of my parent's (thankfully that's the difference this time versus other times shes pulled stunts like this), I have a bit of another issue with just getting an apartment and moving tf out.

After high school I got a dog to be my unofficial ESA. His name is kodiak and he is the dumbest, sweetest creature on the face of the earth. Hes half rottweiler/half goldendoodle. Hes been an amazing emotional support animal, and once I seek treatment I plan on getting him fully established as my ESA from my therapist. But hes an ""aggressive breed"" which blacklists us from 95% of apartments around us. In addition, my boyfriend has a German shepherd of equally good nature. I've heard you can get two dogs registered as ESAs under one name and it removes the ability to discriminate on breed and weight, and while I have no problem vouching that the pup has helped me (I paid for her anyway, shes my boyfriend's in name only), I just don't know what power landlords can have when it comes to ESAs and the ability to find housing.

My goal is to move out by the end of the year, but my boyfriend thinks we should stay until I've gotten my associates. While I've dealt with my moms possible alcoholism for years, my desire for autonomy is really clashing. While I'm sure I could keep things copacetic enough to be able to stay until then, I really dont want to. I'd rather slowly work on my associates but be free (or face it full force head on while we look for places, then slow down).

Honestly, r/adulting, I just need some advice here.
A) given the backstory, is moving out wise? I cant change my mom, she refuses to believe alcohol has any affect on her and instead it's all my fault, so there's really no changing her behavior. Shes 63 and stubborn as a mule. My siblings have no leverage here either. So it's either move out or suck it up till I graduate, which should I do? 
B) if we decide to move out, what do I do with my dogs? Get both registered as ESAs? Does that even help?
C) call me scum of society if you want, but I fully plan on utilizing food stamps and my college's support systems for poor students if we need it. Are there any other reliable programs to help support us if we need them? I honestly dont know what's out there besides food stamps, if there even IS anything out there besides food stamps lol

Sorry for the long post, but any help is super appreciated.

156,342,"hey. im 19 and i like to have fun. when i dont have fun, i wanna die. how do i stop that?
how do i live my life when i cant enjoy my everyday life? im so unhappy with it and i dont know why. i feel so alone even though im not. im broke now so my friends are having fun and im at home crying. ive never had a job due to mental illness and i dont know how i can move out, or if i even want to",1,1,doing things you have to do
167,370,"So I'm 19 and as much as I don't want to I know I have to start being mature with my money. I'm going to try not to get into the backstory of why I am the way I am, but basically I feel like I had to skip the whole normal teenage years where you work and can spend all your money on normal stuff that you want and not have to worry. So, I think it's hard for me to spend and save wisely because I'm in a position where I feel I can live that way now. Does that make sense? 

I'm 19, still living at home, but work full time. I know that I should move out, but because of what my parents (mostly my dad) did to me growing up I want to milk living here for free as long as possible no matter how toxic the environment. But again, I know I should move out.

 I also realized I should probably figure out what to do about my truck: pay to have it serviced or replace it. Long story short: dad bought the truck 6+ years ago and my older brother used it for a while. Not sure if he did regular maintenance or not. Then it was passed down to me. For the three years I've had it I dont think my dad ever had work done to it. No oil change, nothing. I rarely drove it up until recently because I was doing online school so had no need to leave the house. Then I moved to Seattle for a bit and didn't bring it, but how I drive it every day to and from work. So I'm scared to get it serviced because I know theres probably a shit ton wrong with it and, going back to that ""just wanna spend my money and have fun mentality', I dont want to put money into it. It's a 2004 Toyota Tacoma prerunner with 227,000 miles... feels like it runs great! Hasn't broken down on me ever, but I'm scared that day is fast approaching. So I'm considering trying to buy a used Tacoma with 4wd because it snows here and my little truck now cant handle it. But again, that's a lot of money. 

I want to have fun. For so long I've been burdened by poor mental illness. Secluded from the world, by my own doing, just so I could survive. Dealt with abuse both from others and my own brain. Now, while not free from any of it, I have to have the responsibility of a full time job which makes my mental health worse. My only real escape right now is the expensive hobby of scuba diving. I Was planning on buying my own gear here in a couple days because I'm getting a good bonus on Friday, but now I'm torn between being responsible or treating myself real quick so I can make these next couple months somewhat bearable. 

Savings wise I only have roughly $4k. I have opportunities to make rather large bonuses every month if I work my ass off and am one of the best in the company though. Last month i did just that so I'm getting a bonus this Friday. I dont know how much yet, but some estimate around $2500. It could be more during other months depending on how well we associates do on our goals. Around Christmas time we have what's called super stretch and people have walked  out with $30k bonuses... so theres opportunities to make quite a bit. But I cant operate at full power when every day makes me revert back more and more to suicidal thoughts. With no escape and no motivation it's hard to be your best. Hence my desire to spend money in the pursuit of happiness.

443,759,Im 26 yo m. Ok so I guess I'll start with the landlord shes selling it to me for 43k (2 bedroom 1 bathroom big attic big basement) (it goes for 70 something k but this is kind  of a special case. Her son who owns it is in prison and she doesn't want it) I make roughly 38k a year at my job I've worked at for over 2 years. The garage has to be torn down its dilapidated. The attic needs insulation. All windows should be replaced they are very old and fragile and leak air. The kitchen should be remodeled (it's not unlivable but it's old and tacky and no dish washer) bathroom same deal. And basement has small leak by floor also not a huge deal(I dont think?) But other than that I've lived here 2 years already and have noticed no other problems the roof is brand new. She installed brand new furnace(3k) and new front steps (1k) I'm not particularly handy but I'm going to try and demo the garage myself with a friend but everything else I'll probably hire someone to do it for me. And more info about me I have 4k in savings but I've built my credit up to 730-740 within 12 months. My car is worth 5.5k and fully paid off and very reliable.

545,898,"I think about this a lot.

I’m going to a pretty prestigious college, where I’ll likely get a degree that will allow me to work a stable job and make good money in the city. Maybe it’ll be a job that requires me to travel a lot, that would be interesting— or simply staying in the city. And I like the city— I like the immediacy of everything, the ease of transport, the entertainment, variety, and constant contact of people, even if theyre not close friends.

However.

Just as much as I’m interested in the city, I love the idea of having my own home with a garden that provides me food, chickens to care for, and maybe even a more intense farm animal-caring lifestyle where I care for and practice horseback riding.

I’m not unfamiliar with both of these. My grandparents on one side are a farmers and I’ve practiced horseback, I enjoy it a lot and I love having food that I raised in the conditions I choose. But my family on the other side is very much full of city people, so Im totally comfortable and happy there as well!

I dont know how I’m even supposed to divide these two. I feel like if I pick one I’ll be unfulfilled because I rejected the other. Caring for farm animals is something that takes a lot of time, but I dont know if I would want to give up a life full of opportunities from the city to be on a farm, and vice versa...

600,1016,"So I have an older brother who will never stop gaming. Hes 21 now, and he doesnt really help my mom pay any sort of bills, or consistently helps around the house.

This makes my mom mad. Really mad. But because she somehow still has a use for him, and values family too much, shes never going to kick him out. This results in him going several months without paying any sort of rent, while my mom complains and cries about why he wont help out.

I seriously dont know whats up with him. Could he be depressed? He wanted to study engineering but got kicked out of college. Ever since then hes been staying at home playing videos games most of the time locked up in his room. 

I used to suggest jobs or things he could do but he always found a way to shoot it down. The very few times he has worked he decided to quit not long after. 

I just want to help imrpove the situation, becuase if my mom gets mad at him she gets pissed at everyone else. She makes a lot of threats though (taking away his ps4, tv, computer etc.) but never really does anything until shes at a peak (which she rarely ever reaches) 

Is there any kind of program for this situation to help him? Ive told him maybe he just needs some sort of therapy but he doesnt like the idea. Anything that can convince him to can help! He'd be willing to listen to logical arguments that suit him, I just havent found one for him yet.

840,1468,"The details; I'm 21. I work from home as a office manager/bookkeeper for a small company. My someday plan, thats been taking over my headspace, is to shift from as employee who does bookkeeping, to a small business who bookkeeps for small businesses or people's personal finance. I will stay with the company I'm with, but will slowly start taking on new customers. But quite frankly I dont know what the first step in that transition should be.

This planning of mine has sparked a million other thoughts and questions. I bring in the majority of money between my long term boyfriend and I - he is building his streaming channel. Our living situation makes it easy to live on my income, but we aren't saving much - even thought we do have a little emergency fund of $6000 at this point.

But. Being 21 and 23 im starting to think about how I should be planning on aquiring a house. I dont know what my first step should be there. We plan to adopt and that gets quite costly - I dont even know how to breach into that. Since we live simply we want to save heavy and invest so we can retire early-ish. But I have absolutely no idea how to invest or make our money work for us. We have zero debt. But we also have zero credit. So I know that needs to change.

1353,2200,"So Ive been experiencing some quarter life crisis during the pandemic, perhaps due to the fact that Im home a lot following quarantine. 

Aside from the fact that corporate work is political and stressful.
Im working in HR by the way, handling a lot of different processes for expatriates.(benefits, payroll related and the like)
Our workload just blew up since March of this year and it has been very complicated and stressful. I understand where the frustration of these employees come from, however when you receive non stop escalations and frustrations everyday it becomes draining. I also dont like working at home as it kind of removes the feeling of comfort at home. However given the current pandemic..this is inevitable. I dread going to work every morming and I just kind of do it on auto mode nowadays like a robot. 

Before this role, Ive been working in HR as  a recruiter and onboarding, both of which are also stressful in my previous companies. Thinking about it now, I appreciate the field of HR as it is mostly looked down upon a lot..but I guess I also came to realize what I hate about the work and what I know Im good at so far.
Its tiring, and makes me lose hope on humanity to be honest (a lot of jerks out there..not all..just some)

My current company is also undergoing change and streamlining ...meaning they will remove people..and im anxious because I know I need to save up as looking for a job is hard in this pandemic...but mostly I know Id feel more relieved if they cut me off. Less Stressors and more time to figure out what I really want.
I dont know if its too selfish to think this way, as I know my family would be disappointed with me. Afterall, its a big company im working for and a lot of people would want to be hired in it as well..but the fact remains I really dont like what I do.

Internally transferring positions is currently not possible as they are cutting down people as we speak...and more will be cut by end of the year.

Im just doing my best currently holding on...saving up as much as I can..riding the wave out..anxious if Im about to lose my job but also want to take a break. I keep thinking everyday, whats the point of pushing and working hard to get recognized..if we will be cut off anyway..it feels as though they already have a decision and just letting us work our asses off until the end of the year. No recognitions as well and anh performance appraisals..

I'm done trying to find this paperwork, I've called so many people and companies and made zero progress. I'm at a point to where I'm willing to seriously struggle if I have to in order to get a lawyer. My problem is, I have no idea how to do that? I dont know what kind of lawyer I need much less how to track one down. Anybody have any advice? I dont even know what kind of action the Lawyer can help me with. Will they be able to get the court to award me the car or something? Even pointing me in a direction where I can start my research would be infinitely helpful I have no starting point.

As the title says, im 26F with 2 kids, 9 and 8 months. I made it through high-school and graduated (a year late for what should be a pretty obvious reason) I tried going to college right after but hated it, never went to classes, never studied and dropped out. I went through a program a few months after I turned 21 to drive a semi truck and loved it. Drove over the road, did local and eventually settled into end dump and thats what i did til I was 20 weeks pregnant with my 8 month old. And now I'm a stay at home mom while my SO is an over the road cattle hauler. I think im ready to go back to school but im not really sure where to start. The program im looking into is at a community college close by. An Associates in applied science for equine science. Now, I dont know a ton about horses beyond what my daughter has learned at her weekly horse lessons but growing up I wanted to be a vet for horses and other farm animals. Obviously I probably can't be a vet (I was told I was too dumb when I was growing up) but I think this would be the closest I could get to it. I was having a pretty emotional response while looking into it. First it was because it was overwhelming, then because I had no idea how to apply or if I should do a FASFA, how to talk to an advisor, then it was because how in the world could I do this as practically a single parent with no nearby support system (SO is gone for about a month at a time and my nearest family is 2.5 hours away). Is it worth it to keep looking into, where do I start. I had an email sent to me saying I need to take a placement test and all that but I dont know. I feel like im over thinking it l, maybe I cant do it, maybe this is dumb, etc. I just don't know where to start. Classes start August 17th, is it too late for this coming semester? I'm in the Midwest, US if that makes a difference

Please forgive me if this doesn't make any sense, im so overwhelmed and I feel all jumbled. 

I havent talked to my mom about it yet, she suggested looking into college again but I doubt this is the kind of thing she was thinking.

Im 21 and i feel like im at the point of my quarter life crisis where i regret not preparing more for this adulting phase. I suddenly feel like I have so much on my plate and im fairly new to prioritising these big things. I do not know if what im doing is right because none of my decisions has had any visible harsh consequences so i cant use that as a gauge on what im doing.

I've recently grad (studied far from home) and have moved back to my parents place. Im looking to work full time back in the city and my lease (apartment in the city) is still going. I used to live with my boyfriend but we are now taking a break and im not sure if im ready to live alone. My parents has asked me to live at home and find a job nearby (not many opportunities w career progression). But living away from home as opened up an entire new thing on me doing things that work for me and building my own routine.

I'm torn apart because moving to the city means I am to live alone and find a good job while pushing myself out of my comfort zones, where as finding a job near home means I could live w my parents and keep my dog. I dont know which to prioritise when finding a job, comfort or opportunities, and im very sure there are other factors that would contribute.

I would like some advice on how should I make this decision. Should I put ""taking risk"" into my suitcase and jump onto the train, or should I hold back until i feel more ready? I feel like no one is ever ready for adulting and im not sure if im being a chicken about it.",2,1,Packing my suitcase to board the adulting train but what do I fit in my bag?
2888,4411,"So I work in ""retail"" a much fancier word for grocery I guess. We have to literally hunt for our shifts due to the job being so flexible. They company I work for keeps masshiring people (qualifications or some to none) and it's getting very hard to obtain shifts. Usually what I would do a week is grab three doubles and this week I only managed one so far. The server they get dropped onto always runs extremely slow and all 50 or less shifts for 500 or more or less people ALWAYS run out in less than 1 to 2 minutes.
I've been applying to other retail related jobs and I only have gotten one call back but the second interview was never fully completed due to miscommunication.
I have a BA degree and my prospective job field doesn't seem like they're going to hire anyone with no experience aside from the current retail experience and the countless volunteering experience I've done(still not employment though). 
My anxiety cranks up everyday before, during and after shifts drops and it leaves me with a feeling of hopelessness. I moved in with my partner and I help pay rent too aside from car payments, loans, and credit car debt. I'm disappointed I guess. Maybe in myself but also that I didn't jump into the field I wanted before covid hit. It's really mess this up for me and many others.

And my mom has always taught me to “be the best” “put in 110%” and my sister is an ivy league student and I’m kind of a loser, idk what happened to me. My dad doesn’t really care much, he’s never disciplined me he’s lazy himself (the main reason why my parents’ marriage has been failing but they stay together for the kids) maybe i took after him? Idk. 

But now I’m in a place in my life where I want to stop feeling like a loser and want to be more proactive and challenge myself and push myself to be the best I can be.

I’ve always been a daring, adventurous person. There will always be a part of me that longs for the fast life I think. I used to smoke a lot of weed, blackout whenever I drank on weekends (which wasn’t every weekend because I was never much of a drinker mostly because I dont like the taste), but the smoking was excessive. And I liked the bad boys. I used to be involved with a drug dealer and we would smoke together sometimes. But now I have a boyfriend who is put together, very smart, and even has never gotten high in his life. I don’t drink often anymore, I don’t enjoy going out (but i never really did unless im in the right setting like a cool nyc club or rooftop bar or something. Not a fan of college parties), and I havent smoked in more than a year (mostly because it makes me depressed about my path of life and made me reevaluate myself and told me that i have to stop smoking because i dont know the first thing of balance. If i smoke a lot, i allow it to make me lazy and allow it to affect my motivation, therefore I stopped it all together.
In addition, I see myself forcing to be around people who want to strive to be better and be successful but I feel out of place and intimidated most of the time when I’m with them as opposed to my close friends who aren’t super motivated, maybe a little mediocre idk. 

But I miss all of this. I miss not worrying about school, I miss smoking often, I miss being involved with the bad boy, I miss just being around “mediocre” friends. I guess I miss being stupid and immature....how do I stop missing this? I shouldn’t be missing this? 

I get bored. I like the adrenaline, i miss the adrenaline. I feel alive.

I have some repairs I need to get done. Specifically, I need to get a new bathtube and tile. i dont have time to learn how to do it myself so I wanted to hire some people. 

It seems like a plumber likely wouldnt do something like this. Another option is to informally hire a ""handy man."" I read I should hire a contractor but I dont know what that is. Is a contractor a construction company? Would they do something as small as replacing my shower? Or is a contractor a fancy name for a handy man?

5447,7917,"TL;DR at bottom


I don't know if I just need to vent or need advice or what, but I am going crazy. 


So I (22F) moved out in March after I got married. My husband and I bought a house in a small rural town about 15 minutes from my parents. It was nice at first. We did a lot of renovations, painting etc, and it was fun and excited. We kinda stopped after we both started working longer hours and only have about every other weekend together. Our walls still need painted, porch needs fixed, linoleum needs replacing, etc. It's still livable but not super homey. 


A few months after living here, someone moved into the empty house next door. Didn't have an issue with them, or anybody, as we are friendly, but try to keep to ourselves. Turns out, that guy was already living there, but he just got out of jail/prison and was back home. He's friendly to us when we see him, but he's always walking around the neighborhood, shirtless, and sometimes holding a baseball bat. I've seen him yell at the guy across the street. I'm pretty sure he and his gf/wife are always high on something, not to mention their loud arguments. Their electricity doesn't work. It's all just a little sketchy. 


We noticed a few small things get stolen off the porch, like water bottles, over the course of a few days, then our gas can on the porch was taken. And then the one in the shed was taken. We made a police report, but they just told us we should put up cameras if we can. A few nights later I was home and my dog just starts barking like crazy at the front and side door. I am paranoid already, but I go outside and don't see anything. Well the next day as my husband is leaving for work, he notices some dirt smeared by our front door. Like someone had brushed up against the house. My husband got to thinking and stood on the door jamb, holding the frame, looking in the little arch window on the front door. Sure enough, same place where the dirt was. 


So I got that contact paper stuff that still lets light in, but you can't see in or out. We've also gotten a couple cameras, door and window alarms, and those poles you wedge under the doorknob to prevent someone from opening the door. I AM STILL TERRIFIED. I have probably listened to way too many true crime podcasts, maybe watched too much Dateline and First 48, but I am still not comfortable in my own home. 


On top of all that, I am so incredibly lonely. My husband and I work opposite shifts. So I work in the morning, come home, see home for maybe half an hour, then he leaves, comes home while I'm sleeping, and if he's able, he'll stay up and see me while I get ready to to to work. Most nights he's too tired to stay up, so I only see him after I get off. That's if I don't work over. He gets weekends off, but my schedule varies, and I'm working at least 2 weekends a month. Whenever he leaves, I just get so sad because I'm home alone (in a house I'm scared to be in anyway) and I start really missing living with my parents. I am really close to them and my brother, so I'll be thinking about them and text them when I'm feeling really lonely, and they are not great at getting back to me. Or the conversation is super dry. Mostly cause they just aren't big on that. But in person, it's a lot better. I go over there a lot to ease the loneliness, but I feel like a burden sometimes cause I don't live there anymore and I have my own house. 


My 2 best friends live 5 hours away from me, out of state. I've lived here for 3 years and made a few friends a work. Nobody I can really connect with though. I try to clean and pursue school and my hobbies, but most nights I get so sad that I just lay in bed on my phone, hoping I'll fall asleep soon so I don't have to feel this way. 


Moving is on the table, but not possible for a while. We're getting ready to put up more security cameras as well. I really tired of being here and think my mental health has really taken a toll. Some nights I'll just sit and cry by myself because I'm so sad or scared. I dont know what to do. My husband says nothing will change if I don't change it. I do agree, but I can only do so much. I don't wanna be the kinda person to feel sorry for myself either. So I don't know what to do or how to feel. If someone has some feedback or advice or even critisism on this whole situation, please let me know. I'm just sick of it all.

5844,8461,"So my mom has a joint savings/checking account with me that was opened when I was like 15-16. Right now it has around $8k in there from my refund checks that I get from college after paying tuiton. That's money I'm kinda ""not allowed"" to touch without permission, and my mom sees the money as ""her money that she's allowing me access"" to, since the refunds came from loans that use her income. 

I'm planning to move out 2023 when I graduate college and looking into opening my own bank account now to have independence of my own money and be able to just up and move out without their interference .

At the moment I have no job or type of income and I most likely would have issues transferring the $8k to a new bank acct, bc my mom would raise hell about it. I have around $100 saved up that I can deposit atm. 
This bank account would be soley used for saving and not spending. I also have a second address to send any mail from the bank too thanks to my boyfriend. 

(I'm currently looking into finding a way to get a job to put the money in, but I dont know how that'd go since my parents would expect me to put that income into the joint account)

As the title says, I do NOT want my parents to catch wind of this bank account. Ever. 

They'd see it as me defying them or being sneaky and wouldnt like the fact that they'd have no control over the money I put in there. They would most likely force me to hand over the information/money or question me about why I have it and I dont want that to happen. 

So how do I go about this? What should I look out for? What can I do to ensure that they don't find out?",13,18,I'm 20 and looking to open my own bank account without my parents knowing.
5888,8528,"I am a recruiter at a small boutique firm. This is my first job out of college and I am currently 23. Its a very small firm under 10 people. There is little room for growth because of how small it is and the structure. The thing is, even if I did get promoted, I don't think I would enjoy the job anymore. I'm quite good at it and all my internal evaluative meetings have been pretty good with them emphasizing how much they love me but I just don't like recruiting. 
Recruiting in nature is a sales job, you're selling a job to candidates and selling candidates to a client. This requires you to be an extrovert or at least enjoy talking to people. I am really good at faking extrovertism but I hate talking to people. Or at least the way we do it. It all seems fake and forced and our firm just seems so picky and wastes people time. But on the other side of the coin, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING WITH MY LIFE. I know now is not the time to make a move with the pandemic going on and I realize how lucky I am to have a job right now. I am so aware of that. But once this is all over (hopefully sooner rather than later), I want to explore opportunities. I just dont know what im good at.

6107,8838,"About 2 years ago I had friend whose life was just going to shit. I live in a different part of the country, and suggested she come out here to make a fresh start in a place where no one knows her and her life drama won't follow. I told her she could live with my brother, myself, and our other roommate for a few month for free until she gets going on her own. This woman double majored in English and Philosophy, so it ended up blowing my mind that so many simple things were difficult for her to grasp, like when she was trying to convince my brother that 'profit is morally dubious' (yes she is one of those people) but she didn't understand the difference between life insurance and 401k retirement plans. (Yes, seriously)

She was also OBSESSED with England. She spent a summer there as part of a work study program and loved it, which I totally get. I love Ireland and travel there frequently, even met my wife there. 

While staying with us she managed to save up and take a trip to England. After returning she tells me she is confused about something related to her travel. She initially said that the flight to England seemed to go faster than expected, and the flight back seem to take way longer. I said this understandable, you're excited when you are going and sad to be leaving. Then she said she couldn't understand why it took 16 hours to fly direct from Denver to London, but only 2.5 hours to fly from London to Denver.

""Really...you dont know?"" I might have thought she was messing with me, but truthfully this level of discussion was normal.

So I explained that she crossed 7 time zones, her flight was only 9 or 9.5 hours (I've done the exact flight many times) but you have to add the time zones to that figure, and when you are coming back you subtract them. It's not an exact equation, but it usually gets you in the ball park, like within an hour and a half or so.

I even gave a basic example, if you leave Denver on a 9 hour flight to London at 6 AM (Denver time), crossing 7 time zones, you should land around 10 PM in London. If you are going from London to Denver on a 9 hour flight, leaving at 6 AM (London time) you should arrive around 8 AM Denver time.

I explained all this and she just stared at me, I might as well have been speaking Chinese, she finally just said ""I'm overloaded by this, you just blew my mind""

By the way, she wants to be a college professor.",4,1,Educated adult struggles with simple concepts
