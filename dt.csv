103,I'm a 29-year-old woman who's trying to get an apartment for the first time. I have no idea what I'm doing.,"I have no credit to speak of. I have little renter's history. I do have a willing cosigner (my dad).

I'm currently married, but will be divorcing in a month or two. My STBX is retiring from the military and we currently live on a military base. I am trying to move by 1 July.

I cannot drive due to visual impairment and therefore rely solely on public transportation to get to and from work. It's about 2.5 hours each way. I wish to minimize my commute so have been looking at places around where I work, where the cost of living is high. I found some apartments I think I can afford and are a five-minute bus ride to/from work.

I have been talking with the leasing manager at these places and she told me that to qualify my monthly income needs to be four times that of the cost of rent. Well, I don't make that yet. Does that mean I need to look elsewhere? I work an 8-5.

I know that I'll need money for first+last month's rent, deposit, application fee, pet fee, etc. I also asked about the cost of utilities and will get renter's insurance.

So, I guess my question is, am I doing this right? What am I missing? I feel so ridiculous that I don't know how to do any of this stuff. Thank you all in advance for any help."
146,The Basics of Applying for Medical Insurance?,"I don't know why it seems overwhelmingly confusing, but I have no idea how to apply for insurance. I don't understand the bronze/silver/gold system, and im not sure how payments work or if I have to apply in person or can do it over the phone or online. I do need specific care (especially orthopedic, endocrine, and mental care) but unsure how to look those up too when choosing plans. Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"
153,Turing 18 in a few days and I don't think I'm ready,"I'm soon to be an adult but I don't feel like I'm ready. I'm not very independent or as independent as I'd like to be and the whole thought of becoming independent really freaks me out. I honestly don't know why I'm posting this lol, maybe just to say it to someone. "

238,I unclogged my bathroom drain with a pair of scissors.,I still don't know why it worked. I'm young and was too embarassed to call someone to do it and I don't own the proper tools to do it myself.
240,Do people get flakier with social plans as they get older?,I think something about life not being as predictable in the adult world as it used to be can affect your social life.  It's harder to make plans when you don't know what you'll be doing next and when it will be okay to use your phone for long periods of time.
252,Bedframe question.,"I have a split box spring, and they meet on a joint for my bedframe and I'm not sure if this is dangerous. 

The joint is held by a nut and bolt and I don't know if tightening it will straighten things out.

It is slightly uncomfortable but nothing too bad, I just don't want to get hurt or hurt my cat or the box spring.

Any advice would be appreciated"
276,When I realize I've reached the bridge to cross over to being an adult... and I don't know how to feel.,"So I'm graduating in May, and it's becoming more real that I need to make some decisions that are ultimately going to really shake things up in my life... for the most part in great ways. I've been dating a wonderful guy for 4 years. I will have my degree and will be on my way to getting a job in a profession I am passionate about. I don't know if I am looking for advice or if I just need to let it all out. Well, my boyfriend got a job offer in another state.. we both agreed that we didn't want to live together before getting married. So he should be starting this summer. I'm left with feelings of excitement and wanting to start this new adventure with him. The area he would be moving to has great job opportunities for me as well. What's holding me back is the bittersweetness of telling my parents (btw I'm an only child) that I plan on moving out of state and that I also plan on getting married. 

I  am not engaged yet, but I know my boyfriend and I are not interested in maintaining a long distance relationship much longer after graduation. I'm nervous to express these possible plans to my parents, but I'm also giving mixed signals to my boyfriend as well because I can't seem to definitely say yes to these plans. I want to do it, but I'm thinking of my family. Most of my family has expressed how they want me to enjoy life and have told me that they didn't really want me to get married right after college. However, they all said they would support me as long as I was doing things that I truly wanted. There's a huge part of me that wants to start this life with my boyfriend, and I really mean that, but I also realize that there comes goodbyes and major changes in my life that I can't believe I have made it to. I want the adulting life, but why does it come with so many emotions? I just don't want to disappoint anyone and I know that I tend to overthink and care too much and cater to others. I guess the biggest question in my head is do I take this leap of faith, or do I do the safe thing and wait it out? "
280,How to break a lease? Consequences?,"Hi, I made a post here before about my situation so this is kind of an update &amp; some questions.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Adulting/comments/adeqa5/18f_no_job_feel_like_im_going_crazy

My ""apartment"" is a studio with no kitchen in a building that is legally a motel but does not rent rooms for short stays. I have a lease that is titled ""At Will Room Agreement"" and it states that I must stay for an initial period of 6 months and then it is month-to-month from there. The 6 months will be over on June 1. Rent is $725 and I can't really afford that even with a job (currently no job)

I got an offer from a good friend to move in as his roommate in march, because his roommate is leaving by march 1. I would be paying only $475 a month there! I have spent a lot of time at his place and I think it would be a much better fit. I'd have my own room, there is a kitchen with a dishwasher, the walls are much more soundproof, and I know some of the other people on his floor. I feel comfortable there, whereas here I am very afraid of my neighbors to the point it is terrifying to walk from my door to my car.

I need to break my lease here. But I don't know what the consequences of that would be. I did not pay a deposit, only first and last months rent. Currently my plan is to pay February's rent before February 1 and include a signed note saying I cannot afford to continue living here and march will be my last month and I will return my keys as soon as I have vacated the unit (before the end of march). If I do this can they evict me? I worry they would claim I didn't pay the rent. Should I use a certified check to pay the rent for February? Can they charge me a fine even though I did not have a deposit?

If these questions would be better answered in a different subreddit let me know! Thank you! I appreciate the support I got from my previous post and I'm sorry I didn't reply to the comments. Anxietyyyyyyy is fun"
292,How does one find a job?,"Hi everyone!

&amp;#x200B;

I (25F) don't feel like an adult at all, but I'm willing to try starting adulting. I'm finishing a grade in social anthropology and overcoming a deep long-lasting depression. I'm almost done being a student (at least for now) and I wish to start adulting haha. 

I have a very close friend that has been living alone for a year and wish to move to an apartment were we could live together for a low price. She needs to move in April and I feel like this is really a great opportunity. I am excited about the idea of living with her, because we get each other in a deep emotional but also having fun and still begin responsible level, and we motivate each other a lot. I'm also excited because I want to stop living at my family's house; I love them and all, but I feel like it's time to 'get out of the nest and explore the world'. To be an independent autonomous human being and try to live my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, all of that is awesome, but of course it doesn't work if I don't have a job that can pay the rent, right. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I've never looked for a job before. I have worked as a waitress for very short periods, and my last job (about a year ago) was a mid'time office job in a cinematographic university where I was... like...general assistant and a bit community manager. But I got there because it was new and my uncle was creating and directing it and he needed help and I was available and that. So I didn't actually found the job, right? 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know hoe to look for a job. 

And I'm not being picky. I think I can do pretty much whatever it needs at least for now. I could be waitress again or something for instance. But I don't even know what the options are. Of course I would prefer a good job, interesting and stimulating, but I don't know where to look, how to look. I feel very childish and spoiled but I have no idea how to do this and it's starting to really overwhelm me.

I'm quite smart, I can be sociable (even if inside I die from anxiety but outside I look quite extroverted and nice), I write pretty good... And I'm willing to learn and to test stuff. I don't know what I want to do 'in life' but I'm willing to, instead of stressing out because of that, try out things and see what fits me. Also, I will probably not have my degree by April but I would have finished my classes (would just need my thesis), so yeah, I'm looking for full-time stuff but that doesn't need a degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm excited and want to do this, and also super afraid (I'm afraid of adulting, I'm afraid of my depression, I'm afraid that I don't know HOW to be a autonomous person). I have no idea what can one do for a living... It sounds stupid but... yeah. I have no idea WHERE I can even look for a job. Where could a send resumes. How do you do a resume. If you just look in 'findingjobs dot com' until you find something, or if you go to the enterprises and leave your resume. What kind of enterprises. Do they need people like me. How do I know that. Etc... 

&amp;#x200B;

Please... I need some wisdom, some advises, some steps or to-do-list, some perspective on what kind of jobs I could be looking for, where, how to find them, how to discover who needs people working, how to get those jobs... etc...

299,How to invest money?,"Hi, I'm currently working full time, trying to save up to probably go back to college in a few years. So far I have about 5000CAD. As I'm not going to use my money right now, I'm looking for a way to fructify it. I'm not sure if I should make an investment account at my bank. On their website, the estimation I would make in a year is a little less than 300CAD. The other option that I know of would be to invest in stock. I don't know much about economics though, so I'm not sure if it's a good option. I'm not sure if there is any other option than those two.

Thanks so much for any advice."

306,Moving out,"I'm 19 years old. I'm trying to move out of my parents house and into low income apartments down the street. My problem is, I have no clue where to start. I just got a job recently ($9.50 an hour) but I haven't started yet because I still have to schedule orientation and actually start working ( I'm giving them my papers from my physical and everything else they asked for tomorrow, so hopefully my orientation should be soon.) Right now I'm completely at a loss for how to start out on my own. I'm currently attempting to apply for cash, food, and medical assistance, but since my income and residency will change sometime soon, I'm unsure if I should wait until I move to apply, or go ahead and apply with my current information. I owe student loans (I'm not sure how much because I dropped out at the beginning of second semester as a freshman) and $200 in a doctors bill. I don't drive (I have horrible anxiety and I haven't learned yet) so I'm basically on my parents schedule because they are my transportation. I'm very stressed out because I'm worrying about paying the money I owe and moving out on my own. I don't know if I should just wait to start my job before worrying about all this, or if there is something I can do about all of this right now. Once I do start my job, I don't know if I should pay back my loans first or move out first, and when I should apply for the assistance. My parents are doing their best to help, but they have busy lives and there is only so much they can do for me. I'm at a loss for how to do this and what to do next "
316,22 y/o facing issues with finding housing,"Hi y'all, I couldn't think of a better subreddit to turn to about this than r/adulting so hopefully this is okay, haha;; this is kind of a long post so I'm sorry, it just requires some back story.

So I'm 22, with a boyfriend of 2.5 years, I have recently decided to go back to college to get my AA (and eventually my BA, but I'm going to community college to start), I'm working on getting a job that will work with my school schedule, and...

... I'm the youngest of three siblings so my mom has decided to baby the living hell out of me for years. My boyfriend and I live in the bottom part of her tri level home, rent free. My mom pays for my health insurance, car insurance, and gas, I take care of our phone bill, my credit cards (been working on building my credit the past couple years with no problems), mostly I take care of our food, outings, etc. So while I'm not too worried about eventually taking on the big bills, here's where things get dicey. 

I wouldn't exactly call my mom an alcoholic, but I know whenever she drinks (which happens in phases, she may drop it for a week or two then start again full force) she picks fights with me. The other night it happened again. I went upstairs to show her something cute I bought and somehow it blew up into this massive thing about, somehow, my boyfriend. But the subject is beside the point here, the point is that I'm sick of being afraid of my mother and her drinking. This last time I stood up for myself after being diplomatic didnt work and honestly, I was fully expecting to get slapped or even kicked out. I'm so tired of this endless cycle of her drinking, fighting, then sucking up to the point I'm ready to move out. My siblings have told me to move out since I turned 18 but I've been financially under my moms thumb.

I'm scared for my mental health and well being as well as the security in my place to stay. I have issues with my brainbits that make it hard for me to function sometimes, I know depression and anxiety are a component but in the coming months I'm going to seek treatment and get diagnosed. I've attempted suicide before and while I'm not looking for a way OUT but instead a way out of my parent's (thankfully that's the difference this time versus other times shes pulled stunts like this), I have a bit of another issue with just getting an apartment and moving tf out.

After high school I got a dog to be my unofficial ESA. His name is kodiak and he is the dumbest, sweetest creature on the face of the earth. Hes half rottweiler/half goldendoodle. Hes been an amazing emotional support animal, and once I seek treatment I plan on getting him fully established as my ESA from my therapist. But hes an ""aggressive breed"" which blacklists us from 95% of apartments around us. In addition, my boyfriend has a German shepherd of equally good nature. I've heard you can get two dogs registered as ESAs under one name and it removes the ability to discriminate on breed and weight, and while I have no problem vouching that the pup has helped me (I paid for her anyway, shes my boyfriend's in name only), I just don't know what power landlords can have when it comes to ESAs and the ability to find housing.

My goal is to move out by the end of the year, but my boyfriend thinks we should stay until I've gotten my associates. While I've dealt with my moms possible alcoholism for years, my desire for autonomy is really clashing. While I'm sure I could keep things copacetic enough to be able to stay until then, I really dont want to. I'd rather slowly work on my associates but be free (or face it full force head on while we look for places, then slow down).

Honestly, r/adulting, I just need some advice here.
A) given the backstory, is moving out wise? I cant change my mom, she refuses to believe alcohol has any affect on her and instead it's all my fault, so there's really no changing her behavior. Shes 63 and stubborn as a mule. My siblings have no leverage here either. So it's either move out or suck it up till I graduate, which should I do? 
B) if we decide to move out, what do I do with my dogs? Get both registered as ESAs? Does that even help?
C) call me scum of society if you want, but I fully plan on utilizing food stamps and my college's support systems for poor students if we need it. Are there any other reliable programs to help support us if we need them? I honestly dont know what's out there besides food stamps, if there even IS anything out there besides food stamps lol

Sorry for the long post, but any help is super appreciated.

322,Busy most days not every day but don't want to visit parents - advice?,"So I have been realizing more and more that I really haven't been visiting my parents barely at all anymore. I live 45 minutes away in a college town - one year left on my CS degree. Last time I visited was honestly I think early January. I feel really bad for this because I like my mom. I'm not a fan of my dad much at all, he is very intense sometimes and it's hard to know just when he's going to lose it. Even if I come home he doesn't seem to consider that anyways, he will still possibly be shouting at my mom. I also right now work 35 to 40 hours a week. I still have 2 days off in a row for once this week which makes it much easier to go home and come back the next morning. (I dont even have my own car so its just even more of a bother to get someone else to drive me.) But I really don't want to visit because I really just enjoy spending the time off with my boyfriend plus he works nights so I barely get to see him as much lately. I feel so selfish because I still obviously see my boyfriend way way more than my parents. (I live with my boyfriend anyways). And I don't want to ask to take off days from work to go home since I really could use the money. I don't know if I made this overly lengthy but thank you guys for any sort of advice. Clearly it's up to me to go home or not but it's just confusing to me if I should feel so bad about it like I do..."
384,sheltered kid needs advice on adulting in general,"i wasn't sure where to ask this or how without coming across as immature, but: i've been mollycoddled my whole life (exempt from chores, had everything scheduled for me, etc), and now that i'm 19 my parents want me to take up more housework and take care of my personal things. any advice on how to get better at this? i always seem to forget important things despite how basic they are, like vacuuming or ironing my clothes in favor of indulgent hobbies (gaming, etc.). i'm sick of being called and treated like a child and having an increasingly strained relationship with my parents but i don't know how to change overnight. Sorry if this is a stupid question, but i have no one else to ask and i would like to know where to start learning how to take care of myself and my parents. "
386,Got to a new adulting level recently,Figuring out that roommates are not worth the hassle. Esp if they don't know how to adult themselves. 
408,Quitting my job soon,"I've put in several applicationns so far, haven't heard back from any of them. My boss has become increasingly rude and demanding and inappropriate over the past year or so. The whole building is an OSHA violation(we haven't had proper ventilation in the whole two years I worked there) and she treats me like her personal slave. I don't trust myself to work there another week. 
I want to be professional about it, but I'm a General Contractor. I can leave any time I want and not give a notice. They're already looking for a new employee to replace someone else, so I don't feel bad for not giving a notice. 
I guess I just feel sick to my stomach about going in in the morning and telling them that I'm not coming back. The owner is a good guy, but the manager (his girlfriend) is impossible to be around. Other than her, though, I love everything else about the job. Great hours, great coworkers, and I get to make shit. She's just spoiled all of it. I know I'll regret it if I stay and I know I'll regret it if I leave. I just don't know what to do. Maybe I'm just getting cold feet. 
I guess I just need advice. I know how I'm going to tell the owner that I'm leaving. I just need that last boost, you know? I'm living at home still, and have several thousand dollars saved so money isn't that big of an issue. I just need someone to kick me in the ass and tell me to leave. "

I bought a shredder but I don't know which ones I can shred and how far back should I save?"
484,"As soon as you turned 18, did you already understand everything about taxes, saving money, car payments, jobs, college, financial aid, etc.?","- I can't help but feel like a total dumb ass and that I'm behind on my shit. I'm 20 and finally started college, after taking two years off. I needed a breather and went through some health issues. My parents aren't that great with English, and they usually need my older sister's help with understanding things -- so they didn't teach me a lot, which I totally get. It's what it is. I knew growing up... I needed to figure things out on my own and try to be as independent as I could be.


- I felt like such a dunce when I was trying to fill out my financial aid. I'm the first person in my family to go to college. I was mostly scared of fucking it up immensely for myself (got a big fear of messing up, it's a deep-rooted thing and blah blah blah, don't want to get into it, lol). I easily get anxious over these things, especially when it comes to money and reading important documents, trying to understand health insurance, plans to buy a car -- adult stuff. I also don't want to look stupid. Hah.


- When I was younger I was used to helping others out and being the one people go to for help/advice, so I can't help but feel inadequate and slow when I tend to ask others for help on these things that I feel like I should know already. Am I being honest with myself here, or is it a very normal thing? To feel this way? I still live with my parents, because -- again, health reasons -- and I feel bad for asking my parents about certain things. They just don't know how to explain things in the right words. They do try to help to a certain extent, but they usually would just do it for me instead of explaining, which is **not** what I want. I'm grateful for it, don't get me wrong, but how am I supposed to learn if I don't do these things myself?


- I started college very recently, and students who are two years younger than me, fresh out of high school are talking about things that I don't understand. I just feel really behind.


- So, referring to the title again: *As soon as you turned 18, did you already understand everything about taxes, saving money, car payments, jobs, college, financial aid, etc.?*


- Also, what were your experiences like when you started figuring out the adult world? Lots of embarrassing moments? Mistakes you've made and learned from? Things you wish you could tell yourself if you could turn back time to when you were 18 (or whatever age you decided to be ~fully~ independent)?

*Thank you.*

485,Kinda lost and need advice.,"Hi, I'm new to this and I've only been lurking for a long time. I'm not sure if this is going in the right subreddit but here goes. 

I am 22 this year, have a degree in architecture, currently studying masters in architecture and just finished my first semester in it. Personally, I don't really like architecture but my parents were in a rush to send me off to college which made me rushed my studying options as architecture was one of choices my parents would approve of coming from an Asian family, and I didn't like the idea of pursuing engineering at that point of time. After 3 years I've finished my bachelors and now I've completed first semester in masters of architecture and another 2 years to go. I've failed 2 out of 4 units this semester, got told I was going to fail those units before my final submission by my lecturers. I lost most of my motivation to study but it is one of the only thing that is giving me to opportunity to stay in Australia.

I have a partner working on the East Coast of Australia and I'm residing on the West. We have been dating for a year but it's been long distance the whole time. My partner is doing engineering and recently had raised an idea. At his current placement, drafters are in demand and I personally love drafting especially on AutoCAD, which fits the role perfectly as they are short staffed. He's asked me to consider handing in my resume and cv for a shot as its a tier 1 company and recognized internationally. My dilemma is that I've just started my masters and I do not think my parents would approve of me moving to the East Coast to work and drop my studies. I know for uni, it is possible to continue where you left off as long as you return within two years but I have a feeling once I start working I will never go back and the thought of having wasted AUD16k for this whole semester is really tearing me apart. I have yet to tell my parents that I've failed two subjects as well.

My parents are in actual strict to a degree but seem to believe personally that they are open and lenient with their kids. If I were to move to the East, it would mean I would be sharing accommodation with my partner which would be more economical but in Asian culture it is deemed inappropriate as we are not married or engaged. My parents are open but still tradition when it comes to dating. I am very lost and don't know what to do right now. Has anyone been in this situation? How did your parents react?

Tl;dr my partner is suggesting I move across the country to work and be with him and drop my masters degree, but due to strict parents, I'm not sure if this is a wise move. "

516,Can I just wipe vomit off a down jacket or do I need to wash it?,"My friend threw up and then wore my parka to get home. I'm assuming the stains on my jacket are residual (maybe from when she wiped her face or something, I don't know). I wiped most of it off for now but I'm wondering if I should actually do a full wash? Can it make me sick to just keep wearing a jacket that's had vomit on it even if I wiped everything (that was discernible to the eye) off?"
531,I bought (somewhat) expensive pajamas for the first time ever...,"After so many years working low-paying jobs and tireless hours, I've finally moved up in the world and have a decent paying job with excellent benefits. I've had the job for around a year now. For the first time ever I could afford and bought nice pajamas. It's something I've always wanted but never wanted to spend the money. Not more than a year ago, despite working 50+ hours a week, I used to have panic attacks about spending more than $50 at the grocery store.

 I don't know why it made me feel like I'm adulting. Maybe so many years sleeping in old t-shirts and my high school gym shorts. It's definitely a luxury purchase that I shouldn't get in the habit of making. But that's my adulting for the day."
561,Trying to move out but mom is making it difficult,"So, my plan is to move out towards the end of November. I made the mistake in telling my parents recently. My mom keeps on saying that I will not move out and that I can't move out. My mom had depression years ago and it seems like this has made her upset and my dad (diabetic) got out of a recent scare. I want to move out because I need to be away from my mom, the way she is isn't healthy or good for me and I realized it when I was close to breaking up with my boyfriend of a week. My boyfriend is a great guy and she had said that she didn't like him, and out of my need to please her, I wanted to break up with him. I began to distance myself from her. And today, I tried talking to my mom about moving out because she looked upset, again my mistake. She started going on about saying how my friend (who I haven't spent time with and will lie and say I'm with but I'm actually with boyfriend because I know she doesn't like him) is at fault because she is saying I should move out and that I don't know her at all. I commented to my friend about moving out, and she supported me. She then started saying it was my boyfriend's fault. Then she said she's been getting strange phone calls from a private number saying my boyfriend and I have had sex and that I'm in love with someone else. She started crying saying how I'm disappointing my dad and that I'm going to make his health worse. I've been wanting to leave my family since I was 16 and she's known this. I only believe her on my dad. She's saying she can make it so I don't move out too. I'm scared of my mom, honestly. If there is information needed, I'm an 18 year old female of Hispanic origin."
572,I don't know how car rentals work,"I'm [23f] planning a trip to see my mom who live in another state. I'm going with my boyfriend [24m] for the first time and we figured the best way to travel would be by car.

I figured the best way to start the car rental would be to look online for some deals. I found a great price through Priceline for an Advantage car rental. As I was going through the booking and entering my information the site asked if I was under 25. I selected the option 21-24 yrs old. I kept getting an error message that I could not complete the booking because I was either under 25 or I lived within 25 miles of the airport (the pickup location). I was confused and decided to try out the ""25 or older"" option. Of course the booking went through. 

Now I'm concerned that I won't be able to pickup the car because I'm definitely not 25 and it'll show on my drivers license. I also contacted Priceline and explained to them what happened. They offered to cancel my booking but they'll charge me a cancellation fee of $34.50. I don't want to pay this because their website wasn't very specific. I also tried contacting the pickup location office directly to get some info but I couldn't get in contact with anyone.

Has anyone ever had experience with renting a car under 25 that could help me out"
588,Worried about health insurance,"I'm 25 right now and currently worried about my upcoming birthday (in December) and getting my own health insurance. 

I'm at a point in my life where I've been having medical problems and excessive stress to the point where I don't think I'm able to work full time anymore. Which will mean.... I won't have benefits from work. 

Luckily, I work in the medical field so I understand for the most part how health insurance works and what I want and don't want. I'm just worried about the things I don't know...

I'm worried about the cost of the insurance especially if I'm unable to work full time due to my health. I don't want to go on Medicaid because then I'll lose access to the doctors who are currently treating me. 

How do you.... Buy health insurance? Where? Does anybody know? Anyone have to obtain their own health insurance outside of their job?"
590,Am I failing the Adulting Social aspect?,"Kind of a rant but maybe a real question.
I dont like to play cards. I don't know any card games. I dont like to sit around and play them, I never have. 
I don't enjoy board games either. Especially at this age. I just dont get the hype. I hate playing in groups, its always a shit show and I endure it and learn how to play but dont ACTUALLY have any fun and I wonder.
Does everyone else hate them too?
Am I defective and cant derive fun from anything but booze and Dungeons and Dragons?
Maybe I just have depression lol."
625,Asking for a raise? Am I crazy?,"I am a part-time college student (senior, will be graduating this year) with a part-time student job. It is not work-study so all the money I make goes to me and not my tuition. It's a job with extremely fluid scheduling meaning there are occasional weeks I may not work at all.

Before you come at me with ""just get a better job"", I am very happy with my job. I've not had the best luck with employment while I've gone through college and through this job I've finally found a place of employment that works perfectly in-sync with my school schedule and where I am treated as a person instead of an asset.

I do roughly the same amount of work as all my coworkers and we are all making minimum wage. We live in a state with one of the highest minimum wages in the US that is currently in the middle of a 5-year annual increase, so we essentially all got a raise over the summer.

But I'm a-strugglin'. I've picked up every extra shift I can but nobody can survive on minimum wage. I'm just barely scraping by and I'm using any resources I can to stay alive. My boyfriend is also working a minimum wage job but he works more hours than I do and I don't wish to be reliant on his income, we're a team.

I was encouraged by a friend the other night to ask for a raise; according to this friend, it's silly that I've worked this job for almost two years and never gotten a raise (well I *did* when minimum wage went up but he meant a raise I ""earned""). I don't know if I ""deserve"" a raise but that's probably just my negative self-talk. I'll only be working this job a few more months, until I graduate in June.

The thing is...How the hell do you even *ask* for a raise? Are raises given to student employees? How is asking for a raise going to make me look? Literally the only thing that comes to mind when I think about the concept of asking for a raise is that one moment from the Krusty Krab Training Video.

""Mr. Krabs, can I have a raise?""

""No.""

Advice please? Feel free to ask questions as well."
677,HELP! Need an ID for a job in 2 DAYS!!!,"Recently, I went to the DMV to buy a 2nd State ID for $30.

 Its on the way home via mail but I need it NOW. I received a paper copy of my photo ID which I have been using...

But I lost that too.

I would like to get another paper copy but I don't know how much it'll cost. I can't afford to replace the one that's already on its way for another $30 just for another paper. I only have $10.

As a request, I would just simply like to know if there's a possibility of going to the DMV for just a paper copy and nothing else. If so, I'd like to know how much it would cost.

I live in the state of CT and I've googled/been on their website a few times but couldn't find the information I need.

This is really important to me because I have a PPD for my job that's scheduled for TOMORROW"
693,"PSA: If your gums bleed when you brush/floss (even if you brush/floss every.single.day), you're already on the way to gingivitis and other gum disease.","**TL;DR: You really need to brush and floss more, or you could end up with gum disease, weak enamels, and eventually needing a $9k implant.**

Disclaimer: This is what I learned after finally going to the dentist for the first time in many years. (*Thanks, anxiety.*)  While I brush regularly, my flossing game was weak... maybe 3x/week.  I also had a shitty dentist for most of my life leading up to this.  I'm talking root canals with cavities in the fillings of the dead teeth because they were never capped; one tooth as cracked and is starting to separate (this needs to be extracted and an implant put in).  I'm towards the ""worst case scenario"" end of the spectrum.  If you have a great dentist and take fairly decent care of your teeth, you will probably not experience as extreme of a case as I have.

Firstly - you gotta brush AND floss each at least once a day.  Ideally, brushing twice a day, but as someone who deals with mental health issues and sometimes sheer laziness, once is all that's gonna happen.  You want to floss/brush at the same time each day because bacteria in plaque can start to form colonies that produce tartar in 24 hours.  Flossing breaks those colonies up between the teeth and at the gums, and brushing gets it on the surface and at the gum line.

Second - if you have a sweet tooth like me, you can still enjoy your sugar but not damage your teeth.  It's not the quantity of sugar, but the frequency of exposing your teeth to it.  So, try to keep your candy to once a day.  If you gotta snack on those M&amp;Ms a couple times throughout the day, give your mouth a rinse after OR chew a sugar-free gum with xylitol as the main ingredient.  Xylitol is an artificial sweetener that has a few other health benefits, but for this post, the most important is anti-cavity properties.  You can get gum, mints, and even a powdered substitute for things like your daily cup of joe.

Now, onto the bad news.  If you're bleeding, you're inflamed.  If you're inflamed, it's a bacterial infection.

While some minor/occasional bleeding might just be some irritation, if you are a chronic bleeder despite brushing and flossing like you're supposed to, it's a sign of inflammation and infection.  I was surprised to learn that the bleeding wasn't just irritation, but rather signs of gingivitis, and in one corner of my mouth, verging on periodontal disease. (Pro tip if you've got a tiny-ass mouth like me: You gotta relax your jaw and let your cheeks loose to get the toothbrush in there.  Bonus tip: A fucking kids toothbrush... a tiny baby tooth brush fits perfectly back there.  Using two brushes is kind of extra and dumb, but I don't know... I'd like to keep my teeth and I'm really close to losing those molars.) 

The good news is as long as you haven't reached full on periodontal disease, the inflammation and infection can be reversed.  I'm currently on a prescribed anti-microbial rinse, as well as a ridiculously expensive but VERY HIGHLY fluoride-concentrated toothpaste.  Assuming I actually floss and brush once a day and keep my sugar stuff under control, and use the rinse once a day, I can reverse my signs of infection in about two weeks.

TheraBreath Healthy Gums oral rinse is available in most stores and online.  Colgate Prevident toothpaste is a highly fluoride-concentrated toothpaste, as is the Fluoridex toothpaste I was given.  Both are available online.  Get some floss.  Use it.  Buy one and go buck wild with it for two weeks while you brush and rinse.  Use one whole container.  After two weeks, grab another one and use that regularly, but not as ridiculously like you did the first two weeks.  But you gotta go to the dentist at some point.  If you have tartar along the gum line, it just traps the bacteria underneath and in the gums.

Anyway thanks for coming to my ToothTalk."
694,Is $30k a year a decent salary for one person?,"I'm currently a student, not graduating until next year but I'm already skimming through job sites trying to see what's out there. And I feel so lost, I don't know what an entry level job is supposed to offer. I work in a library now, so I'll have some experience to put on a resume (history major looking for, hopefully, library/archival related work, but anything that pays decent, really).

I see a lot of jobs that pay $30k, and I have no idea if that's good or not. My dad says it's nothing, but I've heard other people say it's good. I know it can depend on the area as to whether that's decent or not, but just for some kind of reference, none of these are in big cities.

I don't know what to do, I'm freaking out about life and the future, I don't know what to apply for, what to ask for. I don't want much in life, just a decent place to live and to not be living paycheck to paycheck. Please help."
716,How do you decide what you want in life?,"As a kid everything was kind of just set up for me. I went to school, went to college, and then BAM real world, now I can really make my own decisions about life. 

I have so many things I want in life but a lot are conflicting. How do I separate fantasy from reality? And if I want multiple conflicting things, how do I cope with the fact that I can't have both? 

I know I DO actually want to live somewhere warm, but in reality I won't move from where I live now because my boyfriend doesn't want to leave his family. Most of my family moved away and it sucks and I would never make him do the same. I have one close family member still here and don't want to leave him, either. 

So I'll put the ""living somewhere warm"" idea in the Fantasy Box. 

But then there is whether or not I want kids in my 30s. I don't know the answer to that. What if I want a life without kids AND I want a life with kids?

Do I want a house in the suburbs? Live in a small town where everyone knows each other? 

Do I want to be a hard-working career woman or would I be happier being a stay at home mom? Or having a job where I go to work and do my thing and not have to be in charge? 

How do people answer these questions and make these decisions? I feel like I'm just coasting through life right now because I don't know what I want so I'm stuck. I don't want to wake up at 50 years old and realized I missed so many years where I could have done so much more."

747,"How much of this is my ""fault""? How do I get better at being proactive or organizing my mind differently?","Basically, just moved into step-uncle's old room maybe a month ago. Am 21. Also lack all kinds of organizational skills, etc., so idunno. I tried asking my parents for help a few times for advice/guidance on how to store and organize things, and I never really got help, so I never took care of those things. 

My brain usually goes --&gt; this thing first, 'then' this, THEN this, and THEN this. Has to go in that order, otherwise it feels wrong, uncomfortable, or I just struggle to do it properly. In this case, that means 'things that go on the wall', which my dad (step-dad) doesn't want any tape on, and nails, only thumbtacks, etc. But how do I put a whiteboard up with thumbtacks? How do I organize anything without that particular whiteboard to makes a list/timeline? How do I store my games without shelves, and how do I put those shelves up on the wall with thumbtacks, too? 

I'm also not meant to keep my hamper as a storage space, but I have no idea where to put the socks that are there because I don't know how many to keep. I'm not sure what a reasonable amount of socks for someone should be? (Especially of different varieties) How much space should that take up in my drawers, how 'many' drawers? So my laundry's piled up because I only had the one hamper, and haven't really been looking at either of them because the socks still haven't been taken care of.

I also have a bad habit of hoarding cups in my room, water bottles, etc. which I'm prohibited from but end up doing anyway. Thermoses help but then you have to clean them out the next day. 

So, if there's an answer from anyone out there, what should I do? How do I ""fix"" it?"
752,Please give me some advice to cope with HS nostalgia," 

If you can see this, please give me some advice on how to cope and talk to me.

I miss my classmates and friends in HS; nowadays these friends are pretty much gone; I miss the days when we do not need to work; nowadays you're expected to get an internship during sophomore summer; currently 20M here, missing my high school days and cliques.

College is sorta like a grey area between school and work, and the textbooks are fracking hard.

I don't know if this is the correct place to post this, but i became more depressed starting from college. You're expected to find a work/school balance **where school itself is already competitive and harder than ever.**

College turned out to be way more depressing then I thought, and it destroyed every confidence I ever had.

I was told that work (after college) would be 10 times harder.

Now i'm at the point where everything after this college will be more stressful, and I'll be afraid that i'll have a mental breakdown.

Looking at my peers, straight As; actually having plans at life; but I dont. Remember in middle/high school I was more sure of myself and where I would go; nowadays I just feel smaller than ever.

I'm not sure if this is the right sub to post this, but life after 18 is way too hard for me."
753,What can I do to become an adult even though I have autism?,"Here's my situation. I'm 24, never held a proper job in my life. I want out of my parents house so bad. I'm also trans. They refuse to let me transition. I can't seem to hold a job or get a hand on my own finances. My mom is my rep payee and manages my social security checks because I can't handle money. I'm so bad I wasted my money on two lightsabers I can't return. 

On the job I do well for a day or two but end up wanting to quit. I hate working and can't seem to enjoy it. I hate retail. I don't know how all the other mindless zombies can work retail and act fine. I end up freaking out really quickly. In one job I had I stocked milk and ended up screaming in the freezer banging my head against boxes.

Look, should I just give up hope? I'm so far gone. I can't even tie my own shoes I buy Velcro shoes. I don't know how to do laundry, I know how to cook but not how to clean behind myself. I'm so far gone I can sit at the computer 6 hours straight no breaks. 

Despite all this I have goals and ambitions. I would like to learn French. One problem with that is I constantly change my target language and goals. I fantasize about the future and don't actually do anything. I just kinda day dream.

I don't know what to do anymore. I want to be an adult I just don't know if I can.

Is it too late for me?"
769,What to eat with bread,"Most people in my country (Belgium) eat bread for breakfast and lunch, 2 times a day up to 7 days a week. Bread in my country is eaten in the form of 2 slices, with something else in between. The picture gives you an idea, I don't know how common this is in America and Asia, so I thought it's better to explain like I'm 5. https://imgur.com/NoyASUv Bread is cheap, so eating bread is a good idea. 

However I am struggling with the different possible toppings. The most frequently used topping are jams, chocolate paste, special salads like surimi or chicken curry... Most of these things contain high amounts of sugars, salts or fat. Every time I study the nutritional information of the most common bread toppings I become depressed. I am even doubting if I couldn't just eat fast food in stead.  Some stores give their products a nutritional score, and I kid you not, some of these toppings have the same rating as ice cream. I legit ate ice cream for breakfast when I found that out, cause why even bother making an effort anymore.

So I am looking for ideas. Things to eat with my bread, that are actually good for me. I will eat this on an almost daily basis, so it can't be too expensive. I would also like something that doesn't require too much preparation. I could for example boil 30 eggs and last an entire week, but I don't want to legit start cooking and peeling and what not, every single morning and afternoon only to eat some breakfast. Ideal scenario would be to simply grab something from the fridge and fuck yeah spread it. Ready to go. The only thing left is cheese and ham, but I need more than that. So ideas are welcome."

820,Is this what weekends (and life) are supposed to look like?,"Recently graduated college and am out working in the real world. I normally work 40-50 hours per week, so have quite a bit of time to myself now that I am not studying all the time. I am fortunate to have landed a job and to be working from home for the time being due to COVID.

After graduation I moved back into my parents house (and maybe that is the problem), and I feel so 'blah.' Figured it would be worth it to save thousands of dollars from rent, as there wouldn't be much going on with the pandemic ravaging my state when I moved back in. My college hobbies of hanging out with friends, going to bars, traveling, extracurriculars are all gone. I feel like every day is the same: M-F I wake up, work, get some exercise, eat dinner, shower, then bed. But on the weekends this feeling is terrible - I would honestly rather be working, at least I would have some interaction with people and would be productive.

Is this feeling of emptiness, boredom, and dispair stemming from being an adult? From living at home? From COVID social distancing? Not having a real hobby anymore? Just regular winter blues?

I truthfully don't know how to fix it - I have tons of cash from living at home so I have the means to pursue something. I used to have a motorcycle that I sold, so I have been thinking about getting another bike, but that doesn't really help since it is winter here. I have enough money to buy a house/go rent an apartment, but honestly fear the loneliness that will ensue from working from home all day, only to clock out and be alone all night. I can't really go make new friends or try new things with COVID and I just feel stuck. 

Most weekends I find myself looking forward to Monday, for at least then I will have something to keep me occupied and will get the itch to be social scratched through my Zoom meetings.

This isn't the post-graduation life I envisioned, and maybe I had my hopes too high. But man, I'm just so tired of waiting for time to pass."
822,How does one get a job out of state before moving?,"I don't know the logistics behind the transition process. I've learned apartments don't want to rent out to someone who doesn't have a job, but how do I get a job in a new state when I don't live there? Should I be planning a trip to make a round of interviews and move when I know I've landed a job? I have years of experience in retail so I know I'm hirable I'm just not sure what order to do things. I'm sitting on a decent lump of cash I've saved over the years, is it unlikely that will convince apartments to rent to me? I really don't know what I'm doing, just want to get out of california."
830,How do I DRESS like an adult?,"Hello, fellow adults.

So I'm needing some pretty big advice on how to dress myself. I am a 25 year old female and, due to not growing very much over the years, still wear the exact same stuff I wore in middle school. No joke. I don't have a lot of money, and again I don't grow much, so I figured hey if it's not broken don't fix it, right? Well, a couple of weeks back, I went to a mall for the first time in a looooong time and I nearly broke down in tears because nobody looked like me. Nobody. All of the women were so adult looking and they all had makeup on and they all looked fierce and all of them varied in fashion but all of them looked so well put together. I passed girls who were probably 16 years old dressing more adult than me. 

For references, I mostly wear hoodies and blue jeans. If it's too hot for the hoodie, I wear just a t-shirt and blue jeans. I don't exactly have a style, and I'm not quite sure how to find which style I like. For a starting point though, one of my friends said that I have a ""grungy hippie aesthetic"", and I do like both of the grunge and hippie styles, I just don't know where to start. Is there a store I can just go into to get like a starter outfit to see if I like it or not? Again, I don't have a lot of money, so this whole thing is gonna be a struggle for me. I just wanna dress like a 25 year old, not a 14 year old. I so wish I could just have someone else dress me. If you guys pick out an outfit for me, I wouldn't mind at ALL. In fact, I'd prefer it because trying to choose the outfit is what's stressing me out so much."
831,How does a proper adult handle something he doesn't like in others? I mean children or animals bad behaviour,"My dad mostly put fear in me and I fear from him to this day. I fear that he will one day just click and give me the biggest hit of his life in my chest or something.

I just got a cat and I notice the same, bad behaviour as just like my father did. I made my cat getting scared from me and I just almost manically told him to bite me, because I'm stronger anyway... I ALWAYS.... ALWAYS... ALWAYS... Hated these kind of people who did something like this to a cat or anybody. And I feel like I'm burning out from the too much stress that I can't handle... And I start to behave like this because I'm having enough from the shitty people... Why do they keep hurting us? F*ck them :( we did nothing and randomly from out of nowhere keep hurting us.

So.. is there any way to handle this situation? I get sometimes angry to my cat because he scratches the furniture. And I want to handle it better then just plain getting angry and """"instinctively"""" (from my past father's/mom's experience, which I would like to change. That's the point of this post) scaring him. 

I don't want to hit him, scare him, fear from me etc.
Like I got him because I used to love cats and cute animals since I was a kid :/ I still love them I just feel like I'm getting 0 love from my parents and anyone nearby me and I'm really, really drowning mentally...

To be honest I felt like this day would come since I was a child. :C because I cannot change people around me and when I want to just stay normal I get stressed, sad and depressed and no one understands me why. And instinctively we choose the ""better"" path than sacrificing ourselves for nothing... I'm keep holding in this huge amount of stress since I was 13 and I'm 21 now. :/ I even told other people that I want to die at 13 because of this amount of stress. And now I'm really considering it as an option. :/ I really start to not see hope anymore. I can't live my life in this stress for others to stay a good person and let myself suffer. But if I don't stay I'm just turning into a scared-garbage who can't control his fear. I hate this type of human behaviour. I don't love it...

I tried seeking therapist etc. But I just want to stop. I don't really like this therapy thing and helps nothing really. I don't want to open up that much because I am a pretty big drama king and I know I can just dig myself very deeply into weird shit. I know there is a way to handle this... Maybe I should just leave these people and somehow stand up for myself even tho my father hurts me. And I'm also considering suicide as a true option because... Well I don't know really."

My left wrist hurts too but the ortho place I went to yesterday would only look at one wrist at a time. I didn't think that either was broken, but now since my right wrist is broken and my left hurts in the same way but not as bad, I worry that I should get that one x-rayed and checked out. One of my issues is I'm afraid they will cast my other wrist as well and don't know how I will handle six weeks of having casts on both arms. I've never had a broken bone before.

881,medical transcription how much is the course and is it worth it (Canadian)," I'm sort of a terrible adult I've never been great at the whole career thing I've always had jobs to survive and then I had a kid and I did that for a long time and then I got back into doing makeup and a few years later a pandemic hit and makeup's not what I want to do anymore, I don't want to rely on the public to keep myself safe.
So I'm looking at a new career path and medical transcription seems to be a popular work from home option which would be ideal because starting in the fall my child will be in kindergarten.

918,Bought a dashcam.,"I've had one sitting on my Amazon wish list for years.  There have been a lot of close encounters where people were just idiots while driving, especially when I commuted up the highway for work.  

A few months ago, I was in the grocery store parking lot backing out of my space, ready to put my car in drive.  The car a few spaces down backed up.  They backed up more and more.  I honked, first in spurts and then one long honk and BAM - they backed right into me.  I thought in my head what an idiot I was for not getting the dashcam, as this lady will probably get out and say I rear ended her, with no proof (except maybe the store has cameras, don't know).  It was a yoga pants lady in her 30's and her yoga pants (I assume) teenage daughter, they got out and asked if I was okay.  We looked at the cars, mine didn't have a scratch as they were going really slowly.  They apologized and said we could exchange insurance or wait for police if I wanted to.  I decided to let this one go (spur of the moment decision) and we all left.  But I thought she was going to scam me.

So it's finally arriving tomorrow and I can't wait to have that peace of mind on the road.  People are fucking horrible drivers.  A dashcam only makes sense.

This feels like a fair bit of adulting to me.  

Anyone else get a dashcam?"

987,20 and lost.,"I'm 20, I live at home, and my savings is pretty much empty. Not because I didn't save money though. I had about 1300 saved up at the beginning of the summer but when I was working as a summer camp counselor, expenses kept popping up. By now, I'm down to 245 in my savings and all of that is going to rent at the end of the month. I just had surgery last week, which has meant I can't work for the next few weeks so essentially I'm broke and I'm only seasonal at my position. 

My problem is, I don't know what to do next. I'll be able to get some job in food service or retail, but I need more than that and my family reminds me of that. I should get a career or interest that'll earn me enough money to get my own place.

My interests constantly change. For 6 months I was into culinary arts, on and off since childhood I've been into writing, etc. Right now I'm on the kick of becoming an herbalist. I don't know what I'm supposed to do to help me decide on something that I can do so I can move out, hopefully by the end of 2019."
989,Help getting drivers license,"Hey ya'll I'm (23M) from Texas and it's a bit embarrassing to admit but I have no idea how to get my drivers license.

999,How do I detangle from a toxic friendship?,"I am 46, but don't know of a more suitable sub. To be honest, I prefer to not have friends. The majority of people I run into want to either use me in some way or control me in some way. Anyway,  what I need are emotionally-safe friends, preferably superficial, without peer pressure, being given ANY limits, being held to the past, helped without my express prior consent, or mothered/babied/nurtured in ANY way. It is important that any friends I have constantly avoid acting like a frigging parent over me and realize that every least way I do things is my own PRIVATE business and that I constantly do everything according to what is best for me. In other words, I need self-contained and conservative, but permissive, friends who understand that is how I am and never doubt my ability to run my own life unassisted. I need for others to constantly realize that I do everything the correct way for me that has nothing to do with them. I need for others to NEVER comment on what they pretend are flaws like a parent would over a child. Instead, they should accept me as I am and respect my right to remain as I am forever and constantly get to do things that only affect me my own way. I have the constant need to have adventure, take risks, prove myself (to others to earn not being helped or taken care of), do things the hard way, push myself, and live on constant whim.

Anyway, I met a friend online around 2002-2003 or so. This person is intersexed, mutilated as a child, raised as a boy, etc. Had I known about her lifetime character defects such as always needing to be right, being a goody two-shoes, having a persecution complex, always knowing the best way to do things without having the empathy to understand that others may want to do things other ways, etc., I'd have never accepted her friendship. In some ways, I feel I was led on. We are not the most compatible and yet cannot separate. Maybe that's the true definition of a ""soul mate"" -- the person you can neither get along with nor escape.

And it keeps getting worse where she misinterprets everything I do or say, hangs up on me, and doesn't trust me in emotional circumstances. Like I will start to wind down a conversation, and she will see my closing statement as an opening. Or she fears I am going somewhere in a conversation where I never was and hangs up on me. She seems to hang up on me for all the same reasons that drive men to want to rape. I am equating nothing, just saying that her hanging up is her way to ultimately win, control others, disrespect, and humiliate. I am sick of it.

I don't want to turn my back on her, but I want out. I feel I need out for my own sanity. And I need to find compatible friends who know their place and act with equals without trying to mother/baby/control/change/fix me in the least. I've never been able to find that. Like I said, most who try to become my friends either want something or want to control me. I just wish I could tell the whole world that my parents are dead, I never wanted them in my life, never asked for them, and that I am entitled to NOT have people who act like that in my life. I don't want to ""heal,"" ""grow,"" ""change,"" or other words that abusers throw around. I just want to remain as I am forever and have the entire universe honor that, regardless of what my Akashic Records or whatever say."
1005,About to stumble into adulthood,"I've just recently turned 17 and I'm a good portion into my junior year of high school. I live in California, and my parents and I decided we'd be movnig out of state once I graduated for numerous reasons. We're not sure when we'll be able to leave, so I have to assume that I'll still be spending some time out here in California before I leave. My tight group of friends [4 including me] (one of them is my girlfriend, and we all became friends from being on the same team) are considering buying an apartment together since the other three are pretty much getting kicked out once they graduate. We're looking at two bedroom apartments (one room for my girlfriend and I, the other for the other two (also dating)) and it seems to be a reasonable thing for us to accomplish; some of the cheaper apartments in our area are running about $1.9K ent/month, and if we split the rent evenly that's about $475 per person. We have another friend who's offering to help with rent, but I don't want to rely on her and something happen to where she can't/won't help us. 

My problem here is that I don't really know anything about being an adult. I didn't grow up with a lot of money so I'm good at budgeting, but that's about it. I don't know what you need to have in your first apartment/house, what to put into an emergency kit, how to pay bills, anything. My parents had been working for a few years before they graduated high school so they had money saved up to help them when they graduated and for college, and I don't have a job currently (I live about 40 minutes away from my school so getting a job without having a liscense or a car is really tricky). Wha advice do you have for an almost-adult about to step into the real world? What's something you wish you knew before you got an apartment? Things that would help to know so I can somewhat survive my first years of adulthood? 

TLDR; i have some time before i graduate but i'm trying to prepare for adulthood before it slaps me in the face."
1006,Is this damage worth asking my apartment management to repair it?,"Hey guys, 

I'm 21 and have been living in the same apartment for a year and 4 months now. Upon moving into the apartment, I noticed the shower tiles were cracked and damaged, but I didn't really think much of it. 

I don't know if it has somehow gotten worse (I live alone, and neither me nor any of my guests have damaged it), but it's beginning to bother me a lot more. I'm also only now noticing tiles that are loose as well. I'll include some links to images of the shower tiles below. 

Pease, 1) let me know if this is something I should/can bother management about, and 2) if so, how do I explain that the tile was like that when I moved in, and either it has begun to bother me more or has somehow gotten worse? Thanks in advance!

1008,Health Insurance help life dump/venting,"So life dump as of recent. Basically though I just quit my job, (but I have some monies saved up so I'm k) my car is currently not working (Kevin pls help) and I need to have blood test and a CT scan done within less than a month (as requested by an Ophthalmologist)  - any information on help for getting insurance

27/f I live in Reno, NV I am still currently a CA resident though, my credit is shit (not sure if this would be a thing, fuck if it is) and I haven't been to a DR in over like 10 years so I'm due.

&amp;#x200B;

Full Story Time!!

Last week my car decided to stop working, I/bf/family assume it's the starter but I do have a friend coming to look at it tomorrow he has one of those diagnostic kits and then I can figure that out. Due to that I have been taking an uber to and from work. I just had my weekend on tues/weds this week, I noticed Tuesday night above my right eye lid was a bit swollen and there was a bit of pressure, after poking around a bit I lifted my eye lid to see a white mass thing to the right side and I just lost it. My sister is going to nursing school and had a test the next morning so I didn't tell her about it till Wednesday night after work. (Not messing with this woman's grades...)  I was still just trying to stay calm because I didn't know what it was. After I told Kalyn (sister) she informed me she has a friend who is an Ophthalmologist assistant, she was able to get me in Friday for an emergency appointment, now keep in mind I don't have insurance so my sister and I had to pay out of pocket and thanks to her friend it was cheaper then it could have been but we had to wait till Friday, so I worked Thursday and didn't say anything to anyone because I didn't know my sister had accepted the appointment. I was just still freaking out about (what I was hoping wasn't a tumor (my dad just beat lymphoma go dad!) and stressing about telling my sister and how she would react. I knew it may need to been seen immediately but I figured if it's medical related my boss wouldn't mind. I'm also a very anxious person by nature and have been stressing about my car, now my health and tossing my boss in the mix is just mean...

So I see the DR who tells me my right Meibomian Glad was swollen and it could be caused from a number of things but generally leads to an immune deficiency. So now I have to get blood drawn next week and I have a CT scan set for Nov 1st and a follow up with my DR on Nov 30.

Thursday night after I got off work Kalyns friend said my appointment was at 930am I texted my boss I will go in 930 I was not sure when I will be done but I will come back to work as soon as I was able. He replied telling me I needed to be to be back by 2pm which was fine. Plenty of time, after everything was said and done with my appointment my sister dropped me off at work. Now let me say I was already apprehensive to go into work because my boss has a tendency to lecture me about how I am unreliable anytime I call in or ask to come in late. So I show up around 1:35 explain to him whats happening/give him the DR's note and inform him that I will need to do blood testing next week. The first thing he says is to make sure it's on my day off. I agree and said I intended to-to which he asked to have a meeting in his office. The meeting was him explaining that me requesting and taking days off means he has to cover my shifts and I should see that as somewhat embarrassing to have my boss cover my shifts. He is the only other receptionist at his business besides me. I've worked for him for 6 months and he said I have asked for 2 weeks total off. A week of it was requested before employment and he admitted, 3 days was a request to visit my dad while he started radiation, one was a free snow day he gave me and the other three would be sick days or days I'm counting of me showing up to work, leaving to do something and returning to finish my shift. I was also bawling through all of this. The last thing he asked/said to me before I told him I was done talking to him and walked out was "" I've noticed your lack of enthusiasm to work here lately, is it because you're looking for another job?""  I just feel exhausted and used. I'm responsible for my person and as such I decided to quit to be able to worry about my health. Fuck you James.

&amp;#x200B;

That's it, give me insurance info, anything would be helpful. I don't know what it is or even if I'm sick, maybe it's something simple. Can a UTI can cause this? that'd be neat. Either way thank you. Should I post this in a different subreddit?"
1023,Is everything supposed to feel like the wrong thing?,"I \[26f\] have been grappling with whether or not to fix or sell my car (car will cost almost 3 grand to fix but should last another 5 years if not more). I've also been grappling with leaving my fast track career retail job to go back to school for physical therapy assistance. So here is my issue: 

fixing the car feels like the wrong thing to do

selling the car and losing my reliable transportation feels like the wrong thing to do

staying at the job feels like the wrong thing to do

leaving that job for school seems like the wrong and right thing to do (but also not the right thing to do if that makes sense)

How can I tell what I should do if it all feels the same? I guess there is no real way to know what will get the best results so you just have to risk things and try stuff and if a disaster happens then you'll probably know how to turn things around even if it'll suck for a while? I don't know lol"
1047,What to do when you move states,"So say I've gotten my first big id job and moved to a new state. I hear I suppose to change my drivers license and car registration and what not. But what if I'm not planning on staying at my current apartment for long? I'll be moving (witihin the state) again in about 6 months. Do I have to change it again? My old address is my parents house and they can easily send me everything I need and know where I will be. Missing out on any potential mail, traffic tickets or what have you is not a problem. I don't know why else people change their address on official documents though. I don't even now how to prove that I live here since all the utilities are included in rent too."
1055,What do I do when I'm sick and have responsibilities,"I have work and quiz etc. to do for Uni and my sinuses are murdering me.

Do I push through and suffer. Talk to my professors? I don't know."
1185,Title/moving states questions,"Hi-

I'm mostly asking for some advice here.  My title for my car is in my dad and my names.  I am not on speaking terms with my parents right now and I'm looking to leave the state sometime very soon.  Do I need a new title when I relocate?  If so, is that going to be impossible to get when a) I don't have a copy of the first one (one of the only important documents I couldn't find at my parents house before I left--I think that the DMV can print me out a new one but I have no permanent address for them to send it to right now, so hopefully they can do that if I go in for a copy?), and b) I probably can't get my dad's consent to take his name off the title (I can try but I don't know how it'll go given that I'm not speaking to them currently and he won't want me moving)?

How do I go about getting a new title/registration/plates all of that when I move if my dad is on the title as well?  The car is paid off and I've been the sole user for over three years now, if that makes any difference.  I'm also 23."
1219,How do I sell my car?,"I just recently bought my first car and I have no clue how to get rid of it. I don't want it anymore and I'm leaving the state. I just don't understand all the technical aspects and legal aspects of owning a car -- and to be frank thinking about it or trying to understand it (especially the why aspect of it) just pisses me off...

I was just wondering, how do I sell my car? It's fully paid off and I have insurance and registration for it. Is it legal for me to just sell it on Craigslist without returning the license plates and cancelling my insurance and whatnot? I don't have a ride to the DMV as I'm the only one in my close family who drives (so it's either I choose to drive to the DMV and get rid of the license plate and risk getting caught driving without a plate on the way back home OR it's I just get rid of the car)...

IDK. How can I legally get rid of this thing while cancelling my insurance and registration bullshit? My father was the first one to show me how to go about getting all of this, he was knowledgeable on how to do it, though I don't have him around anymore so I don't know how tf to get rid of all of this myself...

What are the financial and legal repercussions of me just not returning my license plate and not paying my insurance and just selling my car on Craigslist? Because I honestly can't be bothered to walk or ride my bike all the way to the DMV, and all the way to the auto insurance office, and then all the way back home just to sell my damn car that I don't even want... Is there an easier method of getting rid of this POS?

P.S. SORRY FOR THE LANGUAGE IM JUST UPSET"
1230,When should I go see a doctor? [M19],"Hopefully this post is okay for this subreddit, but I am a college student and I am new to this idea of semi-adulting. About a little over a week ago I went to one of those trampoline places and ended up landing on my finger incorrectly, which has caused it to hurt. I figured the pain would go away in a couple of days (maybe just bruised), however it has been over a week and it still hurts (but not as much as it did initially). I would ask my parents about this, but they seem to always choose the ""man-up"" aspect and I have been, but I still get a pain that shoots through me when I even as much tap my finger. I guess I don't know if I should just pop into a CVS and get a finger cast and ride it out, or see if I did actual damage. Thanks for any help, I really appreciate it!

1245,Did I do the right thing?,"I don't know if this is the right sub but tonight I was with some friends and we were leaving a movie theater. It's late; we're ready to go home, etc. As we're leaving, there's a man in the plaza. His car has the hazards on, he's waving, and he seems really distraught. We stopped and listened but my friends in the back insisted we leave because he could be dangerous, which I could see. He said he was out of gas, had no money, and had his young daughter in the car, but I couldn't see anyone in the car or not. I wanted to give him the few dollars I had in my pocket but we left before I had a chance. I'm pretty naive but was this real? We were in a relatively nice area but his story seemed a little fishy to me. Was this a trap or were we just assholes? Sorry for bad grammar I'm very tired.  "
1249,Apartment smells like chemical smoke. Please help.,"Five months ago I moved into a semi-nice apartment that was advertised as newly renovated. All the appliances were brand new. (Also a bit of required context: I have allergies and asthma. I am also young and don't know much about moving into a new place) On the third night at my new apartment I turned the oven on to make pizza, after three minutes I looked over a saw smokey fumes rising from the oven. I instantly turned the oven off. I googled new oven fuming and read that many new ovens have factory chemicals that need to be burned off before actual use. I also read that the room should be well ventilated and that birds exposed to oven fumes may die. I live in a studio apartment and decided I didn't want to be around while these toxic bird killing fumes were being created. I was worried about having my oven on for too long while I was out so I switched it to self clean because that is on a timer. I thought self clean is probably exactly what would take care of the factory chemical problem. Anyways when I come back from being out with friends my apartment is filled with these nasty fumes. I open all the windows. I run to a store and buy a two fans and set them up. At this point I'm pissed and worried. I have breathing problems as it is and now my appliance manufacturing company expects me to deal with the toxic fumes created by turning on their oven. Fuck them and fuck my newly renovated apartment for not mentioning this shit or providing a user manual for any of the appliances. Even with my windows open, fans going, and leaving my apartment door wide open, like a weirdo, the chemical smell doesn't go away. It's not the worst thing but it's enough to hate paying for this relatively ""nice"" apartment. It's kind of like when you buy a new mattress and it smells chemically but the smell is always there. I was too much of a push over to advocate for myself when this oven thing happened and I kinda feel like part of it is my fault for putting the oven on self clean but forgetting to take out the metal oven racks, I read that you have to take the oven racks out during the self cleaning process because they have a finishing coat that will burn during the high heat process. I decide ok maybe I can just live with this till my lease is up. So fast forward to now. I have had a cancer diagnosis. It is not an aggressive cancer but enough to have to go to the doctor a lot. I get surgery to get the malignant tumor removed. But the doctor says I have to get CT scans every couple of months or so to make sure the cancer doesn't come back. Now I am anxious and hyper aware of chemicals in my life that could be carcinogens. One night I am doing homework at a grocery store seating area because I don't want to be in my weird smelling possibly harmful apartment. I check my email and see a customer satisfaction survey sent by my apartment's property management company. It's late I'm anxious, I'm pissed, and I just kind of go off in this survey about how ""I wouldn't ever recommend this place to a friend because my studio sucks and is probably unhealthy"" I also mention that the hall smells like mildew since some guy's washer flooded and even though they replaced the hall carpet they didn't take care of the underlying moisture problem and two of my outlet panels don't work and my sliding bathroom door scrapes of some paint everytime it slides. All these things kinda suck but they would be bearable if it wasn't for my apartment having smoke damage. I have trouble doing anything in my apartment because all I can think about is how this place might make my acinic cell carcinoma come back. I don't know how to deal with this. I got a call today talking about how they want to look at my apartment because of the survey and my apartment is a mess because I try to use it only for sleeping so I never clean my paper/mail up and I leave my clothes on the floor until I decide to do a load of laundry. I feel like they wont take me seriously and if they do then I have to clean up the messy library that is my unit. What could they do to make the chemical smell go away. Would they send in a smoke restoration team? What if that doesn't work? What if they just write it off as a weird apartment smell. Cause when I was little I did live in a ghetto place that always had a vague smell of cigarettes, fried food, and old people clothes. So it is normal for apartments to smell kinda weird but there is a difference between drunk person smell and factory chemical smell. Any advice? Thanks for reading. I love you reddit people."
1258,Pros/Cons of living closer to work and away from the city?,"Context: 
I'm a 21yoF moving across the coutnry to start a new job. My offices would be 30 minutes (+/- 10min with traffic) out of the city center, and it's closer to a suburban area with a more family feel. Housing options are definitely much more worth my $ if I live closer to work, and I found some options for decent housing about 10 minutes away. I've been told that being a single young person moving to a new city, I should consider living near to the city, but is 30-40 minutes really that big of an issue if I wanted to go downtown? It's just that the ones closer downtown are really crummy in comparison to how much I'd save if I lived further out. 

I don't mind going out but it's not a dealbreaker if I have to drive or uber. Sure, I'd like to keep busy, but I feel like I can still do that if I live further out? I don't know, most of my new incoming coworkers have been discussing it and it's been a 50-50 split between living close to the city vs further out. My only concern is that most of them are from the area, so they already have friends from college/from the area. The ones living closer to the city are ones who are moving like me, and so I feel like that might be a choice that I should make? I plan on volunteering or joining activities to help meet new people/make new friends outside of work, too. Would meeting new people be that big of an issue if I lived further out? What would you do if you were me? Is it that bad to live close to work? Any help or thoughts are much appreciated!"
1269,Section 8 Housing &amp; Car insurance for 21yo,"My dad is threatening me to get out of the house if my birds don't get out of his property. I still want them, but looking around to see places that can hold them till I'm out of his house and find a place to be with them. 

That said, how does Section 8 Housing work ? I've always heard about it, but my parents never told me or siblings anything bc they were afraid of us getting ""ideas"" or something 😑 My coworker mentioned a little of it to me, and explained a bit. But still worried I might not be applicable for Section 8 Housing and such bc it's my first time living alone, low income, pets to be included, etc.

My dad is also threatening to take me out of car insurance &amp; health, which is fine for health bc my job actually offers health coverage. I'd just have apply for it when it rolls around again. But car insurance is another thing, and it's another thing they chose to keep quiet from us bc we're ""don't know anything kids"". I know car insurance for teens to young adults is expensive, but would there be a way to get either government aid in car insurance ? Or somewhere to offer some basic coverage that's not expensive ?

I wanted to slowly build up independence from them &amp; move away over the years as it's just been emotional abuse, mainly from my dad. But it looks like it's happening faster than I wanted and the people I'm suppose to turn to aren't there for me the most. "
1289,17 y/o high schooler planning to move out because of abusive half sister,"I hate living at home  with my abusive half sister in her late 30's who lives with us. She doesn't know how to let things go, has pushed me, given me bruises, hella delusional, and has even threatened to take me to court for spitting on her car and thinks I egged her car which I would have admitted to if I did. She can't get along with lots of people at work  and all of my family has told me she's always been the same and will never change. My parents won't do anything about because she's a ""legal"" adult and they're helping her out by letting her live here.  I've been living like this for 6 years, I'm tired of it and want to get away for my own well being  so I've made the decision to move out. I took a finance class so I feel like know the financial basics of being independent like bills, interest rates, insurance ect. A rough estimate of a part time job is 600 monthly and I have budgeted my groceries at 120 a month, planning to get a bus pass and a bike, and a phone plan with 60 a month. The biggest trouble is affordable rent. I'm planning to live on my own and the average cost of rent where I live is 900, 400 in bad areas with crappy maintenance. I want roommates but I don't know anyone and am too afraid that it can be dangerous. My goal is to move out by December this year. Any advice/ things I should know? "
1350,I'm 23 and I have no clue on how to adult,"I'm currently in my senior year of college and I'm about to graduate this fall. So naturally, I'm excited, but now it's got me thinking lately about how my life is gonna go after that. I've been on this campus for 5 years and I don't feel ready to move on from it. I have a rough gameplan (look for internship -&gt; study/apply for grad school -&gt; grad school). Grad school is a must for my career choice, but what if this whole plan doesn't go well?

And lately I've been reading posts floating around on other threads about people asking for advice to their life problems and I keep thinking, ""How would I handle that situation if that were me?"". I feel so naive and behind on life experience. I don't know how to file taxes, I don't know how to manage or budget my money, I don't know how to start my career and make wages I can live off of, I've only had one real job at 22 last summer, I have no car, etc. It's come to a point where I get overwhelmed over just seeing or hearing ""adult vocab words"" as I like to call it. Words like itemize or subsidize or deductible, or what a car note and other words that school doesn't teach you about because I'm like, ""What the hell is all of this stuff?"". 

I see posts about 20 yr olds or guys my age who stress over their two jobs and not making enough money to make ends meet and shit and moving in with their bf's and gf's and in my head I'm like, ""So this is what I'm expected to experience at this age?""

Believe it or not, I even get scared to drive to certain places or distances because of my fear of driving but no adult thinks like that, right? 

There's a guy I like that I believe he likes me too. But he's much older and more experienced in life than I am and I feel that I won't be able to match up to him. I don't want to come across as immature to him but that's how my life could be described imo and I hate it. I don't like being labeled as immature and I don't wanna come across that way to other people.

Sorry I'm ranting at this point. I'm just feeling down and insecure over what little life/adult experience I've actually had. I want to be independent but I don't feel that way at all. I desperately want that experience and I want that feeling of being confident that I can take care of myself but I have no clue how to get it and I've felt really saddened  lately by all of this. Any help or advice you guys can give me?"
1358,Adulting help,"I'm a 25 year old woman who needs to get their shit together, and I don't know where to start. My girlfriend and I are very serious, and lately it's been brought to my attention that I'm not pulling my weight and I don't want to lose this amazing girl because of my own mistakes. I don't know how to budget, so I dig myself into financial holes but I'd really like to set up a savings account so that when things get tight they aren't ""barely struggling to fill up my car"" tight, and to be able to help pay bills on time so that she doesn't have to pick up the slack. I also would like to work on my temper as little things still seem to set me off (I broke a video game because it was taking waaaaay to long to load and idk what came over me but I snapped) and I don't want to be that person anymore. So I guess my point is, what are some things that I can do to work on my temper and maybe some insights on how to grow up and learn to budget. Thanks Reddit in advance!"
1362,Applying to college?,"I went through pretty much all of high school intending to skip college. I left and have been working as a jeweler for two years.

1367,I Want To Move Out.,"After I separated from my ex-wife last September, I had to move back in with my father for the second time in my life. I've also had to move back in with my mom once before. Aside from when I was married, I've only lived completely on my own once. All the other times it was with family or housemates. Now, it's been nearly a year and I haven't got shit to show for myself. I've been trying and failing to save up cash and pay off bills, but my depression and anxiety will have to take the blame for a few misguided purchases.

I have less than $10,000 of debt. I was able to pay off my car and get some things fixed on it, which did eat up some cash, however I still have loans and credit cards to rid myself of.

As mentioned, I'm struggling with depression and anxiety. Yes, I'm on meds and am seeing a psychologist, but I have no life outside of my job. I hate my job and I barely get enough sleep. I pretty much spend all my time alone and barely leave the apartment. I'm starting to feel more and more miserable. My confidence is shot to hell and I don't feel like a man who is almost 40.

It's by far time I move out, but as a wise man once said, ""The rent is too damn high!"" I make $13.35 an hour. We're working 50+ hours a week, so checks aren't too bad. Once the overtime ends, however, I will probably be at $2,100 a month. I don't want half my check going just to rent. I'm trying to figure out what I can manage, but I don't know what utilities will cost, let alone normal expenses. I was never good at finances and it's part of why I feel so helpless.

I've considered studio apartments, but I worry that getting one might make me look even more like a loser divorcee, not that any women are in my life. It's all a big pity party over here and I'm desperately trying to crawl out of this rut.

Any advice on figuring out money and is a studio apartment an direct ticket to Forever Alone land or a smart choice for someone hoping to one day move on with a special someone into a bigger home?

1374,"I want to grow up, but I am not sure how.","I am a 20 year old male. I am currently studying philosophy and primatology for my undergrad at a University in America. I have a job where I am working with animals. I am not in a romantic relationship. I am kind of weird, and I accept it. I got out of a weird relationship thing with a girl my age where she said I was too naive and didn't have much world experience. I really needed that a while back. This was back in february or march. 

I feel like I am so far behind my classmates. I mean gradewise I am all right, but that's not all life is. I am currently working with primates now, so I am working towards my goals. I am trying to start fully paying for my own apartment, but it's not easy doing 20 hours of classes and a job while making good grades. I am thinking of getting a second job, but my mom says I am pushing myself too hard. I just feel like my classmates are way ahead of me. They are off travelling to other countries and making new experiences and partying and all that stuff (I don't really want to party though).  Like my friend, for example she is out at disney world right now. She's also working with some chemical company. I feel so far behind. Another guy I know is now flying planes and doing things for the airforce. Another friend just landed a sweet job as an internet security programmer thing (way above my head). I'm just stuck here working and barely able to stay awake anymore. I don't know why I am struggling so hard.

 I feel like this is the age where I should start meeting girls and dating more, but it's not that easy to juggle. I tried juggling it last semester and my grades fell. Things don't seem this hard for others and I don't know where I am going wrong. I am not as close as I could be with grandmother. I asked her why I felt trapped in adolescence and she said I'll be an adult when I don't think things revolve around me all the time. I mean I know that's good advice, but that wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I don't want to be a burden on my family. I have scholarships, but my food, apartment, and schooling aren't completely paid for, so everytime I have to pick up that check from my grandmother I feel so ashamed of myself and like I am failing. I just don't know what to do and how to fix my life to be less of a burden on my family and where I am satisfied with myself. 

My philosophy professor told me that growing up is not a one step process and that it takes time, but I just don't feel like I am growing up at all. "
1377,How to go about fixing a car radio (Question),"First off, I know nothing about cars. Or AV. I've tried to research this and I just end up getting lost. I don't know if I need to replace my radio in my dash, or replace speakers, or get an amp, or get a sub. When I plug my phone (Galaxy S8) into AUX, my sound is significantly quieter than if I were just listening to the radio, which is why I want to upgrade my sound system. I've tried to mess with sound settings on my phone and on the radio, but nothing has worked. I drive a Kia Sportage, if that means anything. Any suggestions? I'm open to anything!"

1383,Tried to make black beans and underestimated the amount of time,"So ever since moving out, I have been relying on frozen food/purchased fast food to live but that's not really healthy or viable for long so I have been trying to learn how to cook. I did decent on making chicken breast (sauce was good, outer part was tender but the insides were dry) and rice is pretty easy so I tried to make a side of black beans to go with it.

Didn't really go well. I didn't know that you had to soak them overnight and I didn't know it would take so long for it to cook, it's been 3 hours since I've been cooking them and I haven't ate since 6 hours ago. I don't know whether to keep it going or to just stop and throw the beans out. "

1474,I'm new into college and my parents have basically taught me nothing.,"Literally. I am 19 and newly into college. I live on campus. I'm riding a full scholarship right now. I do not know how to drive, or cook, or manage finances, I've never been allowed to get a job. I'm sorry this is so open ended but it really is that bad. I am, in terms of self-sufficiency, a child.

1580,How to think twice before acting/speaking?,"Hello. I'm an 18 year old boy living in east Europe, and I just can't figure out how to think twice before doing anything. Sorry if this sounds insane.

I think of myself as a decent person. I deal with my shit and sometimes help others with theirs. Others tell me I'm smart but deep down I know I'm not. I can catch myself acting stupid. Doing childish things. I'm terrified of myself. I just want to act more like an adult. 

Sometimes, I do things without thinking twice. This wouldn't be an issue for me if it didn't impact others. But it does, it already did. Multiple times. I just feel like a moron. And I want to change. I really do. But I don't know how. I just wished I could slap myself hard enough to stop letting my sub-conscience deciding about my actions and power up my conscience.

I'm glad when others aren't paying attention to me and then ask ""what were you saying?"", because I've got another chance to think about whether to say it or not, and 50% of the times I reply: ""oh no. Nothing. Forget it.""

I just want to know, is there any way to start thinking before I act and speak? I'm tired of myself. Thanks"
1587,What do you do when you get tired of adulting?,"I've been fully independent from my family for 3 years now and I'm starting to get tired of all the decisions I have to keep making or else my life will fall apart. I have to keep thinking of what I'll eat for every meal + actually cook them and wash the dishes after, I have to follow a schedule of changing my sheets and my towels and cleaning the bathroom and mopping the floors, I have to worry about when I have to do laundry so I don't run out of fresh underwear. Aside from house stuff, of course I have to think about work and my future plans, and of course worry about my physical and mental health and how to pay for them. Am I making enough money to keep up my current lifestyle and still have enough savings and emergency money? Am I going the right direction, am I even going somewhere? Do I deserve to take a vacation? Can I stop caring about these things and not worry about the consequences just for a day? 

Some days it comes easy and natural and I don't mind it at all, some days I just wish I had someone with me to help me keep it all up. I sometimes get jealous of my friends who have hands-on or supportive parents, or those who have partners with whom they can share the burden with. I do have friends that help me out with big decisions when I get too indecisive or I don't know what I'm doing, and I know my family will always be willing to help, but I also know they have their own lives and worries they have to deal with. I've also been trying to find a mentor at work so at least someone can guide me with my career. But it just gets so tiring to have to constantly worry about everything at once.

1642,Finding public information? ??,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but couldn't find anywhere else this would fit either..

Is there a way to find someone's arrest records and marriage records online? My parents used to do it, but I don't know how and I don't have a way to ask them. Preferably free as I read a lot of reviews about giving sites your card info..   
I thought records like that were usually free, especially marriage records.

I cant find anything online though and I'd like to save a trip to the city hall if possible which is what I'm guessing would be my next move.

1665,Moving out,"As a 22 year old, naturally I would like to no longer be under my parents lengthy reign. Truly the only way to do that is to move out.
I've been weighing my options between having a roommate and living alone. Living alone would be a tight squeeze for now so I'm leaning towards a roommate but I'm super picky about who I live with because I don't need or want a roommate from hell story. 

Anyways that's not even the point- the point is that because I've lived with them so long the idea of ACTUALLY moving out is daunting. Like I can picture myself living by myself and the actual process doesn't worry me but theres a bigger, harder bridge to cross which is telling my parent's. My dad won't really care but my mom is different. We've talked about it before so she knows its something that's on my mind but having the ""I'm going to start looking at places and get ready to actually do it"" thing is giving my anxiety. 

At the end of the day I will do what I need to do but I don't know, any tips? I just don't want her scrutiny or anything. I've got this and that's all you need to know. Also me and my brother were going to just move in together but I just don't think he's ready. I've even recently told him I wanted to be our August/September but he didnt even say ANYTHING..like was that a no? And whenever I mention it he never seems excited and like it would be easier to do that at first but I can't wait for him to be ready for my own mental health sake. I don't know...advice? Is this even the right sub-reddit? lol"
1728,"In my early 20s, my life's about to start, and I'm scared!","If this is the wrong subreddit for this, I can delete it!

Grew up really repressed, isolated, off the grid, etc, etc. My family left my home country when I was young and I was always homeschooled (even doing university online), due to legal issues I could only ever get paid under the table or do online work which is what I'm doing now. All that is about to be behind me, I graduate school this year and am an adult who can go wherever she wants and I want to move back to the States! Problem is I have noooo clue how to do anything.

I don't know how to drive, how to pay taxes, where I'm going to live (the city where my most immediate family lives has a big discrimination problem :/), how to socialize, and I'll be starting over in essentially a brand new country right out of internet college. I'm excited but so so scared! Where do I start? What do I do?"
1747,How do you deal with living in an area with a lot of homeless people?,"I spend pretty much 24/7 downtown Toronto, since I live, work, and go to school in the area. If you've ever been here it's chaotic af, like every big city. 

My main problem is my emotional inability to deal with homeless people. I grew up in a household that put a lot of emphasis on equality (for lack of a better word) and empathy, to a point that if I see someone ""less fortunate than me"" I feel guilty if I don't give them anything, which is very toxic I know. When I first moved here I used to give change to some who asked but I really can't afford to do that at this point because you get asked a million times a day, plus a toonie doesn't solve their real problems. I regularly see people lying on the sidewalk, some wearing not enough to protect them from the cold weather. I work late sometimes and walking home at night I get asked for help by people who are cold and hungry and I can see how desperate they are but I can't do anything other than say sorry and walk away. 

Everyone wants to say we have resources to help homeless people, but there isn't enough. Most have mental health problems and even with a home it's hard to be self-sufficient and land on your feet when you have mental health issues now imagine trying to do that when you live on the streets. I have seen how easy it is for people to become homeless here. 

I have considered volunteering to lessen my own guilt but 1) I have very limited time with school and work and 2) I don't think the services that I could volunteer with really address the homelessness problem, they're more like a band-aid.

In general, things like homelessness, global warming, poverty, war, and all the other things that require government action and legislation change, make me feel so helpless because I have almost no trust in governments and who and what they really work for. I make monthly donations to Plan Canada and Amnesty International, I recycle and try to avoid companies that have been known for things like child labour and sweatshops (emphasis on try), but homelessness is the one thing that is in my face every single day and I just don't know how to deal with it. 

Sorry that this kind of turned into a vent post, I carry all of this in my brain every hour of every day and when I start it just all pours out. I'm already looking to start therapy so I can manage my emotions better, but until then any tips to deal with this would help. Thanks."
1750,One of my students asked me out.,"I am very proud of how I handled the situation.

I work at a university as admin.  It is technically allowed for me to date students, and being 25 I meet a lot of people my age at work.  However, I don't feel great about it.

He had made appointments just to ""chit chat"" with me, and made it really clear he was interested.  I was on grindr the other night and we started messaging.  He came on very strong.  With dating, I like a pursuit, a chase - he was basically just a horny monster (ah, to be 21).  But anyway, he was just trying to hook up, then it evolved into a date.  Plan was for last night - I cancelled.  Then tonight we were supposed to hang out and he decided he should come back to my place.  I thought it over last night, and this morning I sent him a text that I just wasn't comfortable dating or hooking up with a student.  He was very understanding, it was fine (guys tend to get angry when I cancel things like this, I was worried).

I am very proud of how I handled the situation, though obviously in the future I won't even entertain the possibility.  Just difficult being my age, working at a college when so many students flirt with me and such.

At my last job, a student started flirting with me and one thing lead to another.  He told me if I didn't sleep with him, he would tell my boss I did all kinds of terrible things including harassing him, tampering with his records, etc.  Basically I was raped, and he made me spend the night and did all of this stuff - it was so exhausting, but I didn't know what to do.  Never again.

So, yeah,  Don't shit where you eat.  I work hard for my living and I love my career, I wouldn't let a cute guy mess that up.  Loads of friends I've known have dated students (PROFESSORS, mind you - strictly forbidden!)  I just can't.  No, thanks.  I don't know how I could look my dog in the eye.

Not sure what the point of this is, I just wanted to share what happened with someone."

1779,"Living alone for the first time: scared, sad, and lost. Advice please?","Tonight, I'm spending the first night alone in my new ground floor apartment in a not so good neighborhood where there have been a lot of home invasion robberies and assaults. I'm a skittish paranoid person in the best of circumstances and I'm used to living in a house with multiple siblings, pets, and friends or with multiple roommates and pets. Tonight it will just be me and my cat alone. My rent is very high and I can't afford much in the way of groceries. My fridge is empty and I don't know what to buy. I haven't even unpacked. I just feel like crying. I've never felt so alone. I'm scared something will happen to me and no one will find out until my cat has eaten my corpse and starved to death. I don't understand how people live alone. It feels so empty here. I feel like I'm stranded on a deserted island. I wasn't expecting to be so sad. I was excited when I got my furniture but now I can't even bring myself to unpack my stuff. The prospect of sleeping alone here terrifies me. It makes me wish I had a roommate or boyfriend or girlfriend to share this place with me."
1795,Going to my first housewarming party of a friend and her roommate's. How much to spend on a gift?,"This is in Toronto, Canada. I'm going to buy alcohol. I don't know what's ""safe"" in terms of number of bottles and cost. Some alcohol will be provided but BYOB is strongly encouraged if you want to drink. I can still make a gift out of alcohol right? My friend has 11 confirmed guests on her side. I don't know about the roommate."
1798,Is it normal to ask for bank account info in a rental application?,"I'm applying to rent an apartment. It's being handled through a realty trust and they gave me an application packet to fill out. It asks for the usual stuff (rent history, references, pay stubs) but this one asks for all of my bank account numbers, credit card accounts, loans and my SSN. I've moved around apartments a few times before and I've never seen them ask for this much. Is this normal? Is it even legal? 

They also want me to mail it and I am so uncomfortable with giving them pretty much all of my personal information. I really like the apartment but I don't know if I should do it."
1826,How to go about this professionally without disregarding my emotions,"Okay, so I've basically been interning at this place for about a year. I have applied to three different positions that opened up in that time. Two of them I knew were a stretch, so while it wasn't exactly easy to keep showing up watching someone else in a job I wanted, I could at least accept it quietly and move on without any hard feelings. The people hired in those positions are genuinely qualified and good at what they do. Recently however I was more than qualified for a position. I made it past two rounds of interviews and according to my supervisor was on the short list. I did not get the job however as apparently someone else was more qualified. 

Here's my problem. I'm having a hard time accepting that since like I said, I've been there for a year. I have a bachelors in the exact field we're in when the job only required an AA in anything. I know the people, the job, and regularly already do things that would be required. Is there something I'm missing that this other person has? 

They also took three weeks before telling me anything. I only know now because I asked if there was any update. My supervisor said I interviewed really well, but they just had so many qualified people apply and this has never happened or been so close. She also said I may still have a chance if whoever they offered the position to does not pass the background check.  This kinda implies they offered it to someone external, since everyone internally, including myself, has already passed this check. I'm not holding my breath as I doubt I would be even their second choice, but that could be my hurt pride talking. 

I'm really upset. I was already taking the rest of this week off (it's my birthday) so thankfully I have some time away to process, but I'm really hurt. I don't understand how someone else could be more qualified. It's really hard not to take this personally, which I know is silly, but I can't help but feel taken advantage of. This was an entry level position and everyone there knows how I want to get started in this career. I don't know how to move forward in a professional manner, especially since I'm still trying to get my start in this field. 

I really just want to burn this bridge since I feel like my time and effort there have been for nothing. I don't want to be stupid however. But I just have a hard time believing if someone else was so spectacularly qualified it took them three weeks to decide, or maybe more accurately tell me since waiting on the results of a background check suggests they extended an offer already. I'm currently not paid while this position is a full blown hourly with benefits job so I'm not sure how that ways into things. 

Basically should I walk away, or attempt to keep going? I'm not sure I can stand literally working next to someone in a position I so desperately wanted and was definitely qualified for. 

Also apologies if I sound a bit bitter. This news is still fresh and I just want advice about how to keep moving forward in a mature adult way."
1841,How do I buy a car?,"My dad got me my first beater from a junkyard about 4 or 5 years ago for 1 thousand bucks.

Anyway, the car still functions but it's about that time a be a grown man and ask the internet for help. 

I'd like to get a used car but I don't know what to look out for exactly. Do I trust owners that are selling theirs and hope everything is legit after purchase? I know car-fax is a thing, butt still. Do I trust a dealership, or are they going to try and upsell me?

1893,How Should I be Getting My News?,"For years I've pretty much ignored current events, but I'm a grown ass adult now and it's time I start actively trying to keep myself informed. The problem is that I don't know where I should be sourcing my news from. I don't have time to be evaluating every source and double checking every fact, but if you aren't doing that, it seems like you can't trust anyone's story. I have sort of always felt like good journalism doesn't actually exist, it's like the tooth fairy. We like to believe in it, but the reality is that it's not real, and that's a big part of why I didn't even bother with news for so much of my life, but I can't just keep living in the dark forever. I get that completely unbiased information is impossible, but how should I keep myself up to date with the happenings of the world in a responsible way? Every news outlet seems to be either sucking Donald Trump's dick, or misrepresenting things, or obsessing over things that don't matter in the slightest, or up to some bizarre agenda.

I'm not asking specifically where I should be getting my news, but how I should be getting it and what I should be watching out for. I think getting it from multiple sources is probably a good idea, but again I don't have infinite time and I need a way to get good information without needing to spend 3 hours scrutinizing and cross-referencing it. News based subreddits seem promising, but they have had plenty of instances of things blowing up there and then turning out to be completely untrue. How do you all get your news, and how should I be getting mine? I live in the US by the way."

1978,Is there a way to moveout without a job?,"Is there any possible way to move out of your parent's house without having a job first? Im 18 and mine literally won't let me get one, but staying here is seriously damaging my mental health to the point where I feel like I want to die literally everyday. Feeling like life has been passing me by since I was very young. Ive been kept isolated since I first started middle school, so I don't have any friends to move in with for a few weeks. I feel like Im a hard worker, I do chores and cook quite often. In fact thats all I do. So Id do good at a job. I just don't know where to start since I have no connections or money or anything. And I dont want to end up homeless or in a dangerous situation of course. Any advice?"
2000,Do all adults end up feeling this way about their parents?,"I worry about my mom dying all the time.

I'm looking at pictures of her when she was young and she was so beautiful, and sometimes that's the version of her I remember, from when I was really young and we openly loved each other a lot and she didn't piss me off every 5 seconds.  

I look at her now and I barely recognize her, I try to talk to her now and it's like talking to an annoying stranger with expectations that I'll never meet and anxieties she projects onto me. In a way it feels like the mother I loved is already gone. I don't know if this is normal, if that's how all adults feel as they grow older, move away, and ultimately grow distant from their parents. 

I want to be closer to her, like I was as a child, but we're both such different people now with nothing in common, no common ground. I know she loves me but it's almost as if she loved me more as a small child, before I developed a personality. Once that happened, she has always wanted to change me into something else. In my teenage years we clashed a lot, but were still close since I still lived in her house.

For context, I moved out at 18, I'm 27 now.

2136,"My life is being upended and I'm being forced to move from New York to Atlanta very quickly, leaving all kinds of issues.","Hey y'all. This seems like a place to collect my thoughts about the insanity that has been this last week, and maybe get some feedback.

I'm in an intense grad program that includes a regular internship component. The grad program is in New York City; the internship is in Atlanta. The normal arrangement would be to fly between the two. As of just a couple of weeks ago, I've been told that because of the pandemic I can no longer fly to the internship - I can only take a private car. So my choices were to give up my (very prestigious) internship or, knowing that my grad program would be essentially online for the foreseeable future anyway, move to Atlanta. I chose option B.

So now I have to be moved from my apartment in New York City to Atlanta by September 1. In the meantime I have all these difficult little issues dangling in front of me and I'm trying to sort them out. Here are the big three:

1. My lease in New York City. It was set to expire August 31 of 2021. I've emailed my landlord and explained that I'm being relocated and I'm willing to do anything he thinks is appropriate to help him find a new tenant or sublet. He's a really good guy, I've been a favorite tenant, so I think this'll work out; not to mention that I think the extenuating circumstances forcing me to move offer me some theoretical legal defense if he decides to flip and come after me for rent or something. But I honestly don't know. Pandemic Law is a pretty new field.
2. Finding somewhere to live in Atlanta. Whether I should live alone or with roommates and where and how to find a place (especially considering the added questions and red flags raised by effectively bailing on my current landlord). That question is further complicated by the uncertainty of the grad program itself - I don't know if classes will be online for six months (100% chance) or a year (I'd say prolly a 90% chance) or two years (I'd say more like a 30/40% chance). It seems like committing to a year would be the safest option, but I can also envision being royally screwed if the grad program does open up and I have to come back to physically take classes again in the spring. Speaking of which . . .
3. My stuff. I have tons of books and furniture. Do I hire movers and bring it all with me? Do I put it in storage? What happens if I spend thousands of dollars moving my stuff across the country only to be called back in six months or a year? What happens if I put most of my stuff in storage and pay a monthly storage fee only to learn that classes are staying online indefinitely?

Ok thanks. Glad I got all that out. I welcome thoughts. I'm just a little unsure of a lot of stuff right now."
2162,What should I do if I want to move out by the time I'm 18? Quarantine has been making me feel hopeless.,"I've been stuck with no one but my narcissist parents for the past few months. I don't have a door, I'm constantly on edge and the stress has been making my health worse and worse. I miss school. I don't think I'll ever get out.

I'm a year younger than everyone else in my grade, and I just feel so behind.

I didn't get a permit when I could (This was just pure laziness, and that procrastination is my biggest regret.) I emailed the place, and there was supposed to be a response in 5-10 days, but it's been a few months. I checked again, and the wait time is now 4 weeks because so many other people are trying to apply for a learner's permit.

I can't take the online classes without a learner's permit, and I can't sign up for in-person classes until December, and the classes happen in the Summer of 2021.

If I wanted a job now, I would have to get a work permit, and since I won't need one in 2 months I won't bother. I downloaded Snagajob and LinkedIn, and I'm working on writing a resume, but I'm doubtful.
I don't think I'll be able to get a job until I'm 16. I don't even think I'll be able to get a job at all considering the current circumstances.

I want to make money through my hobbies, and my favorite thing is art. I want to sell my art on Redbubble, but go figure, you can't make an account until you're 16. In the meantime I made an art Instagram, and it's been failing miserably.
I read that in order to sell your art online, you need a PayPal Account, which you can't make until you're an adult. 

I also want to sell my old stuff (ie, old clothes, toys, etc.) online. but I don't even know where to start. How would I ship things to people, do I just give people things in person? That doesn't seem safe.

I keep seeing all of my old friends/classmates on social media going to work and driving, getting out of the house, and hell, being comfortable in their houses to begin with. And I'm not gonna lie, I'm really, really jealous.

I want to leave as soon as possible. But I don't know where to start."
2168,Making plans to move out of my parents house - Any advice is welcome," Some context. sorry for any typos

I am 23 years old, I am a student already soon to finish my degree in information systems, although I am not a good programmer, I love creating web pages and logos, I have a part-time job selling appliances and computers and I pay for my own car, cell phone, gasoline, university materials and I even bought my food, I have credit score (FICO 765+) and I just paid off my credit card debts.

My family is a little conservative on my mother's part and in general I don't talk about my private things to my parents since they just don't know how to express themselves (scream/overreact) or ask a lot of question (They want to many details). My family is difficult to manage and sometimes I have to do their paperwork or tell them what to do (adult things) and during the quarantine I realized that I cannot work remotely in the future or just take classes because they interrupt too much or they scream (to me or to each other) or complain that I am in the room all day (I like my privacy and everything is in my room, desk, computer, console, bed, ect), My family is always in an emotional or economic situation and they never manage to get out of it, the decisions they make sometimes have no logic.

My only assets are my car (Loan, $251/m paid in full by FEB 2022), 6k in savings and some stocks worth around $800.

Do I accelerate my plans to moveout or do I wait to earn more to leave more comfortable? any other advice?

2171,"Looking for apartments, how to juggle multiple room search?","Hi all! I'm moving to an area with relatively high rents. The only places I could really afford are 3 or more bedrooms.

I've interviewed with a few people who have open rooms, but I think I'd like to try to talk with landlords/owners directly. The trouble is I don't know many people in the area, only know one other person who's interested in looking with me.

On the plus side, I have enough in savings to pay the first/last/security on even a 5 bed, and have good credit. It is a college town, but it's still uncertain whether school will be online or in person (I'm betting it will mostly be online).

I'm wondering how I should go about trying to talk with potential landlords and potential roommates? I was considering having myself &amp; my friend sign, and then using Craigslist to look for others. What's the best way to organize this?

2175,Just finished my first year at an art school and I don't think I want to continue. Need advice.,"Hi all,

I'm pretty clueless and don't have parents who went to college. I know how dumb this post may sound, but honestly, the sooner I'm real with myself, the more pain and problems I will save future me, yk? 

So, as the title says, I just finished my first year at an art school studying film making, and I'm not sure I want to continue. I really would like some advice. As I said, my parents did not go to college and don't know how to advise me. If there's another subreddit I should post in for advice please let me know. Also, I plan on calling my school to ask questions as well, not just reddit.

I'm 19 years old. Just finished my freshman year. I want to be a business major. I was between business and film, and I chose film. The art school I'm currently enrolled in offers ""Entrepreneurship"", ""Advertising and Marketing Communications"", and ""Direct Marketing"" as majors. 

My question is would it be a good idea to switch majors to one of the business majors being offered at the art school, and then transfer to a different college after a year (I don't want my degree to say it's from this school bc it's very well known to be an ART school. I just want a business degree. Also, this school is very expensive). 

Or, is it possible to apply to another college? With Covid, most colleges are online. Could I do an online degree for a year (Leave the art school. Save money. Not have to pay art school tuition for being in online school with covid.), then transfer to another school for the following year to be on campus?

I'll take any advice. Again, I knoww how clueless I sound. 

Thanks."
2193,How do I mail things from home?,"The only way I know how to mail things from home is to pay for priority flat rate, but I am sure there is a regular way.  I just don't know what it is.

2209,How do I actually study better?,"I assume this might not exactly fit on this sub but I couldn't think of many other places to put it. 

Basically what the title says. 

I like to study but I always feel like I do it wrong. I know it's not something you can do wrong really but yet I feel like it. 

What I tend to do is read the coursework, write down the main points, and that's it. But I think the main problem is that I usually don't actually _read_ it, more like skim through and never look at it again. And I want to be able to actually retain information, if that makes sense. 

And it especially is hard for subjects I dislike (math mainly). 

For subjects I like and do well in, I feel like I just get ahead of myself and breeze through them. And I do well, don't get me wrong, but I sometimes feel like I should still take notes, just in case.

I guess I moreso mean, how do I get myself into a mindset where I'm less cocky about the things I know well and less careless with the things I don't know much about?

It works but it feels like it should be a bit better"

And if you work hard to achieve something, they won't congratulate you or notice your hardwork since it's already implied that you should do great.

Now, as you have graduated from the university, these expectations live on. It's hard because no one knows how suffocating it is. You don't even know what to do after the college but then they expect that you already have you life planned out. All you have now is fear-- of what's ahead, of expectations, of failures... and they don't know about it."

Now that I'm in my early 30s, I'm increasingly finding myself attending business luncheons and dinners where food that isn't familiar to me might be served; therefore, I have decided to catch up on my food familiarity that I missed out on growing up.

My only problem: I don't know what specifically to eat, since I don't have an idea what else is out there. I have three categories that I want to approach, in this order: ingredients, combinations (2+ ingredients together) and preparations (combinations prepared different ways).

So last month I got my first prescription medication, and I went to the pharmacy, picked it up and gave them my phone number and it was great. (I'm not sure why they took my phone number, they asked for it in French and I'm still learning.) However, they also took the little prescription sheet my doctor gave me that was supposed to be for a years refill, and no other form of identification. All I have right now is the receipt from the pharmacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

Uh two main questions, how do I get my refill if they took my prescription? Like do I just pull up and be like ""heyo its me please give me my medicine."" Also, when do I give them my insurance card? I think my international student insurance covers like 80% of the cost, except last time they didn't ask for it and I didn't know if I was supposed to present it to them for a discount? Or is that not a thing?   

&amp;#x200B;

Im so sorry if this is hella basic, im just lost and confused and I need to pick up my shit by Monday, when it runs out. Also if it helps, I'm an international student in Canada; and I went to a Jean Coutu pharmacy.

2400,Constant doctors appointments have me down.,"Just wondering when it'll end and if anyone else goes through this--it all started last month with starting therapy (65 dollars a session, every week), which I desperately needed to do. After that I got a UTI, an allergic reaction that led to needing a steroid shot (thankfully urgent care too it seriously, last time I needed one I had to go four times in all to get adequate care) and then another UTI less than a month before the first. I take cranberry supplements, a multivitamin, I don't get good sleep or drink enough water but I'm working on it. I'm stressed about money and I think it's making my health (mental and physical) worse, which just leads back to the doc.

I'm currently sitting here awake five hours before my ten hour work shift starts because of extreme UTI pain, waiting for my pain meds to kick in so I can hopefully sleep a little tonight. I'm just frustrated. I'm worried I'll never get rid of doctor bills. I'm worried I'll never be healthy. I'm cutting back to therapy every two weeks to help with my financial situation and I've resorted to Dr on demand but they said that I'll need a urine culture next time I get a UTI because obviously the first round of meds didn't cut it back enough for it to not come back. I don't know how much that'll cost. I'm so done with medical issues.

I'm sorry this post is kind of a rant; I feel like health issues and financial insecurity are just eating me alive right now. I don't know how to adult with those two riding my back constantly. Tips or advice is appreciate."

When I was hired I was under the impression I would have more responsibility and have more work to do and in the 6 months that I've been here I found I've mainly filed documents, wrote cover letters and send out fedex's. In addition to that, I haven't been able to become friendly with anyone I work with. I don't sit near anyone and no one in my department seems interested in starting a friendship.

2434,Tips for job adulting 101 20F,"Ok I don't know how to make this post serious responses only -this is like my third post or something-

Anyway:
So, I'm a key holder at my job and I just moved to the area realized (simply put) I'm not in Kansas anymore. I work in a gas station so you get some interesting people, or what are sometimes described as ""they're harmless"" meaning that dude is weird tried hitting on me told him no btw he's newly divorced no worries he's reallyyyyy socially out there but he won't do anything bad, compared to others. Now, I have coworkers closing at night that have to drive for 20 minutes to get someone to stop following them (they take 3 lefts so doesn't them, they turn off their engine so doesn't the follower, one girl got stalked home by a customer and hung outside her house (she is 2 years younger). My manager (who is awesome) has off handedly commented how she is ""scared to put me on nights"" apparently I'm the only one who doesn't mind getting up early and getting out when everyone else is waking up. 

My point: 
I love my coworkers, and my manager they are a real great group of people. But from customers I'm viewed as a ""damsel In distress, cute little thing, sweetie, etc."" Which I'm very much not so I'm just short and look like a well developed 15 year old people don't take me serious.

I'm struggling with the balance of customer service and laying my foot down. Outside of work is different I can lay my foot down if someone is an a** or creepy as heck, but at my job I can (where I'm at you have too) I just gotta do it with a smile.

2435,How do I(28M) have a fulfilling sex life while dealing depression that stems from rape?,"How do I responsibly find a sex partner while also working on dealing with depression/rape trauma, and moving out?

I don't think that I'm ready to work on attaining a typical relationship, as I'm still living with my parents, not financially stable, and I'm working on managing my depression which mostly stems from rape. I can't imagine finding someone in the dating scene who is willing to deal with that. 

I don't just want to ""get off"", I want to get to know myself when it comes to sex. I don't want to do that with a prostitute nor some random person I found online for a hook up.

This seems like an impossible situation right now, but I'm sure I'll be able to handle it. I just don't know where to start.
"
2440,Don't think I'm getting a good deal living with my parents financially. Now what?,"I'll try to be brief in summarizing my financial situation with my parents:

\- Parents won't make a budget (dad wants to but he never actually does and mom doesn't want to)

\- Dad calculated monthly expenses at this house to be about $3500 a month (A lot of that isn't even necessary- it includes stuff like fast food and both of their tobacco), probably a little more now that we have car payments because the cars they paid off both broke down and they got a new one

\- Dad only works on weekends and mom only works on weekdays babysitting for family (she doesn't make very much from this because it's family and she barely asks for any- she has another job she sometimes does on weekends that pays better but she doesn't do it very often) 

\- I have a full-time job and make more than both of my parents combined (I make about $2400 a month while they only both make about $800 a month)

\- I have two very expensive hobbies: gaming and figure skating, and I like to put most of my money in savings. I've made it a hard and fast rule that they can't have my savings because those are mine and mine alone.

\- It was initially calculated that I would give them $1,000 per month to cover expenses. 

\- They abandoned that idea and went back to just waiting until the last minute and then springing it on me that they need money

\- I made my checking account when I was 16 so it's still connected to my mom's account so she can get money from it whenever

\- I requested that at the very least I be assigned some bills- such as the electric, phones and Internet, or something like that- so I would have consistency. They rejected this idea.

\- Dad even sometimes accuses me of not contributing (I do, but it's not consistent or of my own accord, they just spring it on me) 

\- One time, parents demanded money from my savings (they said I'd be getting paid the next day so I could just put it back. I gave in and gave it to them, but that's not the point at all! I told them they couldn't have my savings but they demanded I give it to them anyway.)

\- I haven't kept a ledger of the money they took from me, but I really should so that they can't tell me I don't contribute.

Furthermore, my parents tell me the money they ask of me for bills is just a drop in the bucket compared to what I'd have to pay even living with a roommate, and that roommates are extremely unreliable and will leave me. I asked people at work and they said that the amount we agreed on is too much, and that it's not right for them to spring it on me- if they need money they should just consistently ask for it at the same time each month like how an apartment would with bills. Someone even told me that they're just using me for my money. I feel like that's true. 

I would like to try and live on my own so I won't have to deal with this, but I'm afraid my parents might be right, that even living with a roommate (even splitting the rent of a decent apartment with a rent of like 7 or 800 per month) would cost way over $1,000 a month with groceries and whatnot. That might be a moot point, because I don't even have any friends in real life I could ask to be my roommate right now. I don't know how to find roommates- though there are loads of college students here, so there are probably plenty of people looking for roommates.

But the only issue is transportation. I don't know how to drive (my parents either haven't wanted to or couldn't teach me how- though my mom is occasionally bringing up taking me out to an empty parking lot so she or my brother could teach me how) and the city bus doesn't go out to where I work. (It doesn't even drop off anywhere within walking distance, I'd still have to walk like 2 miles and I don't know what I'd do about when I get off at night.) I don't want to leave that job because it pays very well, I like it, and it's a great lead into my future career (I'm planning on doing a vocational career, such as welding or carpentry. I'm trying to save up enough to take welding classes.)

**Tl;dr:** My financially irresponsible parents ask for money very inconsistently. Were they to be consistent the amount would be $1,000 per month. I feel like my expenses might be lower living out of the house with a roommate. However, I don't know any roommate candidates, and furthermore my parents are trying to dissuade me from doing that, telling me it'll take years before I have the money to live on my own. What are the first steps I should take in getting my own place?"

Then there's my department. We maintain data for the old company, but that data is being integrated into the new company's system. The old system will be obsolete in April. The new company has said from the start that they don't plan to get rid of us, but they don't know what to do with us after April.

The new company still hasn't told us their plans for us and is getting less willing to even discuss them. There's no guarantee I'll lose my job, but there's no guarantee I'll have one or be offered severance. To make things worse, I'm having a baby in May and will lose all my benefits if I lose my job. My husband works, but it's not enough to support three people.

So should I stick with my current job and hope for the best or look for a new one?"
2624,"I think I'm ready to move out, but some things are weighing on my mind","Thank you in advance to anyone willing to read this wall of text. If you know a better subreddit to post for advice on this, let me know! Anyways:

After a few great visits to Philly, I'm beginning to seriously consider moving out there. I have a friend from college currently at Temple for Dentistry, and a cousin who I'm pretty close with working/living in the city. I think I've successfully infiltrated his friend group, and I met a girl out on my own during my last visit, so I have a little bit of a network already hahah.

**My Situation:**
I went to college in upstate NY, earned a B.S. in IT, moved back home (north jersey) almost two years ago and ended up finding work outside of my field of study and just kind of got stuck in the job. I hate it, pay is not impressive at all (about 32k/year after taxes) but I'm pretty minimalist so I've been able to save, solid benefits. Honestly I didn't know what the heck I wanted to do with my life after college so my time at this job gave me time to think and figure it out a little bit. Now that I have an idea though, I'm itching to get out of this job and get started on building that life.

**Reasons to Move:**
Honestly there's nothing really wrong with my home life. I don't have a good relationship with my brother but we stay out of each others' way. My mom and I are close, and my dad and I get along pretty well 90% of the time. They know I'm safe/responsible when I go out so they let me do my thing without any rules/interference. I just feel like it's time to take the next step in life and take full control. I like where I live, but it just feels a little stale. I tend to get restless when I'm in the same place for too long. Not to mention rent is crazy in North Jersey, so it wouldn't make sense/be worth it to move out to somewhere local. Furthermore, I'm ready to quit my job, but I wouldn't want to get a new job in an area that I'm not happy with and end up quitting again in order to move. I've only been at this first job for a year and a half, so doing that would look bad on my resume.

So onto my concerns.

**The Financial:**
How much did you guys have saved up when you moved out?  Right now, I've got about 10k in the bank, 4k in a 401k (3.5k vested, so I'd lose a bit if I left my job), fully paid off car worth maybe 8-9k, 11k in student loans. I pay about $500/mo into my student loans, $80ish a month for my phone plan, $150/mo for car insurance (under my mom's plan, it will be a good bit more if I move out based on the quotes I looked at before purchasing since I'm young). From what I've seen, I think I could get a decent (decent for 22 y/o man with low standards) 1br in the city for around $700-1000, or a less than decent place for a bit less. Credit score is around 750. I feel pretty good about where I'm at, but I know it's a lot different when you're out on your own. Do you think I would be able to secure a lease with my standing? I'm young and I'd be a first time renter obviously, so I know I'd be seen as a risk either way.

**The Guilt:**
How did you deal with the guilt you felt (if you felt it) moving away from home? I know my mom would be upset. I'm not all that close with my dad, but he is sick. He doesn't require anyone to take care of him, but it could come to that sooner than later. They're both getting older, and I feel almost selfish for wanting to leave. I love my parents, but I think I'm at that point where I'm ready to experience life on my own terms. I don't think that's unreasonable, but I don't know. Hard to say it isn't selfish. My brother lives at home, but he's kind of a fuck-up for lack of a better term. He causes more trouble than good for both of my parents, so that's another thing to be concerned about. Thoughts?


**TLDR**
Recent college grad feeling the itch to spread wings and ffflllyyyyyyyyyyyy on to new city and new life. Decent (I think) financial standing, but guilt about ""abandoning"" parents. What do"
2625,What to do about a creeping internet bill?,"So I've had this ISP for going on two years. I don't have any other options in my area, so I can't just switch providers. My husband also uses it for school and it's our one source of entertainment, so I'd rather not disconnect it.

Anyway, when I first started the service I was told by the phone rep that my bill would be right around $70 after all the fees and everything. My first bill comes and it's about $83... completely not what I was told. So I call and the next rep is clearly aggravated with me asking what happened to my billing and refuses to do anything. Repeat this process about 5 or 6 times until now and my bill is just short of $100. There's always something under the fees creeping and I honestly don't understand why and no one wants to tell me why a service I was promised was to be $70/month is now easily $100/month with no end to the bill creeping in sight. They force me to have a landline I don't use and can't disconnect with the DSL service as well. 

Downgrading the speed to save money only saves about $10 and is a huge drop for what we use the network for. And this is despite being promised a price I have NEVER gotten, not even promotionally.

I really don't know what to do."
2741,Need help on how to get vehicle out of my name with nothing but plate.,"
Ok so this is for my first owned vehicle when I was 19 and didn't know shit about purchasing, registering, selling cars, etc. I now have this car under my name that has been accruing interest in overdue taxes for about 3 years and all I have is the Plate number.

I had sold the car to my ex mother in law but never got my plates back or took it out of my name. The point was that I would let her keep it in my name until she was able to register it in her own. Long story short the car was totaled before it got to that point. (Thankfully that case was dropped or I'd have a lot more to worry about). Anyway, the car was junked from the wreckage site, I never knew where that was, and I don't know where it was junked either. Just know that I was somewhere in south western CT which is my home state. I know that in order to stop the taxes from building up i need to bring proof that the car was junked before the date the taxes were imposed. What I need to know is how I can get that information with only a plate number. 

Tl;Dr - Need proof vehicle was junked/totaled. Only have Plate number and vehicle year/make/model.

Any help would be very much appreciated!

Edit: Not sure if I'm in the right place but if I'm not and someone could direct me I'd appreciate that too :)"
2753,"How do I avoid bedbug infestation when buying a couch from a thrift store? (More generally, what do I need to know when buying furniture from a thrift store?)","Of course, as soon as I buy a crappy futon from IKEA, really nice looking couches pop up for like $70.

But I'm worried about bed bugs. I buy clothes from thrift stores pretty often but I'm not as worried about getting infested because I can wash clothes. A couch, on the other hand, seems like more of a risk because I've yet to see a washing machine that fits an entire sofa.

I live in an apartment, so I have no garage to quarantine the couch in. I don't have a steamer, and I don't know if you can even steam a leather couch. Are there pesticides that work on bedbugs? Do I need to rent a storage unit for a month?

---- 

EDIT:

Well, I guess that's a moot point. I asked on Facebook and the universal consensus is ""don't buy furniture from thrift stores"". One of my friends, who is an expert at thrift store shopping, said, and I quote: ""Even l won't buy furniture from a thrift store"".

So I guess I'll live with my crappy futon until I can afford a decent sofa, unless someone can suggest a source for used furniture that is less risky..."
2759,Relationship with my Mom and feeling of confinement,"22m. I'm studying a career and living with my mother and brother rn.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm caged all the time when I'm in my house. Most of the time, is about my mom and how we treat eachother.

I'm an adult, I take responsability of everything I do and try to be as independent as possible. I decided to work last year because of this, so I could give myself all my needs without asking for it, but last month droped my job because it was slowing down my career and not paying enought to start living by myself.

My mom... let's say she's responsible, but doesn't think or worry too much about things unless they're extremely important or has anything to do about her. She tries to help or do some chores, but many times she messes up or do things without thinking trough them and ends up angry, frustrated and agitated, and because of that starts acting like nobody exists except her and doing everything fast and blaming everyone for not helping her.

Also, my house is pretty small and my room is tiny. I'm used to that but whenever I sit or lay in my room to relax she just goes straight in without saying anything (I usually leave my door open), and stays there just watching me, until she makes up ANY question that comes up to her mind even if it don't make any sense, or comes by just to offer something. This happens every hour or half an hour as long as I'm in my room. My brother does exactly the same thing but just peeks, says nothing and goes away.

She also asks a lot about my life and my brother's life. Asking everyday 'What are your plans tomorrow? How are your classes going? Do you have to study? Do you have any exams soon?' Or when I go to hang out with my friend she's always asking who was I meeting, what I was doing, etc. Also she usually bring up questions about things that feel more like a critic to me and my image, like why I'm wearing a certain clothe or why I don't shave (I love my beard btw).

I also feel sick when I'm home, I can't focus on anywhing other than playing a game or watching a video. I feel fatigue all day long, and some days I get migraines or shortness of breath like I had a strong alergy. I oversleep a lot even if I don't want to.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel stalked, I have 0 privacy in my own home. I don't even dare to act like this with her, I respect her and she doesn't respect me. Is this wrong? She has the right to be this way just because she is my mom? 

I don't know how to talk to her about it. I alredy talked with her some times before and she stops stalking for a week and then starts being the same all over again. I need my space, but I don't have money or time to live by myself and do a career at the same time.

2768,I feel like a horrible person for not wanting to visit my dying grandmother,"I have a HUGE family. I am 30yrs old and have a very demanding job. I have always been the ""fav""grandchild because over the years I am the only one that calls or visits I have a lot of cousins and siblings. Grandparents moved to the other side of the country and the older I got the less time I've had to do anything. 

My grandmother is very sick and was given 1 month to live about a year ago. She has Alzheimers and gets angry and doesn't know who anyone is anymore. Of course I love her. But I can't lie and say I don't want to be a little selfish either and not go visit. (Feel like I can be honest on the internet)

I have had a few different consulting jobs over the past 10 years and haven't gotten ANY time off. Watching friends go on amazing trips Ive always been jealous and its running joke how I never have time off. I finally have a FT job and am about to take my first vaca with my fiance soon which is a pre-honeymoon and we are planning to get married in OCT this year so I'd need a few days then too (we haven't made it official so I can't really tell anyone). (I have seriously never had a single vacation in my life so this was a big deal for me) - My company gives me two weeks of vaca time and Im so burned out and exhausted for never having more than a 3 day weekend in forever. My fiance was livid when I mentioned that I may not have enough PTO to do our trip this year because every year I never have time off with my types of jobs and money is tight. We've been together 8 years and haven't even gone away for the weekend. 

I knew I'd have to take time off for my grandmother once she passes and to take time to help with getting the house across the country sold and getting my grandfather set up. So when my mom reached out to me saying to take off a few days I kinda freaked. I don't know how to say no, I don't want to go but I feel like a selfish ass. 

No one guilts my siblings or cousins about not visiting and im not even the oldest. Yet Im being guilted big time. Is it so horrible if I don't go? 

Maybe Im writing this because I need someone to be mean and call me out and tell me to suck it up or something but right now im torn because im not even a year into a new job and Im having a mental breakdown with not having a break. Visiting her is NOT a break. Its cleaning the house and cooking and to be honest, my mom doesn't work so she has the time to do this. I know family should come first, but she doesnt remember me. 

Idk does anyone have any advice. I know im being selfish but I guess just hearing from anyone would help. I asked a friend who told me to go, but this friend has also taken 4 weeks of vaca every year for many years and has no idea the level of burn out I feel. I've been messing up at work im so tired. Being selfish is so frowned upon. "
2800,What The Hell is Insurance and How Do I Get Some?,"I am 25 years old turning 26 in July and I have always heard that I will be taken off my parent's insurance once I reach 26. I just moved to a new city to live on my own last year and I'm trying to figure things out for myself.

Currently, I'm scrambling to book my own doctor and dentist appointments to take care of my hernias and wisdom teeth before my parents' insurance runs out. Luckily, I was able to use Aetna's website to find doctors that are covered by them. But now I'm hearing all these words like PPO, HMO, deductibles, and premiums and I am utterly lost.

What the hell is insurance anyway? To be honest, I only have a vague idea about how insurance really works and with all this back and forth about Universal Healthcare (or lack thereof) I really have no clue what the policies of this administration mean for me.

Can I even get insurance? Where do I start?

I know that sometimes you can get insurance via your work, but I work a non-traditional job. I work in film/tv in LA, and some jobs last a few days, while some last a few months (my last job was 7 months!). Often times, I'm unemployed. I keep getting mailers about health insurance when I work, but I just don't know what to do with them. Here in LA, the industry is run by about 3 different payroll companies and I get my checks from each of them depending on which payroll the studio is running. So, technically I don't even know who the hell I work for.

If you guys can help an aspiring adult with your knowledge on how the hell I should tackle this or point me to a place that I can call and get a consultation about my situation, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks."
2808,I'm Afraid to move out,"Hi, I'm a 23 year old male and I live with my mom and step dad. They didn't prepare me for the real world and ignored me for most of my childhood. I have no real world skills nor do I know how to socialize as an adult male. I don't have any friends or family to rely on, and in my current situation I'm stuck under their roof. My mother doesn't drive and my step dad never taught me how to drive, in fact he haven't taught me anything.

I'm often alienated and ridiculed by the members of my family for being the way I am, but they fail to realize that I never had nobody in my corner. I'm tired of being under their roof and want to be apart of society and operate as a normal adult; But I'm afraid to leave from under their care because I don't know anything or how to survive on my own. I'm dawning on an opportunity to potentially get a place of my own but I've been under their roof for so long, I don't think I'll survive by myself.

Any advice would be appreciated. I'm tired of this lifestyle, but I'm also afraid to leave it. Have anyone ever been in my shoes before? And is there any advice you can give me?

P.S. Since I don't know how to drive, alot of my food would be takeout. Hence, why I'm so afraid of being on my own."
2813,Should I take that last test for my diploma?,"So I never OFFICIALLY graduated on a technicality. I walked, had my party, went to awards night, the whole deal. My 9-10th grade high school accepted my advanced middle school math class as my algebra 1 credit. My 11-12th grade high school (I transferred districts in the middle) does NOT accept middle school credits for ANY form of high school credit, and so I don't have my state required algebra 1 credit.

I've completed 24 college credits, including the two classes required to take college calculus, and I took the first half of my alg1 credit during my time in high school.

I started taking my second alg1 class, but I hit 18, shit went south, and I had to choose between working to live or going to school. I chose surviving. I'm in a better place right now, currently applying for university and finishing a few community college credits.

For now, at least, no one wants to see my high school history because my college history speaks louder. But that single credit, potentially a single test, is looming over my head and I don't even know where to start. Do I go back to my high school? The district? Do I go over to the adult education building? Do I forget high school existed and go about my life?

2868,"I wasted 3 years of my life in college studying stuff I fundamentally don't want to pursue, and I don't know how to turn this around.","Hello. I'm a 20 year old living and studying in Portugal. I spent my spent 1 year studying Industrial Engineering &amp; Management because I had no idea what I wanted to do. After one year of not feeling challenged I turned to Physics and am now in my second year.


I royally f*ed up. I have excelled at sciences &amp; maths since I was a kid and so it felt natural to go down that path. I was also conditioned to think like that, be it from family &amp; professor pressure, or the general idea that ""engineering is what can give you a job"".  

I now realize that although I'm fascinated by the sciences, It is not something that fulfills me professionally.

I have always been a creative person, enjoying fantasy, books, drawing in all of my classes, thinking of other worlds and living my head. I am fascinated and have read some philosophy, sociology and psychology books, and would love to explore different aspects of these sciences in stories, be it writing screenplays, videogames, books or... something else.

Where do I turn to? I have 5k in the bank from saving my money, which pays 5 years of college in Portugal. I however cannot see myself working in any language that isn't English.

My current plan looks something like: work in the summer for more money, while finishing the physics minor. Apply for scholarships or alternatively student loans in an English speaking country for some area related to creative writing and go from there. 

However, I think I need a lot of input about these things, and while I've been trying to research these topics myself, some outside advice &amp; wisdom is much appreciated, considering how overwhelming and scary it is to do all this by myself. 

That's where this post comes in. Please, rip me apart. Tell me how stupid my plan is, all its flaws, better ways to do it or heck, discourage me from doing it. I need feedback on all that's been boiling in my brain. Be as blunt as you need to."

2900,"How to overcome the panic of tackling ""negative responsibilities""?","Hey!
I hope this is the right place for my question! Also,  I'm from Germany and I write this on my phone, so please excuse any grammatical or spelling errors!

I'm gonna be 21 in a few weeks and trying to get my life together right now. 

But I'm still really struggle when it comes to responsibilities that I know or convince myself will have a negative outcome for me. For example, once my boss called me in the morning and requested to speak to me in the afternoon. I immediately panicked because I assumed that she wanted to discuss something I did wrong. 

Throughout the morning, my fear grew bigger and bigger and when the time my boss asked me to be at her office arrived, my panic was so extreme that I just didn't go.
This happens more often than not, because I had and still have a lot of anxiety problems, but I can't always just ""run away"" from my responsibilities!

In these moments, I even know that this behavior will have bad consequences for me and can lead to even more stress or fear in the future, so it's not like I'm not aware of this.
But in these moments, I'm always just so overwhelmed by the fear of the negative outcome of this situation.

What's also a problem for me is talking about certain things or asking for something. 

For example, if my boss asks me if I can finish a report at the end of the day and at the moment I know I won't be able to finish the report, even if it's not my fault cause I may wait for some information of a coworker that's necessary for the report, I will probably tell him that I will finish the reality by the end of the day. 
I don't know why, but saying things that the other person don't want to hear is extremely difficult for me. I also have a hard time asking for help or for ""material"" things like refunds, even though I am entitled to get them.

So Tl;Dr: When there are responsibilities that could end bad for me, I panic and often end up avoid them, even though I know that this will have consequences. 
Also have a hard time telling unpleasant things and asking for certain things for me.

I'm not going to fucking Harvard or whatever, I'm going to a 200 person, tiny-ass school in Minneapolis called IPR so I can learn more about touring with some rock band doing their sound at concerts. Aforementioned tiny-ass school doesn't have any sort of housing because, you guessed it, they're a tiny-ass school, but it is pretty close to the college town for U of M.

Scholarships and parents have got tuition covered for me because I'm lucky as shit. I found a spot near the big U that'll give me my own bedroom in a 4 bed 2 bath college suite. It's $640/m, pretty much everything is included (heat, electric, gas, etc.), and it has its own laundry room and kitchen and all that shit. I know that I'm gonna need my parents to cosign for me bc I'm a minor but I have no fucking clue what that involves. I'm flying up there by myself next month, gonna talk to the school and the apartments and hopefully just have fun.

I'm also gonna try to get my medical shit worked out. I'm generally a pretty healthy guy, aside from a nut allergy and some stomach shit like reflux. I'll have my wisdom teeth taken care of before I go. But I really have no clue how hard it'll be if I get sick. I don't know if I'm supposed to see a pediatrician or a regular doctor, but my current pediatrician is supposed to help me find somebody. I'm pretty sure I can do shit like pick up prescriptions by myself.

I'm not gonna be bringing a car bc that shit's expensive. I've got an electric longboard that'll go 30 mph for 20 miles, and Minnesotans are weirdly obsessed with bike trails, so I'll be able to get places pretty easily, but I'm gonna get a student bus pass (yay discounts) for when weather is shit or I'm tired or whatever. 

TL;DR I'm working on figuring out housing and medical shit. Is there any glaringly obvious important shit that I don't have figured out? Do any of you have practice adulting as a minor?"
3075,OK this is weirder than it sounds... Problem with a light bulb.,"This post is a weird one and I hope this is a suitable sub cos I'm hoping the answer is I need help adulting and not to call a police officer. 

Okay so I am 29 and I cant recall a time I've ever changed a light bulb. This is highly embarrassing. Now, the problem is not changing the light bulb, I'm a big girl, I'm sure I can figure it out. The problem is, I don't know if I'm being paranoid or if someone is genuinely messing with me and not knowing enough about light bulbs, I can't tell which one it is.

I live with my husband but he is away for two weeks. 

I leave the hall light on every night. Never turn it off. This morning it was off. I touched the switch and nothing. I just assumed the bulb went. But, in the back of my mind, I had this feeling someone was messing with me. The last two nights I've just had a gut instinct someone was in my house when I was asleep. I even put stuff in front of the bedroom door so I'd hear it open. 

Yesterday morning a door was open that I'm sure I closed but maybe I didn't? Then, middle of last night, I went to the toilet and there was a kitchen towel in the middle of the floor like it had been knocked off. Could have fallen. But then this morning, the light was out. So I went to the bulb and touched it. It felt loose. I turned it and it came back on. So the bulb hadn't gone. But then It went off again. This is the problem. I don't know if I'm screwing it the wrong way, if I'm not screwing it enough, if a light bulb that has never been a problem before can just suddenly become loose over night.

Now, having never changed a bulb, I'm not sure if this just happens. If the bulb can just loosen. Or if someone has actually been in the house when I'm asleep. I don't know if I'm being paranoid or what. This isn't the first time that there has been weird stuff happen that makes me think someone has been in my house.

So someone who knows stuff about light bulbs, please tell me, can it just come loose or is it likely someone loosened it to mess with me? I'm losing my mind.

And I know this post is super weird but I swear it's not a shit post lol."
3080,I wanna grow a beard. Don't know how to start,"I am accustomed to having a goatee and mustache, and scruffing it out between haircuts. I only shave when I get a haircut as I have since I was a child.
Now, im  considering growing a beard but honestly...don't know how to go about it. I have about a months worth of scruff on my face which would probably look decent once tidied up but like....how do I tell this to my barber?
I don't shave at home nor do I trust myself enough to handle it on my own (I have tried to trim my goatee before and my mustache and just ended up a lopsisded mess).

Any advice here, love?"

3135,"20, lost, and no support system atm","So, for some context, I'm 20 with a survivor instinct. I have no father and no contact with any family. To be frank, the only one who gave a shit about me was my half brother, who is in prison. I'm moving to Nevada, from Kansas, with my brother's cousins to try and establish myself, but honestly have no goddamn clue on what to do with myself. I was a drug addict from the ages of 13-17, due to my abusive household and my foster care adjustments. I was pressured into college, which I ended dropping out in March, because I had no clue what the hell I was doing. I don't mean the class material just the set up and paperwork that went into like living there and whatnot. I grew up thinking it'd be a miracle if I graduated HS, then forced fed options I didnt know what to do with by the foster care. I legit don't know how to do anything with legal documentation other than having my driver's license and a bank account. With this move I don't know if it'll work out, but with my life I've learned not to assume so.  Somehow I've made it this far, I'm 90% sure I'm in collections with the university of kansas, and because of some financial issues I have to move as I mentioned. I'm pretty sure I have several medical issues. Where should I start? How do I get my life on track? How do I do simple shit like pay bills and whatnot?"
3155,Is wearing jeans to an interview ok?,I spent the last 5 years working in a factory so I don't really have any dress pants or slacks(?). I had one pair at one point but I can't find them anywhere so chances are I got rid of them during a clothing purge. I have an interview today and I have a shirt I would like to wear but the only pants I have to go with it are black skinny jeans. They're in good condition and look nice but I don't know if it will count against me if I wear them.
3178,Adulting hit me hard today and I badly need tips.,"Before I start, I want to apologize if my grammar isn't good as English is not my first language. 

I'm from the Philippines. Unlike other countries, it's not customary for us to move out when we turn 18. Some of us would rather stay home because moving out is way out of our comfort zone. I'm turning 25 this month and moved out two weeks ago. The first thing my dad said when I told him about my decision was ""Are you sure about this? Would you be able to do it?"" I was really confident. My paycheck can handle the expenses, I thought.

The first day, my boyfriend helped me out buy some of the necessities such as a dish rack, trash can, a mattress, etc. We planned to buy some of the other stuff on my next paycheck. I didn't have a stove for the last two weeks and lived off my boyfriend bringing me food or ordering fast food. 

This morning, I received my paycheck. I didn't get enough commission so I budgeted hard. I planned to have a couple of thousands left so I can save it for the next rent payment (which includes electric, water, and internet bill). So there we were, buying a stove good enough for me to cook for one instead of ordering again and again.

I really thought a new LPG would be really cheap. Of course I needed one to cook as the stove would be useless. When the lady told me it cost above 2k pesos, my knees started shaking. I panicked. Buying this would cut the budget short and I would be left with only 1k (excluding the rent payment saved). I almost cried. I wanted to call my dad and move back home.

Back in our apartment, I cried to my boyfriend. It was so stressful budgeting my own finances. I realized how much my parents went through. They needed to budget for three kids and a grandchild (my sister's). When I was living under their roof, I never really cared about expenses. Whenever I receive my paycheck, I buy shit I don't really need. ""Savings? Fuck that."" I used to say.

It hit me so hard today. But all was said and done, right? I already bought it. When I got home, I started doing chores like crazy. When I was back home, I never really did stuff. Now that I live alone, there's no one else to do this but me.

Honestly though, I want to give up. I don't know how you guys do it. I need some tips. It's been two weeks and I'm already thinking of giving up. I know I sound spoiled and that this wouldn be the first of many struggles. I badly need help.

TLDR- Moved out of parent's house feeling confident, two weeks later, I'm thinking of quitting and going back to the comfort of my own home. I need some tips with adulting."
3196,How do I get in to see a doctor?,"I've  started my first ""real"" job out of collage, and just recently got  insurance through my employer.  The issue I have is I have no idea what  to do or how to use it or where to go.  I moved out and moved away from  my parents and I unfortunately don't have a good relationship with them  so I am trying to figure all of this stuff out on my own but health  insurance and doctors is way over my head and nothing I have any  experience with.

I am dealing with  a hip injury for a past couple weeks and I want to get it looked at  because I don't know if it just a hip sprain or a small fracture in my  bone or something else serious.

I  would pay significantly more to go to the ER than if I was to get into  an appointment but in the past I have always gone to the ER."
3201,How do I become an adult?,"I'm 22 and the most adult-ish thing I done my whole life is go to a college other then that I'm still a child. I never have a job, don't know a thing about driving, still living with my parents, and I don't go out and socialize or create a network. I look around me and the people I went to school with have kids, jobs, cars, or house. I'm so far behind I never even order my own food. I want to start adulting but I don't know where to start. I need to learn how to drive to get a job and socialize but I need a job to pay for my classes to learn how to drive. Idk where to start adulting."
3208,When are water drops in need of wiping up? I always thought it was silly to worry over every drop of water because... it's water. It evaporates. But I'm questioning my philosophy as I see small examples here and there when it does actual damage.,"I now understand that water drops on carpet and walls make spots...  

But if a drop of water lands on another surface do I really need to stop what I'm doing and grab a kitchen towel to wipe it up?  

Around bathroom sink, in bathroom sink, around kitchen sink, in kitchen sink, on counter tops, on a table, on a chair, on vinyl linoleum, on tile, on the stove, in the fridge, on the surface of other random appliances like coffee makers or rice cookers...  

And what about on faucets?  They always get splashed when used... yet they seem to suffer the most from water accumulating around their base and on the fixture itself.  Are you really supposed to totally wipe down a faucet every time you use it?  

(Thanks for reading. I really don't know. I'm 38 and have lived in horrid conditions and am trying to learn how to live ""normally."")"
3220,Can I email my employer to ask how much I'd make?,"(I don't know if it is here where I should post this but this seems like an adult thing)

Silly question when taken out of context to allow me to explain:

I recently applied for a position at my college's library where I'm a student at. Due to my qualifications, they gave me the job that's above it, as a manager. The thing is, they told me I'd have much more responsibilities and a higher pay grade, however when I asked them what the difference between the two jobs was (both pay-wise and activities-wise), we ended up focusing on the activities I'd do, rather than how much more I'd make.

Would it be okay if I emailed them and asked how much more money I'd make? Or would that make me look bad? Do I pair it up with another question I might have or something?

This is my first 'formal' job so to say, so I really don't know what to do."
3231,"I'm 32, have two kids, and living with my parents with no clear career, nor income stream. I am an adult without having the merits to be one.",Exactly as the title says. Anyone else in their 30's around here?? I don't know how I've fucked up so badly but I have two kids- one is 3 and another is 3 months old and I don't have a clear career nor career prospects nor income stream- I am essentially being given my income by my dad because he started a business to 1) keep himself busy and 2) provide an income for me. I feel and talk like a 14 year old with the mind of one while actually being 32 and in no place to actually be in the father/husband position I'm in. I think something is very wrong with me and I fucked up royally. What do I do. Why am I not an adult? What am I doing wrong??
3275,Any advice for someone who is drowning in dishes?,"This may be a silly question, but I appreciate the advice. 


I've spent years eating takeaway/prepackaged meals. I've recently starting cooking more for myself using fresh ingredients and healthier foods. It takes more time to cook, but I'm okay with that. 


The problem is that is causes So. Many. Dishes. I don't own a dishwasher, and I feel like I'm spending so much time in my day just washing dishes. I've tried washing after ever meal, and also piling them up and doing one wash at the end of the day. They both take up the same amount of time. I don't want to use paper or disposable products since they are bad for the environment. I don't know if I'm using too many dishes so here's an example of a typical day for me:


- Breakfast: pan for eggs, bowl for scrambling, plate for eating, blender for smoothie, cup for smoothie, cup for coffee, fork 

- Lunch: Tupperware for leftovers, Tupperware for salad, small Tupperware for dressing, fork, knife 

- Dinner: baking dish, roasting pan, bowl, plate, cutting board, knife, fork, water bottle 

- Snack: bowl, cutting board, knife, fork 


When I write it out it doesn't seem like a lot, but I feel like I'm spending so much of my time washing dishes. I guess it doesn't help that I'm out of the house from 7:30a - 6:30p each day so when I am home I just want to relax. 


Any advice on how I can make this less time consuming?"
3277,"First time engagement ring shopping, have zero clue whatsoever","I don't even know what to ask because I don't know anything about engagement rings. But here goes nothing:

I'm hoping to buy a pretty engagement ring that is within $1500USD, and before I started looking into it I thought it was as easy as walking into a jewellery store and picking one with the right size. However, after some research, it looks like a lot of people dissuade others from going to any ""major"" or chain jewellery stores, and they advise that you find an independent jeweller.

Given my budget, does it make sense to find an independent jeweller? Are the rings in major chain jeweller stores actually bad? I'm not looking for anything fancy or custom-made (those are probably way out of my budget anyways), but something pretty and simple.

Any pointers would be really appreciated!"
3280,I feel like I've forgotten how to play.,"As a kid, you'd get sent outside to play and you found shit to do to entertain yourself, but as I got older, as I fought my first round with depression it seems like I forgot *how* to play.  I go to a pool and just have no idea what to do. I see kids splashing about and having fun and I don't understand it. I go to an amusement park and it's boring. I go to the river and just sit idly in the water because I just don't know what else to do. I feel like there's something wrong with me like everyone can have fun except for me. It makes me want to cry sometimes, the feeling of missing out. Maybe it's just something that depression has permanently robbed from me or even more terrifying, maybe that's just being an adult.

I'm tipsy while writing this so it may just be doom and gloom thoughts...but it doesn't stop the reality that I don't know how to have fun without videogames or youtube or whatever other bull."

Mods: Sorry if this doesn't belong here, I'll remove the post if you want me to, thanks. :)

Male, 21/22 at the time, 24 now. From Denmark. During the time I was working as a night shift salesman at a gas station, always alone during my shifts. I worked one week on and then I had one week off. 

One night, a drunk and high guy walks in and wants to order some food, but is rude to me. I politely ask him to please speak properly/nicely to me. He refuses and continues being rude, I ask him again and add that he needs to leave the store if he continues again(we are allowed to). 

I can see the rage in his eyes and I can immediately tell by his posture, that he is going to try and throw a punch at me over the counter. I predict it coming and dodge it like som matrix shit. He becomes enraged and makes his way around the counter and charges me, I was very unprepared and unsure what to do, so I just protect my head with my arms all the while he goes to town, but I'm bigger than him and working out alot during that time, so it doesn't hurt as much as it could have.

Luckily my friend was in the store chilling with me and saw the whole ordeal, and after I ask loudly to my friend and the crowd of customers if ""I could get some help?"", My friend decides to help get this guy off of me.

The guy backs off and smashes some hardware on the way out, heils Hitler and yells anti-semitic slurs at me on his way out, which was wierd, because I'm not a member of the Hebrew. He also grabs a basket at the entrance and hurls it over the heads of the customers, who barely avoided it, towards me.

The police arrive after 45 minutes, takes notes and they recognise the guy, just by me describing his looks, they immediately know who it is. I report it to the police and I go to the hospital to get looked at(Law says I have to if I'm going to report him).

I was kind of in shock, just completely baffled by the situation that just occurred. I only got a few scratches and swelling on the side of my head.

I say to my boss at the time that I'm only going to need 1 day off, I had no idea that what I was subject to, was about to effect my mental health for months to come.

The days go by and during that time I gradually get more and more depressed. About 3 months after the incident, I quit my job because I don't feel I can do the job properly in accordance to what I think the job requires of me and what I can handle in my decaying mental state. 

I am bedridden for many months after, not doing anything, depressed. After 6 months I decide that I can't handle it anymore and seek psychological help, as I should have done much sooner. So about 9 months after I got assaulted, I seek help.

I get given a psychological diagnosis (skizotypi - basicly skizophrenia but without multiple personalities, I'm just me, but with psychotic ""tendencies"") and start treatment with medication and sessions with a councillor. I get better because of the medication and during a session I ACCIDENTALLY say I used to consume cannabis for a couple of years prior and various other drugs, and they began suspecting ""drug induced"" psychosis and noted it in my medical records even though I told them not to. And they listed it as abuse, even though I was never abusing substances. So the doctors didn't help me at all. As I suspect them writing it, may have been detrimental to my case. And I was experimenting with drugs and stopped again, way before me getting assaulted. But the doctors didn't note this down in my records.

I don't really trust the doctors and don't think the actual sessions help, only the medication. But I continue in the program for the medication and I gradually get better.
I go to court and say my testimony at the trial, he had priors for violence, done case.

Then I report the incident to my insurance and here is where I get even more unsure if I'm entitled to anything.

I only seek payment for the time where I'm was out of work, as I have since gotten much better, got work and going to school with straight A's as grades.

But to my detriment, the doctors have done a poor job of documenting my case during my treatment and never mentioned once in my notes from the treatment there, that the reason for seeking help was the assault. They also noted me talking about cannabis and drugs, even though I asked the doctors not to write it in my records.

And now I'm in the process of a second parts hearing, where the insurance is ready to make a decision and sent me all the material that the insurance company is going to use to judge my case, to make sure its right.

In the material, the insurance company also included a period from my youth(I was 15, when the following incident happened) where my parents have just gotten divorced during the final exams of what's equivalent to Americans middle school, by way more important here in DK. This caused me to overload with stress and try to ""kill myself"" as a scream for help with taking too many paracetamol and ibuprofen, even though it would have never killed me. This was also caused by that I never had any friends during the 9 year time of ""Groundschool""(as we call it) and I got bullied almost for the entirety of that 9 year period, by a large amount of my pupils.

The doctors during that time classified it as depression, but never gave me an actual diagnosis, as they have now. Never got given medication, but was offered it, never accepted medication for mental health issues before now.

I feel the material that have been presented to me by the insurance company lacks the context I'm describing above, as they have included my entire mental health record and a separate official note from my own doctor that states that I have been through this treatment and as far as I remember the note also says that my poor mental health state was caused by the assault I was subject to.

I'm not entirely certain about the last part, and other minor things like how long it was ago and how much time passed between the certain events. I would have made sure its right, but I'm on holiday and don't have the material in front of me, so I just go by memory, so forgive me if there's a lot of uncertainties. I'll be back on Monday/Tuesday, and will make sure then.

So, I'm uncertain if the material given to me is sufficient, if it lacks context, if it looks like I might get some form of compensation or anything in general about these cases, do I stand to gain some compensation or not. Do I need to write to the insurance company to give them more context about the matter or what.

I really hope I'm entitled to some form of compensation, as I have had some struggles during my life and I'm really doing my best to not let anything hold me back from being the successful person I want to be, and if I get compensation it would make life a lot easier for me, compared to how it has been.

Anyways, I'll appreciate any form of guidance, context, help or tips than you provide.

I'll do my best to answer any questions asap, as I'm on holiday and I'm trying to relax before starting my last year of school.

Thanks in advance! :)"
3302,I really want a dog or cat to fill this void of loneliness and emptiness but I can't get one until I move out. What option should I choose?,"I live with my parents, I moved out once to live with my bf at the time and we split up right before I could get a pet dog or cat. I was paying off debt and was so close to being ready but then I had to move back home after the chaos. Now I cant get a pet. I just turned 24 and I am having baby fever and the desire to take care of something. I really want a dog and I'm depressed that I got so close to getting once after 23 years of begging only to be deprived again.  I am really depressed right now because my ex and I were seeing each other again and now he is going away and I will be alone again. I dont have friends ti hang out with often. He was my only consistent person I had besides my family. So now I'm trying to prepare for the upcoming loneliness by trying to decide what to do about my dog wants. My parents hate pets. I have had a parakeet, fish, and hamsters, but they all bored me and I hated having to have them locked in cages as I thought it was cruel. 

My parents helped me come up with a budget. I'm not paying rent here. So that is a plus.  If I move out in October I could save $8,000 in 2 years. 
If I moved out in 2 years, that number could be $41,000. But then that's 2 years of my adult life gone. 2 years of no sex whenever, 2 years of having a curfew, 2 more years of driving 40 mins to work every day because my parents live far from my job. Heres my options which one should I pick?


Option 1: move out within a few months into an apartment, get a doggo, live my adult life

Option 2: stay with parents for 2 more years to save up for a house down payment, get a house, then move out and get a doggo. 

Obviously option 2 is better financially but with option 1, I have a chance to live my life to its fullest sooner and what if I die in 2 years and never got to have a dog because was trying to wait!? Wow that would suck. Also I get scared of option 2 because what if I meet a guy that I want to marry and I have a house and he put in no effort to earn it like I did.. you know? I kinda feel like getting a house is more of a couples thing but I don't know. What do you guys think? Or is there another mind of pet I can get for now to kill this baby fever?

3341,I feel like a immature manchild,"Hey, I am 23 years old. I spend my days studying chemistry at university and have a part time job as a nursing assistent, but I still live with my mom. I pay for most of my own stuff (food, bills, books, car etc.) but I don't pay any rent or anything. However, I just feel like a child sometimes. I can't keep my room tidy and it can get pretty messy sometimes. It is not that I can't clean, I do that everytime when I am at work. I never help with cleaning the rest of the house because I have no energy, the only thing I do for my mom is cook a few times a week. When I get home from the university or work, I commonly fall asleep instead of being productive. If I don't fall asleep, I kinda get obsessed with my hobbies like piano and learning languages that I feel like the time is better spent than cleaning. I don't know why I live like this. Maybe I am depressed... I don't know."
3381,living with a roommate raised completely different than me,"i grew up in a household where i was taught things that most people i've met typically know.
like hand towels are separate from rags which are separate from bath towels, etc.
i was talking to my roommate in the kitchen and i watched him start scrubbing the counters clean with the brush i use to clean the dishes. he will leave fruit rotting on the counter which collects flies and same with in the fridge drawers. 

i've watched him wash his face with not only the kitchen hand towels but the rags i use to clean the toilets. i explained why that's unpleasant and that he could do it if he wants but he didn't understand it still. these are a few of the simple things that happen.

he's told me before that he really wants to understand these things and that i have to tell him things like this so he understands. it's very clear it's frustrating to him that he can't wrap his head around it. 

i feel like it's not my responsibility to teach him and it's very draining. it also both stresses and grosses me out and i don't want to be throwing things away from this all of the time. however, i've always addressed the issues in a calm, validating manner which usually helps both of us.. just only for a couple weeks. 

i don't know how to ease the tension or frustrations in the household. it doesn't cause problems in our friendship (we are also best friends) it does make me feel bummed/stressed/upset that he can't function the way he wants to. 

he got really upset today and had a semi break down because of it.

I am still doing my Masters here in Germany and work part-time, because I don't get scholarship. I left my country without plans. I just want to leave the country. That's it. Now, I am panicking as it's not as easy as I thought. 

I only earn circa 600 to 700€ per month. And I currently live with my boyfriend and pay a little bit of sharing for the rent like 150€. And for grocery, I have 200€. So, everything is gone each month. No saving. No emergency saving etc. 

But, now he wants me to move out as he is not used to live together with someone else. I am his first real girlfriend. And he is overwhelmed by sharing space and having to take care of me so to say.

I want to finish my studies in a year, so I can look for a job.

3462,"How to, well, adult.","This is probably very vague and commonly asked, but how does one even *begin* to be an adult?
I am 19, but I'm still stuck with the mentality of like a 14 year old. I was homeschooled and I have next to no knowledge on adulting.
All I know is that I wanna save up money and buy parts for a gaming PC, but I'll need a job first.
I've never ever had a job before and I don't even know where to begin.
All I know is that I need an ID and a resume, but I don't know much about wages, hours, shifts, etc, and I don't know one thing about jobs that require certain things like a highschool diploma or whatnot.
There are too many questions I have to ask and my parents seem to think I just know everything when really I know nothing.
I'd like to just get a job where I am set in a room or something doing tedious work for hours with little human interaction, but turns out you need advanced paper things with government super master lords watching over your soul to go get a job in moving objects from point A to point B.

3476,First encounter with bread beetles,"So I moved out of home 3 years ago and I thought I'd p much figured it out by now. But I opened a tin of loose leaf tea I bought back on Halloween, only to find it crawling with small brown beetles.
Needless to say I was confused as fuck since I'd only used the tea once or twice since buying it so they'd have had to be in there when I bought it since it was an almost airtight tin. 
I'm kinda perplexed as to what to do, Google says just pick them out and carry on but I don't think that's possible cos there's so much tea in the tin.
I don't know if it would help but I'm going to take it back to the shop where I bought it since I'm on first name basis with them just to let them know in case there's an issue with their supplier.
It's a shame cos it was a limited edition Halloween flavour and it was my fave out of all the ones I have right now 
But yeah, it was a surprise to say the least."
3510,How to manage sleepwalking/hallucinations?,"I have had this issue for a long time.  I'm 25 years old.  When I was very young I had night terrors, and I would wake up and thought I saw rats and spiders in my closet, and I would go and wake up my mother about it.  In undergrad I had to be given a private dorm room, because I would get up in the middle of the night and go through my roommate's things - with no memory of this at all.  When my mom's abusive boyfriend killed himself I would wake up and think he was talking to me, or standing in the room - that was horrible and terrifying.

My boyfriend is about to move in with me.  Apparently I wake him up in the middle of the night about once a week pointing at nothing and talking nonsense - the first time it really startled him because he thought there was an intruder in the apartment.  Last night I slept on my own at my apartment, and I woke up in the middle of the night thinking my boyfriend had snuck in - I thought he was under the bed and I was freaking out and talking to him.  I got up and turned on the light, only to realize he wasn't there.

This is happening a lot again.  It's impacting my sleep quality, and I'm afraid that when my boyfriend is all moved in, it will become a problem for us.  I don't know how to begin addressing it - I went to therapy when I was little to stop the night terrors, which seemed to work well enough.

Sometimes I remember and am more awake than asleep, and I have visions.  Sometimes I do or say things when I'm asleep and have absolutely no memory of it the next day, and only hear about it from others."
3523,Tricky Life/Work/Moving Situation - Am I Missing Something?,"hey /r/adulting!

i'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and i want to see if someone has advice or options i'm not aware of/am missing out on.

i'm a 22 year old that just moved back to california from oregon to be with my family again. i'm living with my parents, and i HAD a solid job (dream job, even!) through a temp agency, but they just let me know they can't actually hire me due to budgeting issues internally. they'll be letting me go at the end of march, so i need a new job.

where things get worse is i would like to move out from my parents ASAP; they're argumentative and have gotten hard to get along with in recent years. housing is so expensive in this area i don't feel like i could afford ANYTHING livable without making 6 figures. i've got 5 years of experience in administrative fields, and am used to making around $50K a year, but still; that's halfway to what i need to afford something. even if i do find a place to move out to that's still in the area, i can't imagine being able to get any kind of savings stacked up, due to just the sheer cost of daily needs here. california is just so absurdly expensive, i feel like i'm stuck in a loop right now.

to top things off, my girlfriend who is living with me and my family is currently attending a community college in the area. we wanted to move to idaho and go to a 4-year college there in the long run, but that likely won't be happening that soon at this rate.

i think, ideally, i'd like to find a job that wouldn't be compromised if i got the opportunity to move. i was thinking of looking for remote positions, but i know competition for those are extremely high, and i don't know that they'd hire someone with my experience/salary requests. i could be running in circles for months with no response, and that's no way to get out of this california loop i'm stuck in.

TL;DR, how the hell do i get out of california? i got myself stuck here and i feel like i'll never make the money i need to get out.

is there a middle ground option i'm missing in this situation? some, get out of jail free card or left-field option i've never heard of? have you ever been in this situation? what exactly did you to in order to get out of this loop?

really appreciate some help here. thanks guys!"

I am 44, quit teaching this year due to the toxic work environment and all the other things about teaching that were terrible and stressful. I am so much lighter now. My blood pressure went down to normal levels without meds, I am feeling creative and happy and whole again for the first time in years. I have a lot of anxiety dealing with high volume, stressful situations, and a lot of people. I hate politics and dealing with drama and popularity contests at work. I just want to go to work, do something like data entry and leave when it's my time to. Or, I want a job that I enjoy, like working outside or with animals.

I don't know what I can do right now without starting over. I am in so much debt from my schooling before this, I have a graduate degree in education etc.

I have kids, I need to offer them stability and start thinking about retirement. I don't think I should go back to teaching, it just turned into something I don't want to be a part of, total burn out and stress, horrible boss last year l, I moved schools, and even states.

I feel like a loser right now, I don't own my home, am in loan debt, hate the profession I trained for and went to do much school for, and I don't know what to do right now. I am half way through my life at this point and I have never been one to be down like this, but I am feeling time as a reality right now,  I never ever thought I am too old for this, or that, I always felt like I could start over, but all I am finding is that there are no professional jobs outside of education that will consider  me and I am worried because I have other people I need to be a role model for and help provide for. 

Right now my husband is working but his job salary is very low, so I am really feeling our financial situation and I need to return to work, but I want to do something beyond retail, etc. Those kind of jobs cause me stress also and are super low paying. 

I really thought about park ranger, but I saw that I had to go to an academy etc. 

I really need night job or a job between 9 and 2 so I can be here to drop kids off and pick up from school that would be ideal. 

Thank you for any thoughts you have on it."

Hi all, I've been submitting applications looking for an internship recently, and while I don't have any interviews yet I wanted to ask some questions and maybe be more prepared ahead of time. In the past, interviews have always been much more stressful and anxiety inducing than I think they should be, and I always get nervous and don't know what to say, or mess up something I was trying to say, or just leave an overall bad impression... I've messed up a lot of easy interviews just from getting too anxious, and I don't know how to get over it. 

For those of you who get similar types of anxiety, what techniques or methods do you use to stay calm and confident in an interview? 

If there's anything else I could use some help on it's how to prepare before an interview. Is there anything you do to prepare ahead if time that you think has been helpful? Like what sort of research should I do about the company? And what questions should I ask during/after the interview?

3585,"First 'Real' Job, Struggling","Hey everyone, 

  
tl;dr: I'm at my first graduate job where I've been thrown in the deep end and I'm really struggling

  
I'm not entirely sure if this is the best place to post this but I'm not doing so hot and I'm wondering if anyone has some advice. So I graduated last year and managed to get a really good graduate job, but I'm really struggling with it and I'm really scared I'm going to get fired if I don't manage to get it together. I feel like this job isn't really a 'graduate' job, it's significantly more senior than I could've imagined getting at this stage, to the point that for a few weeks I had someone underneath me who I was in charge of, not officially but I was giving him orders and checking his work etc. Kinda like a supervisor, but I was not an actual supervisor. He was let go recently, a decision that I strongly disagreed with but I didn't really get much of a say. The point I'm trying to get across here is I am essentially a 1 person department, I have a list of responsibilities as tall as me, the amount of things I have to produce and ship out is very high and the deadlines are very tight. I'm not complaining about this, I don't have a problem with working hard, the only trouble is I don't have much in the way of oversight or have anyone to proofread things/give quality control, except for my boss. 

  
My boss does not like to proofread things, she asks me to send her things to see before they go, but if she finds mistakes she gets very angry. I do ask her to check things for mistakes, but if she finds \*a\* mistake, she'll stop looking at it and send it back for everything to be fixed without me necessarily knowing if what she has highlighted is it or if there are other mistakes. This is making me so nervous that I'm reading things 15 - 20 times and obsessing over them which takes forever to do and is causing me to get seriously backlogged. So I find myself caught in this triangle of quality, speed and quantity, and finding the sweet spot really difficult since I'm really being asked to deliver at the extreme of all three.   
I'm really not sure what to do about this, I've got Grammarly installed on everything to maybe spot some mistakes and and I'm trying to be a lot more deliberate with my writing and what I'm producing but I don't know how to do that and meet my deadlines. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how to talk to my boss about, well, anything. We had a meeting on Friday where we discussed a bunch of issues, and I feel like I should've been able to stand up for myself during this but I couldn't. For example, she was angry at me for being late to an event we were at despite me being there when she asked me to be, something that she even admitted later. During this meeting, I was trying to answer her questions and give my side of these issues but I just couldn't, and the more I tried the less able to speak I was until I broke down in tears in front of her, which was so embarrassing.   
On top of this, my boss has complained about my hygiene which is really stressing me out. I shower once a day minimum, twice a day often, I wear 2 different types of deodorant and I don't spare the horses in applying them. I wash my clothes every weekend and never wear the same clothes for more than 2 days at worst, when I wash my clothes I don't leave them in the washing machine for any length of time, just put them straight on the drying rack. I've never had any complaints before about smell and I haven't noticed anything myself but I'm not entirely sure what I'm doing wrong or what to do differently.  I've bought a new aftershave and a roll-on deodorant to add to the roster. On top of that, I'm going to start mandating 2 showers a day and not wearing any of the same clothes more than once. Do you guys think that is enough?  


This jobs really taking a toll on me, I'm very anxious now, I'm breaking out in spots and rashes all over, I've been having on average 2 panic attacks a week and I keep needing to go to the bathroom to cry.  I find myself obsessing over things at work and developing ticks, I feel scared going into work or when I have to send anything to anyone because I know I'm going to get an earful when there's a mistake I haven't spotted.  I'm trying really hard to do a good job at this place but I'm really scared they're going to let me go or something.  I don't know how to improve or step up what I'm doing to the level that they want.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm really sorry that this has been a long, rambling mess and if you've read this far I really appreciate it.  If anyone has any words of advice I'd also really appreciate it."
3628,Working abroad during summer holidays.,"Hey guys. I am from Poland and would like to travel to work in Sweden. But I really can't work out how to do it.  I know I should get an apartment rented before going there, but should I find a job before actually traveling there? It's pretty hard, because no one puts online information that they are looking for a waiters or something, they probably expect you to leave the cv on the spot.  I also don't know whether I should go straight for a waiter job - I know English and German very well, and Polish is obviously my native language. I'm also learning Swedish, so maybe I should try to find some more ""businesslike"" job. I know this post is clumsy but I really would love to travel during that summer and have some experience instead of sitting on my ass in my hometown. Maybe some of you have some experience travelling for work and can help me out - most people that travel abroad have a very specified skill, they are engineers or programmers, so it doesn't really apply to me.

And my taste is not the best, no kidding. I will eat literal shit and not complain because I think everything tastes delicious, but other people would hate it (and sometimes I want to cook for other people). So I am afraid just going by what tastes good and what not won't work. Also, trial and error is not really an option as there are a ridiculous amount of different spices, the possibilities are just too many.

One thing that has bothered me for years is not having a hobby.  I simply don't have anything that I like to do.  I'm in grad school and that does take up time, plus I work full time.  But without a fun hobby to take my mind off of work and school, I begin to feel like all I do is work and study, and I start to really resent both.  My job is not stimulating in the least, it reminds me of when I worked at a cash register.  But I get paid pretty well, and it's very secure.

My boyfriend spends most of his spare time playing his video game on the computer.  He tells me I should find something to do, because when he goes and plays I'm bored as hell.  

How does an adult go about finding a hobby, or an interest?  

I'm generally at a loss.  And honestly I feel like a boring person.  I don't have fun in my life, and I need something.  I tend to slip into a depression, especially before my boyfriend lived with me, because I just don't know what to do with myself.

Don't get me wrong, I am supportive of the idea of independence and I even consider moving out myself, but I truly believe that I would be homeless if my parents decided to kick me out tomorrow.

Without a degree or certification, you are limited to mostly minimum wage jobs, and that is simply not a living wage. I apply to jobs and even the minimum wage ones are difficult to get without being rejected many times. And I simply cannot imagine doing well in college while also paying off tuition, rent, and other expenses.

Sure, roommates or a significant other would help to split the cost, but you are then reliant of everyone to not lose their job, and in a pandemic like this, I, again am amazed that people somehow can make-do without making any money at all! Living with parents with all our money pooled together is already a difficult challenge as it is.

I got my first real job at 22 which was fun but didn't pay well, so I decided to go back to school to better my life and future. I couldn't start school earlier because my parents would not let me take out loans under their name(s). Also going to college wasn't financially possible since my parents made too much money for me to get full financial aid. So, I joined a program that let me take college credits for free while working at an internship.

I completed the internship at age 23, got hired in the end, but then they let me go soon after when the company downsized and moved down the street. I was basically there to help them ""clean up"" before the move and I was too naive to realize this. After getting terminated, I went back to school but changed my major to health care. I'm graduating this year (associate degree) but still having bad luck with jobs that do not pay well and want to take advantage of me. I am transferring to a good medical college this summer, however, my classes will be online. I worked and paid my way through the associate degree without taking out loans, but I will definitely have to take out loans once I transfer to the new school.

I've tried to get my driver's license but it does not make sense for me right now because I can't afford a car and the payments. The first time I took the test, the instructor failed me because I was too cautious at a stop sign (yes, apparently that's grounds for failure). This was after spending almost $600 on professional driving lessons. Also, there is a waiting list to go for the test and now with this damn virus lockdown, my recent test appointment was canceled. My graduation is postponed. I'm unemployed. Every single time I seem to *almost* make progress, things happen that leave me in a worse situation. I know it seems like I'm making excuses but NOTHING works out in my favor. I don't have much emotional support because my parents blame these situations on me but don't understand that I'm trying. I am literally getting roadblocked regardless of how I try to go about things. I am generally positive about challenges, but this is bothering me. It hurts even more when I see people getting things that they want and they are barely trying.

I have never been to a doctor for any of my lady bits because my family ""didn't believe in that."" So my question is - what are some basics of hygiene that I should know? What are some ""tips and tricks"" I can learn from other women (like how to remove facial hair or what products to/not to use down there, for example)? What is something major that I might not be knowing about that I should really be doing?

3759,"How to deal with the energy, social &amp; performance requirements of a fulltime job","**TL;DR:** Working fulltime requires you to work at your absolute best, for as long as possible. It also requires social skills, at least enough to work well with your team, but ideally enough to feel comfortable around your co-workers and maybe make some friends. I'm a new grad looking for fulltime work...but I'm not ready at all. I was wondering if anyone had any advice on how to deal with a fulltime job (getting used to the work load, how to socially integrate, how to stay good at what you do, stuff in general etc.)

\-------------------------------------

I graduated in April and I've been applying to jobs since but I have this sinking feeling. I just don't understand how you're supposed to work for so long forever. 8 hours a day? Every day? For the rest of your life?  I can barely force myself to work an hour straight for more than 1 day in a row these days, let alone 5 days a week.

And it's not just working, you have to actually be good at what you do, and stay good always if you want to keep your job. I'm not the most competitive person nor particularly good at anything, constantly worrying about being at the top of the game sounds exhausting.

Finally, I'm a social wreck. I've never been able to socially integrate into any job I've ever had. Being a social outcast at my one full time internship made 40 hours feel like 400. My only saving grace till now is that every job I've worked except that internship has been part time.

I know this is reality whether I like it or not so I need to prepare, but I just don't know how.  I was wondering if anyone had any advice dealing with the three aspects I listed, or just any advice with working fulltime in general."

The balance on my card reads (numbers slightly edited for simplicity) 250. But my limit is 500. I thought this meant that i had 250 left available to spend until I made another payment. However, I unexpectedly got declined today and was surprised. I went home and checked my statement and I was out of credit. But the report still read 250 balance. What does the balance mean if not how much you owe the credit card company? So I paid 250. But it didnt change the balance. So I paid 250 again. With the actual numbers this would put me over 500 available credit, and my summary reflected a perfect 500 in credit. But the balance is unchanged (payments update automatically with my bank). Can someone help me figure out what is going on here? And also where that extra money went because I definitely paid more than 500 credit and I dont see the extra (60 something dollars in actuality) money anywhere on my account. It just disappeared. I would really appreciate any help."
3855,How to find a doctor,I've just turned 20 and I haven't been to a doctor since i was 9 or 10 but now I can afford it but I don't know where to start? How do you find a doctor? A good one? Do you interview them? Are there online reviews?? How'd you find your doctor?
3865,Buying a mattress for the first time?,"Sooo.

I've never bought a mattress before.  I'm still using the one my parents gave me back in 2006.  I moved out and took it with me.  As you can probably imagine, years of being a teenager/general existence have rendered this particular mattress gross as hell and it's literally falling apart.  I won't be able to finance it because my credit is crap, so I'll probably pay cash.

How do I know what to look for?  I feel SO stupid but I literally don't know what to do or look for.  Will they get rid of my old mattress and boxspring when they come?  Wht about the bedframe itself (feels like it might be attached to the boxspring?). Will they judge me because my mattress is literally falling apart?"

3891,Filing taxes for the first time as an independent contractor (I think that's the term?) -- how do I know if I've made enough money to owe the IRS?,"**TL;DR - How much of my onlyfans earnings do I need to not spend on stupid shit between now and April in order to make sure I have enough money to give the IRS? And other Dumb Bitch Questions.**

My finances my whole adult life have been tax-exempt. I have a disability and because of that, I've found that (legal) sex work is the type of work that makes the most sense for my life. I did a W9 for the first time in November 2020. As tax time comes up, how much of my earnings should I be making sure I have available in April? I heard that I have to ""report"" the income if it's over $600 in a calendar year (I don't know what ""report income"" means, like who do I tell? Where do I get the appropriate paperwork?), and so far November 2020-January 2021 I've made about that much from one revenue stream. However I've also heard that if your earnings are under $9,000 in a calendar year then you don't owe the IRS. On top of that, in my vague sense of ""deductions"" and ""work expenses,"" I've invested easily half of what I've made so far on equipment which has enhanced my game and propelled my work/""career""/earnings.

My main question is what percentage of my earnings I should be saving to make sure I'm not broke at tax time -- this is a reality for me because so far I've lived my life basically on an allowance and it's been meager, so I often have $0 in my bank account. This is just normal for me. I don't want to defend it or explain it, I just need to ask you to understand that this is my reality and I do not have any way of changing that, normally. Now that I have some legitimate income that's coming in on top of what I receive that's meant to cover the bare minimum for, like, comfortable survival, I'm able to keep like a hundred bucks or more in my account at any given time without dipping down to $0. However if I need to pay the IRS, like, several hundred dollars I need to know that now, so that I don't spend too much of what I make between now and then.

Sorry, for anyone who lives in the real world I'm sure this post is super annoying but being such basic info, hopefully someone here has the quick, easy answer, because google is not helping me on this. I'm going to get help from my mom at some point (and reveal to her that I'm doing some light sex work, which shouldn't be a point of contention, I have a very progressive family -- my mom is genuinely so helpful that I can't justify hiding this from her when I know she can help) but I do NOT want her to be learning about it in the context of ""I'm totally lost mom I have no idea what I'm doing."" I want to at least be able to say to her ""here's what I understand I need to do here"" so that she can recognize my right to choose what to do for myself and not be a totally helpless idiot about it.

My last question is about US stimulus relief -- I was surprised to get $1,200 in May 2020, because my funds already come from the state and they've landed on a particular amount that's stayed pretty much the same for many years. I guess the lockdown caused expenses to change for people, and that must be why I got it. I also got $600 on January 1st. I know that the stimulus plan excludes sex workers from eligibility, but if I'm declaring myself to the state as a sex worker in April 2021, but I've only been one since November 2020, does that mean that stimulus relief in 2021 may apply to me, since it will only be November 2021 that marks me as, like, an actual fully-functioning sex worker and not just someone selling a few videos and then walking away from the hobby? Obviously this stimulus info is really vague and up in the air for everyone, but basically my question is about what filing taxes does to the designation that the state gives us to organize us by income and industry -- like, am I a sex worker in April 2021, or am I not a sex worker until November 2021? What does ""a year"" mean to the IRS?

Thanks so much for reading."
3892,How do I buy a house?,"My boyfriend and I want to start the process of buying our first home this year, but I have no idea what the first steps are. I was told by a friend that I need to contact a mortgage broker, but we don't know any steps after that."
3922,Buying a car when you're a woman,"So, my car is dead/dying, and I want a new one. Subaru is having a 0% APR for 63 months deal and I want to take it, and I want to go to the dealer this weekend.

I've been advised by pretty much every source – my dad, the bank teller who I talked about loans with, every website about car buying – to bring a man with me or, better yet, pretend that it is the man who's buying a car, because we'll be less likely to be snookered. I live with my fiancé so the plan is to bring him. And I'd bring him regardless – he's the one with a functional car right now, for one thing – but I'm not sure if I want them to think it's ""his"" car.

I'm of two minds about this. On the one hand, I do acknowledge that sexism (especially in car sales) is a huge problem, and I want to give myself a leg up when I can. I don't want to give away an advantage for the sake of my feminist pride.

On the other hand:

* It's going to be my car. I'm going to be the one paying for it, it's my credit they'll be checking, I'm trading in my old car, and more importantly I'm the only one of us who has a *job* right now because of COVID, so I feel like it'd be very confusing to make out like it's my fiancé's car right up until I buy it. Especially since I'm a good six inches shorter than him, and I want to test drive it because my legs are shorter and some cars literally don't pull up close enough for me to reach the pedals.
* I feel like part of the advantage of taking a man with you is that they know more about cars than you... but my fiancé is not a man's man who goes out and fixes machines in his spare time. He knows how to fill the oil and windshield wiper fluid and change a tire, but that's about it. 
* I'm not looking for anything complicated. I want a baseline model with zero frills, and I'm not going to get drawn into the siren song of getting fancy floor mats or whatever. The only ""extra"" I want is CVT rather than MT.
* I feel like I'd rather know if the salesman is a sexist asshole so I can leave the dealership and deny them my business.

I don't know, has anyone had similar experiences?"
3924,I put my two weeks in at a part time job I've been working for six months and they want a formal written letter,"So yeah I've been working at a retail place for six months and in that time I was promoted to a temporary key holder. 

I also have a second job that I work 40 hours a week, which means I stress a lot and sleep very little. After discussing with my therapist, he suggested I quit one job to focus on my mental health more 

Since the job this post is about is an hour drive there and back for me, and they only pay me $11.50 an hour, I decided to quit this job. 

When I told the manager on duty, they said to wait until the store manager was in (on Sunday) and to bring a formal letter stating that I was putting in my two weeks and why I was quitting. 

Is this common for part time jobs? Should I even write the letter? I'd like to use them as a reference but honestly at this point I don't know if I need too."
3925,How to help my mom get help for my grandma who most likely has Dementia,"Hi, I hope this is an appropriate sub for this post. My grandma is in her 70s and we have noticed her become more and more forgetful over the past 3-5 years. She seems to be stuck in time and thinks something that happened years ago, happened yesterday. And not remember what actually happened yesterday. The only family she has is my mom who lives 20 minutes from her,  and I live 1.5 hours away from them so I'm not much help when it comes to hands on stuff.

My mom loves to vent to me how she can't get through to my grandma, and she is only getting more frustrated with the situation. My mom has to take care of my grandma's very large house and yard, scheduling appointments,  reminding her of this and that daily. Anytime we tell my grandma we really need to start finding her more help, possibly sell her house, move her into assisted living, ANYTHING that has to do with her memory or old age, she just laughs and says there's no problem and we're the crazy ones. 

Anyways, I feel like anything I suggest to my mom just gets shut down by her, because she knows my grandma will shut it down and we are getting no where! It also doesn't help that I don't know what all my resources are and that I live far away to really do anything. How can I get my mom to ""pull the trigger"" and start taking matters into her own hands instead of waiting for my grandma to give in? Because it's very likely that day won't come and I'd hate to wait until my grandma became seriously injured or lost or worst for that to happen."
3959,Paralyzed - Working From Home,"I've been working from home since mid-March and though I started off okay, I quickly fell apart. 

I know I need to wake up and work, but I sleep in.
I know I need to work, but I lay in bed or sit on the couch and watch Tik Toks or order take out I don't need.  
I answer important time sensitive things or keep making excuses for why things aren't done. 

I love my job, truly.  At first it was stress from the virus and staying healthy and seeing the U.S. fail at handling it.  And now it's the protests and feeling so helpless about the future of our nation and like I should be doing more to help the movements.

I will sit for the entire workweek doing the bare minimum, paralyzed to actually work.  I've tried setting timers, making routines, and schedules... None of it works. 

I have a to do list 3 months long that I need to get my ass in gear and do or someone is going to start noticing. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know how to shake this empty, unmotivated, feeling where I'm just unable to bring myself to wake up on time, sit at the computer all day, and get things done.  I've tried mindfulness and that goobly gook and it doesn't do anything for me I don't believe in it.   

Not only work, anything. I just sit all day, refreshing social media, mostly twitter to follow the protests.  And then somehow it's 3 a.m. Food has become an enemy-none of it sounds good I don't feel like cooking anything so I usually starve all day then order a whole pizza or take out from somewhere and gorge.  I was working out for a solid week to try to get energy and lose weight and that crumbled too. 

I just want my life back, please help."
3970,First birthday I'm not looking forward to.,"I (M26) feel like I've finally made it to that point where I understand why adults aren't always excited to have aged another year.  Sometimes it's about getting older.  But a lot of the time I think it's about expectations we have for ourselves.

First, I want to acknowledge that I have had some significant challenges with my mental health the past few years.  I have diagnosed depression, but I got back on my medication last month and I'm now seeing a therapist, so I'm finally taking care of that again.  I know my depression made everything feel a bit worse.

My 26th birthday is next month.  In the past few years, my life has been a bit of a tornado.  I have my first full time job, and I'm nearly done with my master's degree.  I have my first pets (dog and reptile) that I'm 100% responsible for the care of.  I've moved out into my own apartment, and I finally have the damn place the way I like it.  I dated for the first time just over a year ago, am in a relationship for the first time, and he moved in with me about five months ago.  I am 100% financially independent, which is scary as hell.

I didn't think I would ever accomplish the things I have the past few years.  But it's difficult to actually see any of these things as ""accomplishments"".  I was raised to believe that being self sufficient was the goal in life pretty much, and people who rely on others a lot are failures in some way.  Typical White American mindset.  

Thing is, I'm really tired.  Like, exhausted.  (Admitting this is something else I was raised to believe was bad - weakness, even.)  I really just want to get to the part of my life where I can have a good time.  I know that's selfish to say, or lazy or whatever.  But I really want to start enjoying myself.  If I'm not depressed, I have a general feeling of apathy about most things.  I can't enjoy anything, nothing makes me excited.  I am finding it very difficult to muster up the enthusiasm required for school and work.

Turning 26 feels like a big one.  25 did as well.  When I think about what I wanted to accomplish this year - I suppose I did a lot of what I wanted.  I'm just still not happy, and I don't know why.  And I'm not excited to be moving forward when nothing brings me joy.  I don't know how people just get through life with a smile.

I just really wanted to be in a place where I was having a good time by 26.  I feel I've let myself down."
3974,Several questions about buying a car.,"I'm actually gonna buy a car. I can get a really nice loan for the amount and my neighbors are selling a car for a decent price too, but I have some questions before I get too deep...

• I have a permit but not a license, is that okay?

•I don't have insurance, do I need it before I buy a car, and how do I get it?

• Do I take out the loan first and then talk to the seller, do it after, or during?

•Do I have to go through anything special since I'm not buying it off a car lot? (In Ohio)

•Ive heard I need to get a title, what is it and how do I do it? 

• I don't wanna talk to my neighbor and look like an idiot and since I don't know him very well I also don't wanna get ripped off due to inexperience and being young, is there anything else important I need to know or look for?"
4029,Hello! I'm not an adult but I need help with adulting for SHS (ASAP),"I'm going to my school today to pickup important documents so I can enroll in another school for SHS.

The problem is I don't know what documents I should pick up. The only thing I know I should have is my report card, my NCAE and my student moral something.

That's the stuff my stepmom told me to get before going on a rant about how I should know these things already because when she was going to college, she did everything on her own.

I could ask the teachers about the stuff I need but it makes me incredibly anxious and I start to worry if I'm bothering them.

I'm 16 years old, and I guess I really should know these things, but I don't. Thank you for taking the time to read this, it would be great if you could give tips or tell me what I need to get from the school."
4076,"Became a victim of Title Jumping, now I need to find a lawyer (FL)","Long story short I got scammed in February by a guy selling a car, went to the dmv to register and they said ""either get in contact with the last legal owner or get yourself a lawyer."" Since I did not have a lot of money I found the last legal owner and he was unable to transfer legal ownership of the car to me because he had a lien on it and no paperwork proving it was paid (on top of proof that the FIRST owner of the car paid off THEIR lien was lost in some paper shuffle)

I bought this car in February before Covid shut most things down and now that I'm working again I'm desperate to legally own the car that's been sitting in my driveway. I need it otherwise I'm paying $40 a day to lyft to and from work.

I'm done trying to find this paperwork, I've called so many people and companies and made zero progress. I'm at a point to where I'm willing to seriously struggle if I have to in order to get a lawyer. My problem is, I have no idea how to do that? I dont know what kind of lawyer I need much less how to track one down. Anybody have any advice? I dont even know what kind of action the Lawyer can help me with. Will they be able to get the court to award me the car or something? Even pointing me in a direction where I can start my research would be infinitely helpful I have no starting point.

(Note: I now know that buying a car from a regular ass dude was a bad idea, I'm never doing it again dont recommend to anyone else especially if you're like me and don't know anything about nothing.)"
4078,26F. What are positive ways that i can do to change my life faster right now?,"I feel pretty stuck right now. I live with my folks still, and it gets stressful and suffocating even more so during a pandemic. I love them and we usually get along, but they don't see me as an adult. I'm trying my hardest to change how they see me; but that's on me because I have taken advantage of the privilege of still being at home.  

Ive recently applied for school, and taking two online math requirement classes: one basic math class now, and math essentials next month. Looking into more classes to take for my major. 

and in less than a week, I'll be working as a server at an elderly care retirement home after three-four months of not working due to the pandemic. 

but i still feel stuck, and i don't know what else i can do to move forward, and i don't know how to form a life during a pandemic either. My goals is to save as much money as I can for my own place, but I don't know how long thatll take.  

How are yall handling everything? What else can I do to feel like more of an adult and take more control of my life? Ive been held back so much just due to depression and mental illness, and I've recovered from it about 60% from it and I deal with just.

4123,Choosing where to live after graduating,"I (23f) will be graduating with my MPA (health policy/admin emphasis) this fall, and I am starting to look at jobs and new places to live. I have been in the same state for my whole life, and I have been at the same large state school for 6 years (undergrad and grad). The obvious next step is to move to Atlanta due to my familiarity with the city and the potential job prospects. However, I really want to explore a new area of the US while I am still younger and single. My question for you is: how did you pick and settle in a new place that you were unfamiliar with or never visited? Do you have any regrets moving away from the familiar?

4145,I'm 26F and thinking about going back to school,"On mobile so please forgive any mistakes

As the title says, im 26F with 2 kids, 9 and 8 months. I made it through high-school and graduated (a year late for what should be a pretty obvious reason) I tried going to college right after but hated it, never went to classes, never studied and dropped out. I went through a program a few months after I turned 21 to drive a semi truck and loved it. Drove over the road, did local and eventually settled into end dump and thats what i did til I was 20 weeks pregnant with my 8 month old. And now I'm a stay at home mom while my SO is an over the road cattle hauler. I think im ready to go back to school but im not really sure where to start. The program im looking into is at a community college close by. An Associates in applied science for equine science. Now, I dont know a ton about horses beyond what my daughter has learned at her weekly horse lessons but growing up I wanted to be a vet for horses and other farm animals. Obviously I probably can't be a vet (I was told I was too dumb when I was growing up) but I think this would be the closest I could get to it. I was having a pretty emotional response while looking into it. First it was because it was overwhelming, then because I had no idea how to apply or if I should do a FASFA, how to talk to an advisor, then it was because how in the world could I do this as practically a single parent with no nearby support system (SO is gone for about a month at a time and my nearest family is 2.5 hours away). Is it worth it to keep looking into, where do I start. I had an email sent to me saying I need to take a placement test and all that but I dont know. I feel like im over thinking it l, maybe I cant do it, maybe this is dumb, etc. I just don't know where to start. Classes start August 17th, is it too late for this coming semester? I'm in the Midwest, US if that makes a difference

Please forgive me if this doesn't make any sense, im so overwhelmed and I feel all jumbled. 

I havent talked to my mom about it yet, she suggested looking into college again but I doubt this is the kind of thing she was thinking. My SO and I are also talking about just buying another semi and  putting me to work doing construction end dump, but he's supportive of me going back to school if its what I want."
4159,Doctors and Case Management: How Do I Choose? (Tricare),"I finally have to find a doctor on my own, and I really don't know what to do/look for/pick. I have to find someone in-network (Tricare YA Select), but there are so many options and I'm just so overwhelmed on what to do.

I was also thinking of getting a case manager through my insurance to help me find someone and to find other types of healthcare professionals (I'm chronically ill), but I definitely can't seem to figure out how to find one of those either. I can't figure out who to contact or what to do, and it's really thrown me for a tizzy and isn't allowing me to move forward with my healthcare plans.

4339,How do I push myself even when I'm sick?,"I am a really really hard worker. I LOVE my job &amp; I want to work hard &amp; do it well. But there are some days I am just. so. tired. I have bipolar disorder &amp; my energy levels fluctuate like crazy, especially in the fall &amp; spring, so I know the tired is different for me than it is for most people. But I just want to do my job. I just want to be able to push myself - when I know it won't make me worse. I reduced my hours to 3 days a week which is perfect for me. I take my meds &amp; I try and do everything I can, when I can. But I still find myself letting the kids I tutor have too much reward time on the ipad just so I can scroll through pinterest, or sometimes skipping things I know they'll fight me on. I don't know - is that normal? Is it silly of me to imagine adults do things at 100%, 100% of the time? What do you tell yourself to push yourself through the day? "
4365,Sort of urgent: Should I stay self-employed or apply for a permanent position?,"Thanks for coming here. Please enjoy the following stream of conscience.

After finishing my studies last year, I started working as a freelancer in the respective area. Now I'm faced with a possible job offer at a company some 30 km from home. I don't know if I should pursue this position or not. I was asked to send my CV this afternoon.

Freelancing and working from home is wonderful if you have a lot of work, and very frustrating when you haven't. I really enjoy the lifestyle that comes with with being your own boss. Sometimes I work non-stop until 10 pm and get up at 5 am to meet a deadline. At other times I'm free to go to the gym in the afternoon or work in the garden at 10 am. Other times I just spend idling without anything to do (and no, learning a programming language wouldn't help me in my career).
The past few months I have had roughly enough jobs to make enough money to live on my own (I'm still living at my parents' home for financial and feline reasons). If I actually worked 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, I could make more than in any permanent job available with my degree. However, more often than not that isn't the case, and I haven't gathered enough savings yet.
You could argure now that, since I'm still a beginner, I should try to improve my income as a freelancer and things will be fine soon. BUT: The industry I'm in is changing dramatically, and I estimate that the kind of jobs I am doing now will be automated and largely disappear within few years. If I want to stay, I have to gain considerable experience, skills, knowledge.

The mentioned permanent position would offer me exactly that. It would involve challenging yet, presumingly, intersting tasks I could show off later in my career. I would have reliable income that would allow me to move out. I could improve my social skills and see how things work in the real world. I could make decisions. It would make me feel part of something bigger. Sounds perfect for adulting, right? If it wasn't for my gut feeling:

I have grown to hate the idea of being obliged to be physically present at an employer's site when the clock shows a certain number of hours, even if it makes sense. I feel uncomfortable when working in offices. I don't want to eat a colleague's birthday cake, I don't want to be morally obliged to go to company parties in my free time. I don't want to work in an environment where being loud, bold, convincing is what makes you popular and climb the ladder. I am used to travelling and being able to work wherever I have an internet connection - with a permanent job, I would have little more than 20-25 sacred days on which I would be ""allowed"" to leave an area of 50 km around the office for more than two days. My best friend (it was a cat, but still) was dying while I was sitting in an office without any work to do, pretending to be busy when the boss entered the room; had I been working at home at that time I could have give him company. As you can see: I don't really feel like going there. I very much feel like doing the job, but if I accept the offer, I'll be stuck there for a couple of years. While I technically CAN leave at any time, that wouln't be very fair towards them, as they would have invested a lot of time in me.

What do you say?"
4372,someone please just help im dumb,I am a 19 year old full time student who lives in Florida and I currently live in a shitty ((but cheap)) apartment with my fiance and his brother so we just split the rent every month. I just recently (last month) got a job in retail in which pays decent and I get at least 30 hours a week but I hate the job with a passion because you know...retail. But ANYWAY I got an offer to become a certified pharmacy technician with starting pay a few dollars more where I'm currently working and get the entire certification for free but the catch is for probably the first few months I will barely get any hours and I seriously need money because I have no back up plan so if I cannot afford rent/utilities/food I'm screwed. I'm taking mostly online courses this semester so my availability is open for the most part but **I feel like I'm risking a lot!** I'm thinking about working both jobs but I feel like they won't like hearing my drastic change in availability which will make me choose between the two. I have no clue what to do! I don't know if I should just do both or stay where I am or leave and get the certification. 
4442,Should I call in on my second day?,"Okay this seems probably like a stupid question, but I genuinely don't know what to do so I could use some advice.

I started a new job yesterday working night shift at a grocery store stocking shelves (2am - 8am). However, ever since I woke up this afternoon after my first shift (about 8 hours ago), I have been making frequent trips to the bathroom and have been having diarrhea everytime I go. I have been unable to keep any food in my system, as anything I eat makes me need to run to the bathroom within 15-20 minutes. I've tried plain toast, saltines, even gatorade. It all just exits my system in a big watery mess.

I've been trying to keep hydrated, but I don't think it's working because I have a migraine so bad right now. I do have another job besides this new one that I had to call in to because of this. All I've done is sleep all day today and I still feel awful.

I kind of feel like a jerk for calling in on my second day, especially because I know they were going to train me on the job more, but I don't think it's safe for me to go to work tonight.

Can I get opinions on this? Would I be looked at wrongly for calling in tonight on my second shift while I'm feeling this way? Should I call right now as opposed to 2 hours before my shift?"

I recently got bit by a dog and went to the clinic and I needed to pay $200 immediately because I have no insurance. I didn't have those $200 on hand so I used my credit card.

I've been trying to get a bank account with Chime but have hit some bumps, it's fine, but it's causing me to think about other banks. I don't really know what to do? I've been told go with a bank with no fees (that's only online ones), go with a physical one, go with a local one, etc.

I was advised to look into getting a credit card so I could build up my score to getting a better deal on financing a car, Chime doesn't offer that yet.

I've been considering/pointed to Chase, Ally, CapitalOne and a credit union. Any seasoned advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to drive a car, and I don't have my license either. I know, not having a license at 18 is weird.

I was planning on paying a driving school in my town $300 for classes, but...I don't know anymore. I brought it up to my boss and she said she'd look into finding someone to teach me, that was 2 weeks ago. I don't want to bug her about mentioning she'd try to find someone, so I'm trying to figure this myself.

How should I learn? Should I ask a friend? (My parents aren't options, my mom refuses to and to let my dad, and he's awful at driving tbh)

Should I pay for the classes? I don't believe they have physical classes in December and I'm too late for signing up for classes this month, the first class of this month was today.

I don't know how soon I'd be able to get my license, I read some things saying I'll need to have a permit for 120 days or have 50 hours of supervised driving, I don't know what it relates to or if it applies to me since I'm 18.

I've heard about videos on youtube, but I probably need more education beyond that.

&amp;#x200B;

My third new-to-adulthood problem, I don't know how to get a car exactly. I have my mind set on getting a pre-owned Toyota from a dealership, I'm saving up for a downpayment, but...I don't know what to do once I get enough. Or what it requires, please tell I'm wrong thinking I'll need a parent to co-sign? I know neither of them will if I have to. Can I have someone else co-sign?

How can I get a good deal with financing? That leads back to building up a credit score, a friend of mine told me he got to have his brother sign cause he's got a pretty good score. 

How the hell do I pick an insurance company that won't hate me cause I'm 18?

I've been losing my mind thinking about all this the past few days, I'd appreciate any help or advice."
4673,"First ""adult"" job - benefits","I've been offered my first job out of college. I'm almost done with the process, so far, so good. Now, the company has sent me the benefits package, and they look like great benefits - medical, vision, dental on top of a great starting salary. 

My question is: are there any questions I should ask during my onboarding? Anything you wish you would've asked or known when you first started? I don't know much about insurance and benefits other than what I've been googling, but I thought I should ask for any specifics that I may miss. Thanks!"
4676,Buying first home advice?,"So I've been told I can get a mortgage for my first ever home (a flat) thanks to my gran leaving behind some money for a deposit when she passed away a few years ago. Now, this is real adulting way over my head and I was wondering if anyone can offer any advice?

I'm UK-based, looking around and outside Glasgow,  I've spoken to a mortgage advisor at my bank, I know my budget, I'm looking at places online (tenements, cottage flats, mix of building types and places), got a couple of viewings booked, but I'm not sure where to go from here and feeling a bit overwhelmed. 

I have ruled out tonnes of places based on imperfect home reports - some having an issue with high damp readings or electrics need redone or windows need redone or roofing needs redone. On my budget I know a place might need work, but I don't have money to spend on major repairs straight away. 
Anyone with any previous experience know what the types of repairs above might cost or what would definitely put you off a place or what can be dealt with down the line?

Friends and family keep suggesting different areas of Glasgow or outside Glasgow that are good for commuting and I don't know much about a lot of areas. I don't have a car atm but will be looking to get one once I've found a place, but I would probably need to use public transport to Glasgow city centre for work until then. 
Could anyone suggest places that are good to live and commute from and places to avoid?

Or any other tips re buying?

Thank you so much for reading this and for any advice! :)"
4730,How do I meet new people?,"Hi there, first time poster so bear with me. Today I'm moving to start my first big girl job. I've been living in a university town for the past 4.5 years and I just realized I don't know how to meet people as a real adult! In school, you can just join a few clubs and you're set but I'm not sure how to go about establishing new friends otherwise. Does anyone have any advice about making new friends or meeting people after moving to a new area?"
4735,Moving out of my childhood home next week. Worried about a lot of shit.,"I've lived in my childhood home for as long as I remember. My mom moved away in 2015 and my brother moved in with two of his friends in 2017. It's just been me and my dad the past two years.

I've been actively trying to get an apartment for a long time now, but things didn't start happening until last month. I've since done a lot of work in preparation for moving out. I got sick for about two weeks so the move has been delayed a little (officially I've already ""moved"" on the 1st of November, which is when I got my keys). I started the arduous task of deep cleaning the new apartment last weekend but I've had to take a few days off as I pushed myself a little too hard after having just recovered from a very bad flu.

I digress. Anyway, cleaning aside, the only thing left is moving all of my stuff there. My sister has a car and I don't have a whole lot of stuff so it should be doable. I'm more worried about the actual *living* aspect. There are a lot of things that I don't know the first thing about, and I feel like I'm fucking myself over by moving out. But at the same time, I really want to do it! I want to have some privacy, and I want to be able to get my own life moving in some direction. I want freedom, which I don't have if I'm stuck living with my dad.

I've gotten used to so many luxuries by living with my dad all these years. He's always cooked us dinner so I never learned how to cook anything. He did the laundry too and took care of pretty much everything. It might sound like I'm a spoiled piece of shit, but I have my reasons for why it was like this (mostly due to my bad health).

But now I need to learn to do everything by myself. Also, no more dishwasher! The apartment is too small to get one so I'll have to clean dishes with my bare hands. That's a nightmare for a germaphobe like me. I literally gag by just putting dirty dishes in the machine. Can't get a washing machine for clothes either so I'll have to use the neighborhood's washing machine. No idea how that's gonna go but I'll just have to figure it out.

I don't know if I'm looking for any kind of advice here, I just wanted to vent out some of my frustrations. As awesome as it is to move out and have privacy and freedom, I'm giving up a lot by doing it. But I also acknowledge that my dad won't be around forever to take care of me, and one day it might even be the other way around. Which is why I see this as a necessary step forward. It's gonna suck at first but I'll do what I always did and just figure shit out as I go."
4737,"When did you have your self-awareness ""A-Ha"" moment?","That might be an odd way to phrase this question so i'll explain what I am trying to get at here. It seems like many adults at some point within their lifetime have this life altering moment where they become very self-aware, they realize what kind of life they're leading, and they realize that they need to make a change. For instance, you're up all night partying and doing drugs with strangers the night before a big interview or event and you suddenly realize like, okay I have a drug problem. But then you ACTUALLY make that chance. I have these little ""Ah-ha"" moments constantly, where I see the changes I could make, but I'm wondering if i'll ever wake up and actually make the changes. It seems like i'm missing some sort of motivator. View this video here if you'd like, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3IhIj4KzU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND3IhIj4KzU)\-- its about my favorite comedian, Theo Von, detailing this experience that I am looking for. He explains his childhood-- things that you might not realize about yourself until you're an adult like how you felt less than other kids, being ashamed of the place you grew up, or not having a close relationship with your parents. This is the video that has fueled my curiosity to make this post. He seems like he understands his positioning in this world. He objectively sees the things that have happened to him, how they might differ from others, and he understands how those events have shaped him as a human being.  Now reflecting upon my own life (21F), I just feel so lost. It feels like throughout my entire life things have just been happening to me, I can't catch up, and I have no understand of why I am the way that I am. I feel extremely discouraged, like I'm never going to find myself or fix myself. I'm not looking for something to blame my actions on, I really just want to see that I'm not crazy and I do the things that I do for some or ANY reason, whether it be good or bad reason isn't really the point. I've searched for some degree of validation from my parents and they simply seem to think that i've pulled all of my issues out of my ass for no reason, and that there is nothing that anyone has done or that has happened to me that can explain my problems. Like I'm just a complete fuck up and I deserve everything because its solely my fault. For example, i'm really scared and insecure about life, I feel hopeless, I feel bitter, I allow people to treat me badly, I always feel inferior or unlikeable, I really dislike people, etc. I just wish I had that objective understanding to make a connection between the cards I was dealt, the things that have happened to me, and the person that i've become so that I can fix my life and my internal battle. I just want to be happy and I feel so discouraged because I don't know when it gets better or when things become clearer. SO I guess what I'm really wondering is WHEN were you comfortable with who you are? At what age should I begin to see this stuff?"
4744,How do you move to a place far away safely?,"I'm a poor near minimum wage worker, I only have about $2,500 in savings, and I want to move to a town many hundreds of miles away where I don't know anyone. How does one do this safely?

The only jobs I'm qualified to do (near minimum wage jobs) aren't going to hire me over the Internet without an in person interview so I have to arrive there without employment. Will places let you sign a lease over the phone / internet without viewing the location? 

Is this move even realistically possible? Or because I'm poor am I basically stuck where I am? I hate the city I live in and the rent is half my income. I really want to leave. 

I'd appreciate any advice or insight you can give I've never done anything like this before and I'm not particularly bright. Thank you."
4759,Went from a job I loved to a job I can barely convince myself to go to every morning,"Ok. I'm 23. Since graduating from college, I was working 50+ hours a week at a job I absolutely loved. Loved so much, I didn't mind going every day, and was really heartbroken over the idea of ever leaving. The hours were perfect for me. It was theatre, so I was still working 8-12 hours a day, but they were from like noon-midnight or 3pm-11pm. I still had the daylight hours to myself to get things done. I have 2 autoimmune illnesses and Chronic Fatigue, so doctor's appointments were easy to schedule and if I couldn't get out of bed at 7 am, I didn't have to and was still considered a model employee. I loved my co-workers and the environment and really felt like I was making a difference. But, the pay was atrocious. I worked my ass off, but was making barely anything and had no benefits. I was living with my parents and felt severe pressure to ""grow up."" So I got a new job. Good pay. Amazing benefits. But my greatest fear - 8:30-4:30 are the hours. I've been here for 8 weeks now and it's a lot to not cry every day. Not to sound like a ""precious millennial"" as my mother would call me - but I'm having a hard time. I've dealt with manic depression and anxiety for years but not in this way. Even when I was SUICIDAL in high school and actively self-harming, I didn't feel this way, because I least had a glimmer of hope that it would be over in x amount of years. But now, it's like - is this my life? Everyday? Till I die? 8-5? Pretending like I don't feel like crap every day from my autoimmune problems? Feeling like I have no time for anything other than working and hopefully having enough energy at the end of the day to take my makeup off before collapsing? Crying in my office because I don't feel well and just need to lie down but can't tell anyone because ""this is adulthood""? My anxiety is constantly through the roof. More panic attacks than ever. I don't know what to do. I just feel absolutely lost and hopeless and like I'm constantly going to crawl out of my skin.  Is this it?"
4763,I don't know how to be an adult,"I turned 18 a couple of months ago and currently I am still in school, but my problem is for when I get out, my parents said that I can stay with them for two months after I finish school but after that they would like to see me be more independent.

I don't know anything about how to be an adult.

Examples:
-I don't know how to get a job
-I don't know how to not get scammed for my salary or about how much should I work
-I don't know how taxing works or how it is payed
-I don't know how insurance, health insurance, dental insurance...etc. works or how to get it
-Should I go to a bank to get a debit or credit cards
-what is the difference between debit and credit cards
-how to not get scammed by the bank
...etc .

Basically what I lack is basic adult knowledge.

Why don't they teach this stuff in school it is easily more important than most of the other subjects they teach.

If you can link me sources from where to learn, stuff I've missed, or even tell me a little information i would immensely grateful.

4770,[help] I have a fruit fly problem in my apartment,"I've been living in my apartment for roughly 6 months, a couple times we kept bananas on the counter for a little too long and brought in a group of fruit flies that I easily fought off with apple cider vinegar and dish soap traps.

All of a sudden we have an even bigger infestation of fruit flies and I do not know why at all. We have not had any fruit left on the counters for at least a month so I don't know what brought them in.  I've been setting the same apple cider vinegar and dish soap traps and they have been killing a lot of the flies but there are always 3 or 4 visibly flying around it seems..

I'm thinking maybe they could be coming from the garbage disposal and was planning on buying product like bleach or something else to try and clean out the sink drains but I'm not sure if that is the route I should take or if there is a different product I should get or if there is another target they might be coming from that I'm missing.  

\-additional information: I keep the apartment clean, I do the dishes almost daily and a few days ago I went and wiped down all the surfaces with Lysol because I read fruit flies don't like clean surfaces so out of frustration I clean everything even though it was all visibly clean already. I also try to quickly dispose of expired goods like bread.

I am completely lost by what to do so any help will be greatly appreciated."
4789,How should I go about writing a resume? Do I even need one?,"Hi everyone, I'm an 18-year-old former homeschooler looking to apply for my first job at a frozen yogurt chain. The only problem is that I have no idea what a resume should look like, what it should include, or if I even need one for this kind of job.

As for education I was homeschooled all my life (and I graduated last year), I don't know what my GPA is, and I technically still don't have a diploma because we still haven't ordered it yet. I haven't started college yet, either. So I have no idea how I'd go about mentioning education on my resume.

Then for volunteer work I've volunteered on my church's worship team since 2016, and their production team since around the end of last year.

I've done some research online and some people have said a resume should be 1-2 pages long. Is this true? If so, what other sorts of things could I write on my resume? Do I even need a resume? Would my application be good enough with just a reference? What I'm applying for seems like an entry-level position.

4793,How can I figure out what I truly want in life?,"First of all, I don't know that this question can ever fully be answered but I've been feeling a little lost lately. I am 23 years old with a bachelor's degree and I work at a non-profit agency. While I enjoy my job, I can't help but feel like it isn't long-term. I have no idea what my long-term career goals are or if I want to go back to school. If I were to go back to school, what for? I believe that one day I'd like to be married, have a child and be able to be a stay-at-home mom for a little while until they go to school.

I stop pressuring myself about having family right now as much as my family do. I started to understand myself more than ever.

4807,Work drama with an older adult.,"Hi I'm 24F and an elementary school teacher. I truly do try my best to stay out of drama, I was involved with tons of drama as a stupid college student doing my internship year and have tried my very best at this new(ish) school by staying out of gossip and shit talk. There is this woman (let's call her Diane) who is really abrasive to everyone - makes passive and subtle racist and homophobic comments, criticizes and talks about students in front of other students or even worse in front of said student, just overall really hard for me to get along with (an LGBT, pretty liberal, young person). 

My question is, when is it worth it to speak up? I don't want her to keep saying all these shitty things, and when it offends me, I speak up about it (in the nicest way I can muster - though recently I'm sure I've been coming off as bitchier and bitchier). I'm starting to have an automatic blood-boiling feeling whenever I see her. I avoid her, try not to talk to her, don't go to our shared lunch break in the break room anymore, but she is now talking about me behind my back. I know I've ruined some of my credibility as I have confided with about 4 other teachers who I trust in my frustration even though I'm trying not to stir drama. I don't know what to do, she insults me and my teaching style, mocks my generation and the fact that I'm ""too nice"" and I guess accepting of my students and the changing political climate. It's truly like she just loves clout and is somehow putting my face as the leader of the teacher's who don't like her because I'm the most outspoken of all the other teachers.

I didn't wanna make this post ridiculously long, so if you're actually interested I do have more specific details of said racism/homophobia if people are interested."

I've looked for advice elsewhere and it almost always essentially boils down to ""don't be you"" by saying you have to network or something. I can't do that. Its out of the question. I don't have the soft skills required for networking. People say carpet bomb your resume online. I don't really know what that means when I don't know where to look. I don't get it. I just don't and I'm tired of people just telling me to not be me when asking what I need to do, so I'm posting here hoping to find guidance that is more empathetic. 

I have 6 years of experience in an office job as an computer support analyst (IT).

I have an associates degree in liberal arts. 

That's it. No network. No actionable interests. 

What do I do?"
4878,How am I supposed to get job experience to be hired if no one will hire me in the first place?,"I'm 19, haven't worked a day in my life. Most places have a survey I need to take before even looking at an application questioning mostly job experience or things that would be done on a job like it (Have you ever handled money as a cashier, have you ever done janitorial service at a job, etc.). If you don't answer enough 'yes' you just get locked out of the application.

I've gotten actual interviews too; it's always extremely surprising that I haven't worked yet and then it's a few questions, a smile, a ""We'll call you/email you when we make a decision"" and then silence, even after almost a week calling back several times to find ""we're still working on it"". I'm honestly thinking it comes down to my lack of experience. The problem is, I can't get a job anywhere because it's simply more profitable to pick experienced people over someone new since you don't have to waste the time to train them.

So I don't know what to do anymore. It's horrible just sitting here all day. I'm honestly thinking of just joining the Army at this point because at least they'll take me."
4879,What to do during and after getting your identity stolen?,"I pulled my credit report to do some adulting in the coming week. Better to have one or two inquiries that end in a yes than a couple dozen inquiries that mostly lead to a no.

I guess that updated something, because I got a Discover SSN alert about a new account on my Experian credit report.

I called Discover, got what info they had, and said ""I've never even *seen* a &lt;bank name&gt;, and I don't have anything with just a $200 balance, debt or liquid.""

Discover sent my account and contact info to their fraud department and put a fraud freeze on my credit report. I think that's what the woman called it. 

I just... don't know what to do... is there anything I can do? My coworker that calmed down my initial panic attack told me ""if they figure out who did it, they're gonna ask if you wanna press charges. The answer is yes, no one gets to just...*take* your name."" Beyond that, I'm lost...

Any advice is welcome, I'm 19, I don't know what's going on and I don't know what to do but hide under my covers and cry about it.

Adulting is hard..."
4880,How to figure out what education/career to go for?,"Hi! I'm 21 and don't go to university yet, because I've been doing different stuff for a while and am only now getting ready to actually go. I'm quite lost however, because I really don't know what to go for. I can picture my future and I have different ideas, and I also know what I definitely don't want to do. But I've never been involved in any projects or had any education or jobs that have pushed me more towards one thing than the other. So how would one go about figuring out which degree/career to pursue? How did you figure it out? What would you have done differently? How is your actual life now compared to what you thought when you were younger? etcetc. I would love to hear your stories!

(for context, I would love to do something political, and/or something in culture and to do with art and films. I think. Adulting is hard)"
4883,How to go to the doctor?,"This may seem like a dumb question but I just don't know. I'm 22 and I really want to see a doctor and therapist for some mental health and other issues that I have. I haven't been to any doctor besides school physicals since I was about 12. My work doesn't offer health insurance so I will likely have to pay out of pocket. My question is where do I even start? How do I find the best or at least a good doctor? I don't know any professionals.

Also once I do find someone what do I do? Do I just show up or do I have to setup a meeting?"
4907,Can I ask a pharmacist to check my head for lice?,"I know it's a pretty disgusting thing to ask, but I'm almost sure I don't have any. However a hairstylist today refused to do my hair because she said she found nits in it! I looked myself as best as I could, and had 2 other friends check me too but none of us could see anything suspicious. The thing is, I paid a deposit to the hairstylist and I didn't get it back, instead I was just told to reschedule when I'm sure I don't have anything. So at this point I feel I need a ""professional opinion"" to be able to tell for sure before I can reschedule, but I don't know where I can ask. Since pharmacies sell lice shampoo maybe they can help me there? Is this an acceptable request?"
4924,What are my options? Where do I start?,"I'm (20F) working my first job (part time). My mother got my first job for me (Friend of a Friend situation).I have no money saved (I spend too much). I do not have a car (I have my license). I need a full time job. I don't know ""what I would like to do"" or ""what my strengths are"". I need a job now. The part time job is cutting down my hourly wage and I need money (I need to pay my mother rent).

I feel like more than enough time has been wasted and I'm so tired of being stagnant at this point.

I don't know where to start. What are my options? Are there some websites I can visit? What can I do?"
4944,Have No Money and Traveling to Germany soon for Vacation,"Hey there, 21 M college student here

So heres whats going on with me.
Ive been working since I was 16 and had a great internship this past Summer, but decided to not pursue more work as my Fall Semester started. I enjoyed having more free time and am pleased with how much work I put into my classes this semester which just about ended! Anyway since I didnt continue to work I had no set source of income coming in, so continued to use up my savings leftover.

I currently have about $150 in my bank account and even worse - two credit cards open, one with ~$500, the other with $200.

I tried looking for work too late near end of November, because surprise surprise after lightly mentioning how I'll be free for January since Im not working. my mom then proceeds to buy me a ticket to Germany to visit my uncle. Great but unlike her im someone who likes to plan for things and fell under a great deal of stress due to my financial issues. My mom does try to tell me dont worry that she and my dad will help fund this trip to Germany but im not from the wealthiest of families so I don't know where this ""trip"" money is gonna come from, she told me she bought the ticket on a credit card.

Anyway its to late to get a job, I didnt have the best of luck finding work right away but just recently ive finally been called by someplace like Walgreens. But my trip is three weeks away, why would I start a new job now. I told my mom starting a new job is not an option and slowly have been coming to terms with my stress, my problems are all financial. So im trying to push into selling more of my things from my closet that I dont need, adding up $50s and $20s with everything I sell, trying to get by.

My mom keeps telling me dont worry go have fun, but like how am I gonna have fun when I have no money and my credit cards are sitting there waiting on monthly payments. Its been quite a stressful month for me but anyway my plan is to go enjoy Germany in any way I can, come back and get my fatass a job again so I can more fucking money. This whole experience just makes me more aware of how awful my mom is with money and worst of all, PLANNING. I love to plan ahead, my classmates even are shocked at how organized I am and how clean my room is since ""im a guy"". Its just how I am I guess. 

I absolutely admit when talking to my mom about going to Germany last month I was absolutely excited on the, idea since I barely travel. I wish I had thought things over but instead it was more of my mom going to a travel agency one day, calling me and saying hey theres this amazing deal for Germany! Which was true, it was a pretty good deal within the ~500 range but still. 

I hope to adult better than my parents when im older, being good with money and taking decisions unlike my mom &amp; taking responsibility and not sitting on my arse all day like my dad.

I know im not good with money, thats why I had ~$1000 in June and now $150 in December, but I absolutely admit it. I want to learn to be better, to grow. Unlike my mom who never admits shes wrong because of her ego. I want to learn from my mistakes but anyway, I hope I can scramble up atleast a couple hundred to enjoy with in Germany for 3 weeks, and then I can come back and get my arse another job. 

I call this moment of my life sonicbillymay's Financial Crisis of 2019, 

TLDR: Going to Germany in January, wish I planned this better so I can have money. Instead I dont have money. So I'll round up some change, then get my ass a job when I come back"
4946,How do you even find a therapist?,"The title says it all. Just this year I've finally got my shit together in terms of healthcare- I saw my PCP, saw the dentist after several years, and regularly saw a chiropractor after a bad car accident. My next step is finding a therapist. I should have started seeing one years ago, but in all honestly I've been putting it off because I know it'll be difficult. It's time now though, and I don't know where to start. How do I go about finding the right person? I'm scared because it seems like I might need to see a few different ones before I find the right person and I'm also terrified to open up and address the hard things. If you guys could help explain the process to me or give me some tips I'd be grateful."
4958,PLEASE help me get the pet urine odor out of my apartment carpet,"I have lived in my apartment for the past year and my lease is up for renewal at the end of this month....... I am afraid my landlord isn't going to renew my lease and will force me to move out in 2 weeks unless I can get rid of the pet odor and I don't know what else to try to clean it with because I can't just start ripping up the carpet since its an apartment...

I have 7 ferrets and over the past year they've had a lot of accidents.. I always pick it up and spray the carpet when I see it and I thought that was keeping it controlled but I guess not, it has gotten harder to keep up with because one of my ferrets is elderly and has cancer and goes to the bathroom literally everywhere because he is incontinent, its not his fault he just cant make it to the litter box anymore..

But now the odor has gotten so bad the landlord said you can smell it in the hallway.. I have tried EVERYTHING I can think of to get rid of this odor but no matter what I do even when it seems fine for a few days after I first clean it the odor ALWAYS comes back within a week....

I bought a carpet shampooer and I've used 2 whole bottles of Natures Miracle carpet shampoo on it, I've literally shampood the carpet atleast 10 times in the last month with different products since she complained about the strong odor, it gets rid of the smell for a few days but it comes back...

I've doused the carpet in baking soda multiple times and left it sit over night... I've tried those scented carpet powders from the store... the smell JUST KEEPS COMING BACK.... 

I have a system now where I can keep the odor from reaching the hallway if I shampoo the carpet twice a day, leave my windows cracked slightly, burn candles and incense all day long, and leave a towel shoved under the cracks of the door with some dryer sheets under the door cracks too and put a freshmatic automatic airfresher in the hallway.... but I want the odor to be gone for good, I'm tired of stressing about it and living like this, I'm living with constant anxiety every day that I'm going to wake up to another text from my landlord about the odor or an eviction notice on my door..

4976,How to make my bedroom warmer,"Im renting a duplex, and its currently winter in Minnesota. Our living room, bathroom, and kitchen are all sufficiently warm, but the bedroom is freezing! I thought it was coming from the windows, but I think it's coming from the walls and basically everywhere. I don't think we have hardly any insulation, and I'm not sure what to do. Its all hardwood, I don't know if that influences it at all. Our heating bill is already pretty high. Any recommendations?"
4983,"Thinking about going to uni soon, I have no idea how to do any of this","Hey, I'm an 18 year old student who's currently flip flopping between the idea of taking a year off or just starting uni in late feb. If I went, I'd have to move an hour and a half's plus train away from my hometown - I don't have my driver's licence -  and live in a major city.

That in itself isn't very daunting, but I don't have any friends who are also considering moving and I have no idea to figure out getting some roommates to make the cost of urban-living easier. Additionally I have only five months working in a supermarket deli from a year ago, in terms of work experience, meaning it's going to be much harder for me to get a job *and* I don't have much in terms of savings \~about $500AUD. On campus accomodation is so expensive it's out of the equation.

It's just...I don't know what to do, I've spent months trying to figure out what to do. Should I get all the help I can possibly get and hopefully figure out how to live independently at university or should I take a gap year off to work and save up, even though it'll be extremely boring???"

5005,"I'm having a hard time ""justifying"" my decisions... Advice?","I don't know where I should post about this, but I'm seeking for an advice that could help me with what's been bothering me for so long, so i figured maybe it's better to ask for an advice regarding this, from people who is not really attached to me so there will be no bias opinions or whatsoever.

Im not sure if justifying is really the right term but it's more like whenever i do something or make a decision for something.. Im always having a hard time figuring out if i did the right thing or the bad thing, if that makes sense. 

I'm not sure if I'm being too soft or too arrogant. 
Im not sure if I'm being selfless or selfish. 
I'm not sure if I'm being true or just being mean. 

For example, I came from a kinda conservative culture, where we believe family is family no matter what... My parents raised us expecting that we'll study and work to get them off from poverty something like that, I've been really honest since day 1 about what i feel about this and as i grew older I showed them what my stand about a lot of stuff, i know that they don't really agree with me. I can feel it.. Im a believer that parents shouldn't really expect children to work for them and provide money for them but my family thinks the opposite..

I feel bad because maybe I'm too honest to them sometimes that i think they have a hard time approaching me for help. So i just do my move and offer my help to them so they would feel comfortable. 

But after that they will just keep asking for more  which is the part that annoys me. I just don't want them to feel that they can't count on me if they need help.. Its not only my family that im having hard time like this,friends too...

I don't know where to set the line/boundaries /limitations. I don't know when is enough.

Someone there can give me an advice?"

The document details the percentage of the deduction and how it will be invested over time. I am NOT a full time worker so I don't know how I even qualify for a retirement savings. The reason I'm here is because I want to make sure nothing fishy is happening and whether I should opt to not do it. The questions I have are..

1. Will I be able to keep my savings if I change employers?

2. If I choose not to opt into it, can I still start one in the future?

3. The document stated the investments are not FDIC insured, is this something to be concerned about?

I need help. I've been living independently from my parents from almost a year now. It has been going perfectly well. I can take responsibility it seems and can solve day to day problems with ease. Mostly.

Lately I started a diet to accompany my gym routine. My diet has chicken. And what I usually do before I cook my chicken breast, is that I would cut off all the bloody bits and the excess fat and throw it in the trash.

This however has led to the meat going bad in the trash and attracting a metric fuck ton of tiny flies. It's getting really annoying and I don't know what I could do to stop this. 

I tried wrapping the chicken bits in a paper towel before I dump them in the trash but that hasn't helped much either. Any tips appreciated. Thank you."
5285,How to fill out a W-4,"First job, please be gentle

I'm trying to figure out if I am ""exempt from withholding"". I tried to use the flowchart on

""For 2018, did you have a right to a refund of ALL federal income tax withheld because you had NO tax liability?""

What is this asking me? I did not have a job last year. I am single and am 17, so I think that means I am dependent on my mother and she can claim me as such. I also will make 8 dollars an hour from 9:30-6:+15 PM, and I will work on weekends, meaning 64 dollars a day times 2 equals 128 dollars a week, right?

I thought it might have been a popped knee, but my kneecap is still in place. a friend says it's most likely hyperextension.

I went to bed after icing the knee, hoping it would be better in the morning. currently it still hurts, and I'm having trouble standing due to the injury. I already called last night to my job to give them a heads up about it, saying I don't know if it'll be better by then.

I need to see a doctor ASAP before this gets worse, but I'm genuinely scared I won't be able to afford treatment, and I don't want to miss work because tomorrow was my only day off, and I work the rest of the week, and I don't want to be calling out more than necessary.

I don't have insurance of any kind, so I'm really unsure if I can afford a checkup, but I really need to see a doctor.

how do I set up an appointment, and how much would it most likely cost?"
5428,How to move out...,"I have a good chunk of savings and recently got my Bachelors; I've worked full time throughout college (bartending/waitressing) and I can't deal with living with my parents anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, I don't know the first thing about moving! I live in NYC where rent is outrageous and I really don't want to live with roommates. I was debating holding out until I have a professional job and could perhaps get a condo or something instead of pissing away money to rent each month, but I definitely want to move out soon. Any advice guys?"
5436,What Square Footage / Rent Price / # of Bedrooms is appropriate for a recent college graduate?,"So I'll be working in Texas either as an emergency first responder or an Emergency Room Technician. I believe the average salary in Texas for both those jobs are around 33,000-36,000 dollars full time. I believe I can afford maybe 1000-1200 dollars rent per month. If I stretch it I could probably pay up to 1400 dollars max. I'll be living alone.

&amp;#x200B;

Texas has pretty low rent costs and is overall very cheap to live in so I could probably find a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment in Houston for 1000-1200 dollars with about 800-1.2k square footage. I'll be living in this apartment for at least 2 years, possibly 3. 

&amp;#x200B;

My living space is very important to me and ideally I'd want to live in a big place so I'd rather go for the 1000+ square footage, but many of those options are 2 bedroom 2 bathrooms instead. What I'm wondering is if this is normal for people who just got out of college. I live in a 550 sqft studio apartment right now (I want to upgrade to a place that has a bedroom) in California where the rent is like 2000 dollars, so a place that's twice the size of my current place for half the price seems like an incredible deal. But I just can't conceptualize in my mind how big a 1000 sq ft apartment would be. If I had 2 bedrooms, I'll probably use one of them as a study space where I can read, work on my music projects, study for possible graduate school exams, etc. which sounds great. But at the same time idk if a 1000 sq ft apartment would be too unnecessarily luxurious for a 22 year old. 

&amp;#x200B;

Would it be better for me to go a bit cheaper and get a 750-800 sq ft apartment for 800-900 bucks? Pros are that it would save me 200-300 bucks a month. Cons are that a big part of me moving to Texas is so that I can live in a larger place (my home is very important to me and I really like large living spaces) with a cheaper price, and I don't know if 750-800 sq ft is enough to satisfy that. Again I can't really accurately conceptualize how big or small a 750-800 sq ft apartment would be. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess what I'm asking is (tl;dr):

&amp;#x200B;

How big exactly is a 750-800 sq ft apartment space? How big is a 1000 sq ft apartment space? Would it be worth it to pay 1000-1200 dollars a month to get the 1000 sq ft apartment space or is 800-900 dollars for a 750-800 sq ft apartment more than enough already?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance."
5487,"Moved 7 months ago, I'm very lonely and really just at a loss for what my present and future holds.","There's a lot that goes into this, and I (F 19) really just don't know what to do any more. A tragic family event happened last year that left me basically homeless and with some pretty severe PTSD. I missed my last week of high school, my two graduations, my summer job, lost out on the opportunity of going to college, and probably the biggest hitter was I lost my grandpa who was a father figure to me for 15 years of my life, and my cousin both at the same time. Everything would of been okay if I didn't get kicked out by my abusive grandmother (grandfather's wife) who had custody of me. (Event happened 5-10-2018 - got kicked out after I turned 18 on the 12th of may). 

My GF let me move in with her a few weeks later, but she was still living with her parents. Between grieving my grandfather, losing everything, the trauma, and my whole life falling apart I fell into one of the worst depressions I've ever been in. 3 months later and my state getting worse I ended things with her, packed a few trashbags and bounced from place to place. My grandmother opened her house back up to me but I wasn't able to handle the abusive tendencies coming back, so I gathered my stuff up once more after reaching out to the only person I really had left.

In November of 2018 My brother (21) offered me a place to stay in Pennsylvania which was where I was born and was put into foster care before I got placed in Ohio. With options short I took the chance packed up my car and took the 9 hour drive from Ohio to his house in PA. I arrived 2 days before Thanksgiving. I instantly was wondering if I made the right choice. It was a small studio apartment (him and his gf lived in). Not clean, mouse crap everywhere, just not a clean and healthy place, also in a very very bad area crime rate wise. Keep in mind I lived in a small farming town and I moved to an area with a county population of 1.1 million. While I tried to relax and keep in mind I can build myself up and make a home for myself if I work hard small things started showing through.

I started talking to a guy on tinder and we hit it off, he was sweet and we had a lot of good times together. I don't like saying we got serious fast, but we got serious fast. Within 3 weeks I was staying at his house and his moms house more than I was at my brothers apartment. This started causing issues between my brother and I. I figured out he was back on cocaine and lost his job, and his license. I gave him over $1500 because they were about to lost the apartment which I still haven't seen a penny back of after momths and months of different plans. Tensions were constantly on the rise and it ended up to the point where I was only there once a week. I packed my shit up once more and left and moved in with my BF and his mom temporarily. About 3 weeks later after getting a job and his mom agreeing to be a co-signer I got my first studio apartment at the end of March.

I was thrilled. Even though I needed a cosigner I was self completely self sufficient and I have a home for the next year, things started to really look up, I was genuinely happy.
Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Things are taking a turn for the worst again. My brother is severely addicted again. Got held at gunpoint and called me right after. I can't get how shakey his voice was out of my head, (which is screwing with my ptsd and nightmares) and is actively destroying his relationship and it's falling back on me. They're asking for month long stays which I can't risk because their names aren't on the lease. 
Out of pure frustration I went off on my brother. Nothing crazy was said, just that I was at a loss and with everything going on I can't mentally handle everything as bad as I felt.. and I blocked him. He sent me a text (one thing I forgot to block him on) essentially telling me ""Wish I never bought you out here"" telling me that if anything happens to my ""Fa**ot worthless boyfriend not to come crawling back"" because I spit in his face and I'm the most inconsiderate heartless person he's ever met.

I'm working 40 hrs full time a week as an IT contractor with no option for over time and people keep getting cut off left and right and I have no idea if I'm next. I've been applying to places with no word back except one job that would leave me off worse. I live paycheck to paycheck and have virtually no money to fall back on. I just got food poisoning or something last week.. but it turned into some insane chest pains and tightness the next day. It felt like I was being stabbed in the chest and I could barely get a 3rd of a normal breath in. I had no insurance and thought I was completely out of luck I kept getting turned away. My boyfriend's mom took me to a charity ER and after an ecg, chest xray, blood tests, and other lab tests everything came back fine and they told me it's just anxiety. They offered me a shot for it but i turned it down, I just wanted to go home and sleep. 

I've had major depressive episodes and a history of mental health issues but never really thought it was that bad. I need to get back into therapy but with no insurance it's making it impossible. I contacted the Children and Youth for the county I was a foster kid through (I live in the county next to it currently) but no one is returning my calls, and I can't miss work but my work hours are the only days they are open. I figured they would be able to give me guidance or help me out because I should qualify for some sort of state insurance or assistance or something. So that's one thing on my plate right now, this large bill I'm going to have if i can't get this figured out.

My boyfriend is going to college over 3 hours away mid August, and that is also starting to really hit me. I got attached very fast which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I have 0 friends. I know absolutely no one in this area or know how to go about making friends in ways that doesn't cost.. again I'm broke. 

I'm already struggling with the idea of not having him around that much any more.. he's really been my rock the past 7 months. I cannot give that man enough credit for all he has done for me. I've never loved anyone as much as I love him. I try to keep in mind he has friends and a social life and is trying to get time in with his friends and family and work before he goes but I'm very lonely and very worried about how I'm going to handle not having him around.. or if him and I will even be able to keep this relationship going and healthy with him being so far away. That, and the fact that when he goes to college I have absolutely no one again and I don't want to feel that again.

My future is just starting to look really bad again and I need help with figuring something out in the next 2 months, or I really don't know what I'm going to do or how I'm going to handle this. I'm so so fucking sad and lost, and all of what I'm going on about now isn't even the half of it. I'm tired of beind sad and depressed, but I can't escape it any more."

5579,replacing vacuum filter?,"so about a year ago I bought a ""pelonis electric broom"" at ocean state job lot for $20. [image](https://i.imgur.com/nDdOioR.jpg)

the filter it came with is very gross now. i have been trying to clean it using a toothpick. I am not sure how the filter effects the vacuum's ability exactly but i don't think it's working as well as it used to. the problem is I don't know where to get a replacement. searching ""pelonis electric broom"" returns nothing on amazon. should I just buy a new vacuum? my local ocean state job lot no longer has them and I am not doing well financially and $20 was a fantastic deal for a vacuum that works decently well and is very compact. I have looked at amazon's selection of replacement HEPA filters and none look like they would fit, i think the shape is proprietary.

if there isn't a way to replace or clean this filter do you have any recommendations for a better compact vacuum to save up for?"
5580,"Lots of PTO, not allowed to use it.","I'm 25 in my first full time job with benefits.  One of these benefits is paid time off - annual leave and sick leave.

At my old job (same profession, but I was part time and expectations were different) the culture was encouraging of taking ""mental health days"" for ""self care"" as often as needed - and man, people did.  I work in higher ed, you see.  At this current job, I get a LOT of PTO, but people never call off.  Scheduling days off in advance is okay, but taking sick days more than once in a great while is very much discouraged.

I feel a bit stuck here.  I'm afraid to take sick days when I need them (I deal with some mental health issues that make my very people-oriented job difficult on bad days).  My boss has not given me any of the supervision or mentorship I thought I'd get in this position - he barely talks to me at all.  Therefor I am unclear what the expectation is.

I'm not sure how to handle this.  I got in some hot water because I woke up Monday morning with a bad migraine that lasted all day, so I had to take a sick day.  My boss said ""okay"", but later I found out he was pissed about it.  He does not address issues or communicate problems, and he dances around confrontation.  This results in a very passive-aggressive supervisor, and I'm learning that is not the style of supervision for me.

I'm not saying I need to take a sick day every couple weeks.  But I don't know what the expectations are, and when I talk to my boss, he acts like a chill party dude until things actually happen.

How should I navigate this?  Talking to him directly is ineffective.  Also feels strange to feel bad about taking sick time when I earn so damn much of it."

Everything was simple and I coasted through life until the end of college without a care in the world.

Now I'm bombarded with opportunities, paths, and options and I am mentally exhausted from trying to make decisions and figuring things out. People keep telling me ""just let it go and be in this moment"" but it just doesn't work like that for me no matter how hard I try. (I have GAD, which may be contributing to this).

I just want everything to stop and I'd much rather just have all responsibilities and decisions disappear into a myst while I watch disney movies and do something creative in my room at my parents' house. 

My husband is the polar opposite of me, always working hard and happy and never complaining about anything. My increasingly foul attitude towards life is grating on him a lot. 

I'm so fucking tired. Am I lazy? am I depressed? I don't know anymore. I've spent the last 2 years trying to ""mature"" myself and adjust to adult life but it's just not happening. I feel myself growing more miserable every day even though I have ALL the reasons to be on cloud nine."

For context, my previous job was in 100% commission direct sales role and I made really good money. This is why I'm so confused and apprehensive about doing anything other than sales, is because I'm so good at it that it feels like my calling. However, I've always been (mostly) antisocial outside of work since I started in sales over 10 yrs ago. 

As I sit here now I think about going back to work or finding a new sales job in another sector and I just can't bring myself to it. I cant tell if I should be doing something different, the idea of not being in sales is scary to me. I feel like it's part of my identity.

We own a trailer home (bought cheap to save money for a real house) and just bought our second car together (thus the conversation, we bought a  station wagon for the space and the salesman asked if we were planning on children).

My whole life I've been sheltered because I ""wasn't capable of doing anything at my age"". They never let me take the bus and trains on my way to a far place because I would either get lost, robbed, or harassed. They never let me wash my clothes or do any other chores because they can do it on their own. They never let me find a part time job because they can give me cash if I asked for it.

They never let me do ANYTHING. I've been handheld and spoon-fed throughout my whole life. When I ask to be taught a certain thing, they would always tell me that I have to wait till I'm older.

I said I'm not doing anything art related anymore and I'm working on a new career in healthcare.

Then he asks about the connections I had and if I have any in Chicago. (I lived there for about two years before moving back home to Missouri.) I said I haven't spoken to any of those people since 2016, and even if, they didn't exactly make a difference career wise.

Then he starts whining about how nothing is going good, which at this point, I was getting exhausted talking to him.

I said ""Look. I don't know what to tell you or what you want me to do. I have nothing to help you with. We knew the risks for this career field. If it's not working, try something else.""

Then he goes on a rant about how I'm selling out to the system, or me being a disappointment, or some bullshit. I just didn't care at that point and hung up.

Basically, he was calling me to cry about how his career/life isn't working, and expected me to give him false reassurance via ""potential"" jobs. Not only did I tell him that my preferences changed, but the truth about the career field we chose to pursue. He clearly didn't like to hear it, so I just didn't humor him any further.

I just live in an apartment near my parent's house and pay my own utilities, never asked for money from them ever since I started earning. 

I felt the need to help my parents financially since they had really bad financial problems due to lack of planning for a sustainable budget. I offered to pay the house's electric bill, the allowance money for my two younger sisters who are still in high school, and maintenance medicine for my autistic sister. My older sister also helps by paying the house's water bill and half of the budget for our family car loan.

However, my mother still tries to borrow money from both my sister and I. She always tells us she needs it to pay for the groceries and for some car repairs (she works as a family driver). Worse part, she promises to pay it back but she never does. We just got used to it and never asked her when she could pay us back since she would just tell us she doesn't have enough money yet. Meanwhile, my father only earns enough money to pay for the other expenses and he owes money to some of my relatives too so he also has to pay them back  

In the first place, I volunteered to pay those expenses I mentioned since I know my mother has this tendency of constantly borrowing money from me and my elder sister   since we were in high school (we try to save money as much as we can from allowance and she knows we have the money so she borrows them and never paid it back).

I honestly don't know how to deal with her since I feel like I already pay enough contribution to help them and I have my personal budget too. When she keeps borrowing money, my savings are constantly decreasing since that's the only part of my budget where I could get money to lend her.

It's part of the Asian culture to have this sense of gratitude to your parents once you already earn money. But I'm honestly stressed about it, since I want to keep my personal budget in place and my mother constantly borrowing money doesn't help. At the same time, I feel like I would be too selfish if I stopped lending her money.


I want to hear honest opinions. I'm a little overwhelmed right now."
5899,Taxes,"I cannot agree to the taxation amount and where the money is being spent as a us citizen. I don't know what my options are, either I pay and get to continue on with my life in the us or don't pay and try to find a different country. I'm a pilot so getting citizenship to another country shouldn't be an issue. I love the us but I can't stand them in essence stealing from the citizens and calling it justice. Is there anyway for the people to just not pay these ridiculous taxes until the government stops giving away our time and money?"
5944,Ever since I've gotten a salary I feel like I blow money super carelessly.,"I just need some other opinions here. Or a reality check.

Rundown: I guess you can say I've never been in a tight money situation. I started working when I was 16 and have consistently been working since then, having multiple jobs throughout college. My parents still supported me so most of my money either went to food, alcohol or weed. I saved some, plus $3000 after my high school graduation and $4,000 after college graduation, I had $11,000 saved up. Then I spent about $3,500 on furniture and other various things for my new apartment. That left me about $6,000. I now make $1400 every two weeks at my new job. Currently still have $6,000 in savings. I don't have any outstanding debts/loans.

So here's the thing. I spend money super carelessly. Because I feel like I don't know how much I should have, and I've always had thousands of dollars to fall back on, so what does it matter if I spend an extra $20 on food today or go on two $500-$1000 vacations in a span of a month because $1,000 isn't that much compared to $6,000, plus I'm making it back with my paychecks now? And I have a ~credit card?~

I guess I need to know, is this normal? I've only been working a couple months so maybe I'm just ""carried away"" and reality will hit me like a ton of bricks soon enough. But is anyone else in the same boat? Have you had trouble saving money? How much should I have saved at 22?"
5964,Being charged an overdraft interest of 0.01??,"Hi,

I'm a college student, and tbh don't know much about money. I got my first debit card in high school and bc I was under 18 they made it as a joint acc with my mom. Anyway I don't really use that card anymore, bc I work part time now and have my own credit and debit card with another bank.

However, to keep track of my spending I do deposit like a 100 bucks into that debit card at times like once a month, and I'll have that as my budget for getting coffee, going out, commuting.

Anyway hadn't used that card in a while.. (so wasnt etransferring money into it) ...but then one day I only had that card with me and I had to pay for something that was like 35 bucks when I had 37 bucks on my card....and I was like I should etransfer money into this card later, but then forgot about it cause I dont use it.

Now Im using it again and noticed something that said ""**overdraft interest**"" of 0.01 in my recent transactions... then I checked back on my transactions cause I was confused and saw that I was charged a service charge fee by the bank back when I only had those 2 bucks making it like $-3.50 ....

Anyway I have like 200 bucks on the card again, am I ok? Do I need to call the bank or do something? I don't really get what the overdraft interest is and tried googling for a long time and was still confused... don't want to do something that'll mess up my credit in the future."
5983,"Health insurance paid out, hospital still sending more bills.","I'm stuck in a back and forth between my health insurance and the hospital whose ER I visited when my throat closed up. My health insurance paid out ~$1000 for the visit, and told me that I am responsible for a $100 copay and nothing more. The hospital says that my insurance only paid ~$1000 of the ~$6000 bill and keeps trying to bill me for the remaining $5000. I sent the claim to my insurance, they denied it and reaffirmed that I am responsible for nothing more than the copay. The hospital sent a second bill, this time showing my insurance rejected the claim, stating I had 1 week to pay the bill. I contacted my insurance again and they told me the same exact thing. I called the hospital telling them exactly what my insurance company told me, and they said that if I don't pay the bill, they'll send it to collections. What's even more annoying is the call center hours for both the hospital and my insurance company are during my work hours, so each time I call, I have to be on hold for 30 minutes to an hour when I should be working. I don't know if there's anything I can even do about this, other than dump my savings into my medical bill."
6013,"1 year of working, but I feel like things are bad..","(ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE, SORRY IF WHAT I WROTE IS CONFUSING)

I started my first job almost a year ago right after graduating from college (I'm 21 now). At first I thought I was gonna be fine and that I could handle it, but it turns out that I can't. A lot of times, I felt like asking for help from my coworkers, but when I do, it would seem like what I'm asking is something I should know by now. There are also times where I feel like they say one thing then say another thing that's completely different and I get confused on what to do next. There were also some instances that were completely out of my control but I still got scolded for it. Its gotten to the point wherein I get anxious about every little thing I do at work, but I can't ask for help because I'm afraid of the scolding. The anxiety makes me dread going to work and low-key hoping I get fired just so I can stop worrying about everything.

 I know I have to be more mature and responsible, but I honestly am trying to do the best I can, but there is just so much going around that I don't know what to do sometimes. 

Do you guys think I should just try to make my situation better or just quit and find a new job? Or just any advice on how I can handle adulting life better?"

I now see in retrospect that i've passed so many red flags in the past. For starters, the day i met the polish, nor them nor my aunt(my supposed Supporting Adult) talked about basics, like explaining the reason for the price and how the apartment complex works, how the bills will be split when i have vacations where i'm not on the apartment for weeks (because apparently they live here, i thought that on vacations they left to Poland or something but nope. they stay here just using THAT ELECTRICITY), and i have made some mistakes myself because after christmas holidays the bill where i WASN'T in town was like 20€ extra, and i didn't said anything. i honestly don't feel like i have an actual responsible adult to explain those things to me, that basically leaves me in a very vulnerable position to be taken advantage of, my parents are no help, i could call my mom but her way of dealing with problems it's just flee every time a problem arises and my father response is just ""can't talk, i'm working"" so, also the fact that i live in a whole new country where i don't know people, the average costs of anything and i mean this is ridiculous. i don't feel like i have any direction,  this whole situation is ridiculous and in retrospect the way i've managed things has just let me to more chaos, i feel so betrayed for all the adults in my family for not teaching me shit."

I study law with French meaning my education is split over two departments. Whilst the teachers in the French dept know me really well (smaller dept., same teachers every year), the masters that I'm applying for are more law-based (I'm thinking international relations, defence, diplomacy etc.). 

As such, I figure that it makes more sense for me to put down members of the law school as a reference. However, most classes are large lectures, the staff who teach me change every semester, and I have little actual contact with those who teach me. 

I submitted a dissertation this year, so considered putting down my supervisor but I've only actually met with him twice. I also have an advisor of studies, but during my 5 years have never met with him so he doesn't really know what I'm like.

6261,Tips for Air travel,"So I just had this conversation with my younger brother and thought I share it here too.

Air travel can be intimidating, but it isn't hard, especially if you take a few steps to make it easier.

Checking in:

This is pretty strait forward. First, be sure to arrive at least an hour before your flight. Boarding usually starts about 20-30 minutes before take-off. If it's a big airport maybe get there 1.5 hours sooner,, and 2 hours for an international flight. Go to the check in desk for the Airline you are flying with. If you are going with multiple airlines go with the one you are flying on first. Almost all airports now have kiosks where you can do most of your check in. You can just just swipe a debit or credit card and it will bring up your info. If you need to check a bag or suitcase instead of carrying it on the plane after checking in you'll be sent to an agen. Have the tickets the machine gave you and an ID ready. Driver's license is fine, but if you are going international you'll need your passport. If they don't do it already you can ask and they'll point you at which direction to go.

Security

I don't know why, but people freak out over this. This is also where the most hold up is to be found. You'll wait in line a bit and then have to show a TSA Agent your boarding pass and ID. They'll make a few marks on your pass and then move to the scanners. 

At this point you are going to have to take off your shoes, belt or suspenders, and empty everything in your pockets into a big tray. Yes, your cell phone is going too. If you have a laptop or tablet in your carry-on bag it needs to come out and go in a tray. There is usually someone there telling people this over and over. Yet people still want to fight and argue. They always lose. Don't fight with the TSA, you will absolutely lose. 

It may be rediculous, but you will not get to keep the water bottle you brought from home to save money. Or a can of soda, big bottle of hand sanitizer, that pocket knife your grandfather gave you, none of it. I've seen so many things get taken and lost a few myself. I once lost a multi-tool knife I had since I was 15, carried it through two deployments, and many jobs. Just missed it when I packed my carry-on. They will offer you the opportunity to go put it in your car, sent it in the mail or put it in luggage, but this may not be a possibility for you. So be sure to check your bags carefully. Once on the scanner you will go through a metal detector. You may have to get a pat down there. It's not uncommon to miss a coin or a key or something in your pockets. If they are not, you can request that the person patting you down is the same sex as you. Don't ask for someone of the same race, I've seen that go poorly. 

You may also have to get your bags checked. It's not a big deal. You'll be asked to open the bag and perhaps remove some contents. If they tell you something isn't allowed you'll be given some options as mentioned earlier, but don't fight it. If you do want to go out to your car or whatever you'll have to come back through security. 

After you're done there you can put on your shoes, fill your pockets and go to your gate.

Going to the gate

This easy, just follow the signs. You may have to travel by tram to different parts, like in Denver they have 3 main concourses (A, B, and C) then numbered gates within. So if your gate is B23 you take the tram to concourse B, the follow the signs to gate 23. Minneapolis is laid out more in a horseshoe shape, they use letters and numbers and you just have to follow the signs to get there. There are also maps all around.

If you are at a bigger airport you'll probably have some shops and restaurants you can go into. Medium airports will have an A La Carte style shoppette with a few basic things, and small airports might have some vending machines. Prices will be marked up a little but its really not too bad. If you want to get some better food or some drinks for the flight its not a bad idea.

Boarding and flying

Unless its a smaller plane, you will board in groups. Parents with small children, the disabled, and people who need extra time or assistance (like the very elderly) will go first. The the higher class passengers like first or business class passengers. The rest of us economy peasants are broken into 3-5 groups. Your boarding group is on your pordind pass, you can board anytime after your group but if you try to go before you'll get turned away.

Once on the plane you can find your seat. There are little diagrams at every row telling you what the row number is and which seat is which. If you are a bit on the bigger side you can ask for a seatbelt extension if you need it. You won't be able to recline your seat or use the tray until after you are up in the air. More planes have entertainment systems on them now and should have at least something you'll enjoy. 

Depending on they length of your flight you'll at least get a quick service with drinks and snacks like nuts, pretzels, or cookies. Longer flights will offer a meal, you'll have 2 or 3 choices (one of which is vegetarian). There might also be an opportunity to buy better food or premium drinks like alcohol. 

Layovers

If you have a stop on the way you may not have your next gate on your boarding pass. But there are usually big screens that have that information. Look under departures and look for the city you are flying to, then look at the flight number (its on the boarding pass). If you are having trouble you can ask a gate agent and they can look it up. There is also a possibility you'll have to move to a different terminal and go through security again. At Denver you don't have to, but in Boston you do.

Arrival

Once you get to your destination its pretty simple, if you are traveling internationally you'll go through border control and customs. Its pretty simple, you'll show your passport and answer a few questions about your plans and maybe about what you have in your luggage.its not a big deal. From there you go to baggage claim. If you are not flying international you just go strait to baggage claim. There are screens that have the flight number and where it came from, usual over the carousel. It might take a few minutes for luggage to start coming out. Once it does you wsit for your stuff, grab it and leave the airport. 

Few extra tips:

-Dress comfortably, I get hot easily so I usually wear light loose layers. My wife is the opposite and usually brings a hoodie. 

-plan your carry-on. Bring medicine you need of course. But if it is liquid try to get individual packets. You can get small packets of drink mixes too. A tablet can be a good way to entertain yourself on a flight, as well as a book that doesn't need to be turned off during take off and landing. Pack charging cables too. I also reccomend battery packs for charging electronics on the plane. They are super handy and worth the money to get one that holds more charge.

-prep for security. Wear shoes that are easy to remove, but are comfortable. I usually stick my keys in my carry-on bag until I return home. And I try to have as little in my pockets as possible. I try to basically just drop everything in the bin and move forward as quick as possible. Then when I'm through I can grab my stuff and throw on my shoes all in 2 minutes and be on my way.


Upgrades

If you have never flown first class or business class on a decently long flight (2+ hours) I gotta tell you, its awesome. It can also be very expensive. There are some nice perks like  boarding the plane first and decorating first. Your luggage comes out first. Plus the seats are way nicer and you get better service, food, and drinks on the flight included. 

You can of course by your ticket for that class, but this is the most expensive way. You can buy a regular ticket and upgrade it, this is often much less expensive. Sometimes the price goes down if you upgrade when you check in. Don't be afraid to ask if an upgrade is available and how much it would be.

If you travel a lot you can get on a frequent flyer program and with a high enough tier you will get free upgrades."
6278,Should I tell my parents i'm getting perscribed anxiety medication,"My parents typically  focus on my younger sisters mental health issues but when it comes to me I should ""grow up"" and deal with it like and adult, on my own. Im 22 and I recently went to the Doctors for anxiety and other health related issues. All my parents know is that I went for other health related issues. I am on their insurance, which im grateful for so I took it upon myself to get myself back on track and fix my crippling non functioning anxiety. This is a huge step for me considering I personally don't like taking medications. 

Whenever I bring up my mental health issues and want to seek help they always give me the excuse that its too much, and make me feel like I'm the one that breaks the bank. But they'll go the extra mile for my sisters and money is no issue with them. So right now I don't know if I should tell them,  bc I feel like I broke the bank on their insurance...I didnt,  but I feel like I did something horribly wrong and the last thing I want to do is hurt them

6297,How to tell my family friends I want to move out,"I (19F)  recently got into a huge fight with my close family friends (a wife, husband, and child my age) who I've been living with through college. Basically when things got heated they told be I needed to move out. They've been so generous and kind letting me live there for nearly nothing in rent and I can't understate how appreciative I am off it, but these fights are frequent. Our personalities just clash, especially with the wife. I find the environment extremely stressful and it's affecting my schoolwork and overall happiness. 

Last night I talked to the wife and we really had a good discussion. We talked about the things we both need to fix. Things have cooled down and I'm not really sure if I'm still expected to move out and to be honest I'm not sure I want to stay even if she took back what she said. I don't know how to tell her this especially when a huge part of our talk ended up being about finances and saving money and I'm saving a lot living with them. I don't want to hurt their feelings or ruin the relationship by saying I want to leave but I'm afraid of the continued fights will ruin it more. By saying I want to leave I feel like I'm also saying I don't want to fix what we both talked about. I also need to focus on school and it's been difficult for me to do that living there. I know when I bring it up they'll just say I'll be wasting money or I should just push through it and save the money. How should I tell them I don't want to stay?"
6310,how do apartments' pet deposit/pet rent typically work?,"planning to adopt a cat when i'm fully settled into my new place, but my best friend has also asked if i can take care of her cat while she's moving back with her parent for a short while and offered to pitch in for stuff like her cat's food and litter, which i'm very down to do. the thing is, i don't know if pet deposits/rent are on a by-pet basis. so like, if a place lists $30 pet rent and a $200 pet deposit, for instance, would having that second cat cost an extra $200 flat and total $60 per month? or just the deposit and stay at $30? or something else? I love my friend, but i'm not covering all that extra for her if it'll add on to my rent for who knows how many months T_T"
6356,"24, autistic and trans. Complete failure in life","long post incoming

I don't know what to do anymore. All I want is to be a girl. To do that, I need to move out. I can't move out because I'm autistic. My mother is my rep payee and manages my social security. My only two forms of income are the social security and my 200 something check I get at work. I work part time in an office building, taking temperatures because of the pandemic. If it wasn't for the pandemic I wouldn't have a job. I want to move out, but I hate that everything involved with that has some form of risk. Lose your job? Enjoy being homeless! Don't pay a bill? Fuck you! No water. I don't know how to do any of these things. I don't know how taxes work, I don't even know how to file a tax return. Why do we even do tax returns if tax is automatically deducted from my paycheck? I was never taught these things. 

I fucking hate my job, if it was up to me I'd be on hormones, living on my own, in a stable and supportive area. I don't know what I want to do for a career, before this job every job I had I would walk out and quit. I hated retail with a burning passion. It made me more suicidal than I am now. I even tried killing myself when I worked in retail. Twice. I don't know what I want to do. All I know is I like people. It has to be something involving team work and that pays a living wage. 

My parents do not support me at all, the minute I mention my gender identity, their entire demeanor changes, they go from a smile on their face to a frown which I know is a problem. I don't know what to do anymore, I've posted on multiple subreddits before asking for help. I don't know what to do.

6378,How to get an apartment that is over 50% of my income?,"I'm looking at apartments in a very expensive area. I can go to surrounding counties and rent is $200 cheaper, but I would be spending more than $300 more a month on gas, maintenance, and insurance. I could also earn another $300-400 an month in the time spent commuting to work. In total, living in the poor counties would actually cost me about $500 more a month before factoring in all the other downsides (more expensive internet bill, renters insurance, and crime).

I can qualify to rent in the poor areas with my income, even though it is overall more expensive and I can't afford it, but can't in the rich area that I can afford. I also have no renting history or credit. I do have enough money in savings to pay a year's rent out pocket, but I don't know if that is a good idea."

Can anyone give advice on how i could party like it was 2010 in the 2020s? Lol or am i just being extremely irrational?
6386,No happy birthday,"Tomorrow is my birthday and I'm not happy. It's my last day being 21 and I've been wasting my life doing absolutely nothing. Nothing. For years I've been staying in the room, laying down, reading comics, repeating this cycle for years, just doing absolutely nothing to grow up. Everyone my age is living and yet I'm barely existing. I wish I were a college kid, at least I'd be doing something beneficial for my life but maybe it's not meant to be. I can't. I don't know. I feel stuck in my shy, loner self. I never go out, I never do things. I don't know anybody and I just wish I were different. It sucks because everyday I'm forced to deal with evil people and only if I weren't wasting my life, I could've been somewhere else right now. Working, saving money, adulting, being independent, and wouldn't have to deal with anyone threatening me. I wouldn't have to feel anxious everytime I hear a door opening and fear that someone will attack me. Instead, I'm stuck. I'm dependent. I want out. I'm ready to grow up but idk where to start. I wish I could go to college. I wish I knew what it's like. I wish I would fit in somewhere, do something, know something. I don't know. All I know is that I'm just getting older and I don't want to waste my life doing nothing anymore."
6403,(18M) am i making the right choice?,"So I'm a high school student and I'm about to register for welding classes at my local community college. For the past month i had to wait until they had funding so i can get a scholorship. Now it's finally happening. My classes start on the 30th of this month. I was about to give up hope on trying to do welding but now i can finally do classes. But my problem is i don't know how i can juggle all of these responsibilities. Hear me out: i am also thinking about joining the Ameri corps. It's a gap year program for 18-24 y/o. I'm thinking of doing that in the summer time. By then i want my welding classes to be done and over with. Because you can't do Ameri corps and take college classes at the same time. But i feel like I'd be coming off as disingenuous if i don't take a welding job right after i finish my welding classes. After that i want to break out into ameri corps. In this program i can travel and meet new people and also work by doing disaster relief, beautification projects, rebuilding homes etc. So is it bad that i don't want to utilize my welding skills as soon as i finish?"
6406,Help! How do I move?,"Hi all! My last post here was asking advice on timing of job/housing searches when relocating and your answers helped me out a lot! I found the perfect place to live. 

Now the issue is moving everything from Chicago to Denver. Is there a cheap way to move about a vans' worth of goods? Any companies you'd recommend?

My car is a 2016 Nissan sentra, so I don't think towing anything will be a possibility and I'd prefer not to have to drive a uhaul towing my car, and it would be so much easier to hire movers but I really don't know where to start. I have 2 end tables, 2 table lamps, 1 bookcase that's maybe7x4, 1 bookcase maybe 3x5, 15-20 boxes of clothes, books, etc. 

Does anyone have any experience moving cross-country using movers? Did you do it a different way? Trying to pick the most cost-effective option. 

Any input helps 🙂"

6436,"Moving Out: Anxiety, Motivation &amp; Difficult Situations","Hey everyone!

I've been thinking a lot lately about spreading my wings. There is obviously a lot of pros and cons when it comes to such a ""life changing"" decision right? I was hoping to be able to share my situation and look for advice from people who have already succeeded!

**Who I am:** First of all, i'm from Ireland! I'm also 21 years old. I have never attended any higher level education and i'm currently working part-time as a customer assistant in a store! I live in Dublin where requirement of living is nearly impossible for a person of my age with so little experience. My story leading up to this point is quite miserable, so I won't go too much into that but long story short i'm living on a kitchen floor. No space to breathe, no room to focus and no area to learn. I've got no real responsibilities, no family and no friends so relocating in terms of international levels is not a concern for me, in fact, because of Irish culture i'm more obliged to move abroad in due time.

**My situation:** I've been living in this kitchen for almost 2 years now. It is starting to get the best of me. However, I won't let it! I really want to learn, i want to do some soul searching, truly find what I want to do with my life, find purpose and of course establish a career path. In order for me to do this, I need my own SPACE! The problem is, with all this motivation for success comes great change! Change is scary. It is basically a high risk - high reward situation but I'm at the lowest of lows, so in hindsight, its quite a positive thing since i've got nothing to lose.

**What I want to do:** I don't know how realistic it is for a 21 year old guy to move far away, find a place, find a job, start learning some skills and develop themselves along the way. I don't know if its possible, however, i'm down to give it a go! The plan I have in my head right now, is to work in my store building up some more cash for the next 3 months or so, at least until this vaccine rolls out! From there i'd like to find a studio apartment somewhere in Europe, find a job to pay the bills and start learning some essential skills like IT, Business and working on some digital art, like i've always wanted to do!

**My fears:** I'm quite a spontaneous person, bravery is on my side, it has to be when you've got nobody around you. However, it's unsettling to think about. You know, what if this goes wrong? what if that goes wrong? how much money do I need to go? what if I run out of money? what if I cant choose a career? all of these questions start to fill your head! Obviously, that brings quite a lot of anxiety, stress and whatever else it may be. Now, dealing with those emotions isn't my problem, heck i've been doing that for years but being able to overcome them and really make it work is the issue.

**What should I do?** At this point you know my situation, you know my background, you know what kind of experience I have and what I want to do moving forward! I need your word, need clarification! If you were in my position, what would YOU do? If you're with me, what kind of countries would you start looking at? what are some things you'd definitely need to have before going? should I get educated first?  how do I even handle contracts? am I crazy? you know, things like that haha!

Few things to note, I don't want this post to be strictly about me, in fact, i'd love people to come here, share their thoughts, their experiences and if you're in the same position as me hopefully you can take something from this too! I want to connect with people, find how others are dealing with same decision and for those who have succeeded id love to pick your brain a little!

Thanks for reading! I appreciate all the help you can give me!

Peace and love &lt;3"
6437,I clogged the toilet bad and I don't know what to do,"Hi everyone, 

So basically I was on anti depressants that were making me really sick, so tired I could barely think or function and worst of all I had absolutely crazy constipation. 

I did several huge bloody constipation poops even after I stopped taking the anti depressant and in this particular toilet I was so tired I didn't even notice there was no toilet paper. Having already pooped and needing a way out I used the paper towel that was nearby from cleaning the bathroom. Obviously, I'm an idiot and that was a huge fucking mistake because I didn't want my first live-in bf to know what happened I flushed it down the toilet rather than try to run out to a bin or something to get rid of the poopy paper towel. 

Ugh, so now I've got this poopy toilet water that's overfilling. Whenever I flush it overfills, then a few hours later it slowly drains out but leaves lots of yucky bits behind. It's really not flushing properly. The clog is not at a point where I can get to it and just save the day either. I can't drive and have no family here that can non embarrassingly take me to a store to get a plunger etc IF that would even help..

I'm feeling really stupid and upset. I don't know how to fix this. Even to get the water etc nice and clear for a plumber guy to sort it out. I don't want to call him in and there's turd bits and lots of stinky brown water. 

I'm so mortified I don't know what to do!!"
6440,How to format cover letter,"So I'm a college senior and I'm starting to apply to jobs, and I'm a bit confused about cover letters.  If I'm submitting an application online and don't know the hiring manager who do I address the letter to? Does the cover letter still need the company's address if it's being sent online?"
6455,"Finally becoming a ""real"" 100% independent adult is so complicated and confusing. Also, most fair ways to split expenses with SO?","So I am finishing my Master's degree this month and moving to a new state with my BF. I got a job there already and its where I've always wanted to live. My BF has a really good remote job so he can work anywhere.

I have one last research paper to write and then i will be DONE with my education (at least for now), but thinking of everything that will go into finally being 100% independent and being a ""real"" adult is so daunting and it is distracting me from my work. 

**First: what is the most fair way to split expenses with my BF?** We don't know what our monthly expenses will be since there is so much going on and so much up in the air right now. So we are trying to think of how to split them. With our combined income (once I start my job and BEFORE taxes), my BF and I will make about $115,000 a year. He will make approx. 62% of that so I thought we could split expenses 60/40. My parents said that's a bad idea because what if he loses his job, will I be paying 100% because I have income and he doesnt? So would it just be better to split 50/50? Or could we sign a document where we agree that we contribute to expenses based on income % and that will continue even if someone loses their job then will change depending on income when they get a new job??? Like how should we do this???

Below are just some of the numerous questions I have and am freaking out about. They don't explain any of this to us as kids and teenagers. As much as I ask my parents about things there is only so much I understand.

My BF and I will need to get a car. How does car insurance work??? What is a car title??? How do we find the best deal on a used car?? Is it complicated to buy a used car??

My new job gave me some options for health insurance I can choose from. I had my parents look at it and they were just as confused as I am. Why would I pick a more expensive plan if it looks like it has the exact same coverage (and more expensive copays???) than the cheaper plan?? 

Retirement?? What if I only stay at this job for like 4 years? Will any retirement account assistance they gave me go away because I dont stay at that company forever???

I can't find anywhere that gives me a 100% rundown of all the taxes that I may encounter in the place I am moving to. I've found an estimator for income taxes but thats about it. How do I predict taxes so I can budget ahead of time more effectively?

Basically I have tons of questions like this and more because everything is hitting me so fast and it is all so complicated. I have no idea what my life will be like by the end of January being a real 100% independent adult and its stressing me out because there is no single guide out there and some information is really confusing (legal terminology) or complicated."
6480,Who do I call ?,"I was on my way to a babysitting gig &amp; as I was walking there; I saw either a fallen cable line, or skinny power line. It's a windy day today in LA. It was swinging, &amp; I had to count a few seconds before running past it. I want to be able to report it, because I don't want to be the reason someone may get hurt. I just don't know where to message/ and or email. Does anyone know?"
6508,Tips for getting a car by yourself?,"For background I never really had a supportive family. I wasn't allowed to have a job while I was at home and I wasn't allowed to be an adult while it was all I ever really wished for. After I left home to go to college, I got a full ride scholarship to college but to build my credit I got a credit card and now have a pretty high score with okay borrowing power. 

Fast forward I'm 21. I've been a full time student with a couple of internships and a job as a VR service attendant for the past three years which gives me a lot of experience in my field. Covid has seen me currently unemployed but I know I'll bounce back! I graduate in December 2020 so it's time to get the rest of my shit together so when I search for fulltimes there isn't anything in my way. 

Where I live, NC, USA, you have to have insurance to be able to get your driver's license. Seeing as my family was unable to put me on their insurance to even get a license I'm kind of stranded to even get a car. I don't know where to start and while I ask them for tips (not financial help), they just tell me not to worry about it and that I don't need to car right now. Well how am I supposed to get to work if I don't have reliable transportation? 

I need help. I need to know what I should be looking for in a used car (I think I may go to CarMax because it's been recommended by my friends and bosses but any other places are good too), what I need to do for insurance, and then I can get my license. I use Kelly blue book to get prices of cars and so far I'm thinking early 2000s Chevy Impala or Volkswagen Jetta as they are pretty reliable and fairly priced. I'm more leaning towards an Impala as it's parts are cheaper. I'm also leaning toward asking my credit union for a loan instead of the dealer as I've heard if you have your financial situation already fleshed out it could get you a better deal and end up being less interest. 

Any other info and tips is very much appreciated and if I'm thinking to naively feel free to correct something as everything I've gathered is my own research and experiences from my college friends."
6511,"I'm 26, and I am not an adult.","So, my situation is that I graduated from college last December. It took me 7 years to graduate and my parents supported me the whole time. I moved back in with them right after graduation and I live in their house now. 

My problem is that I don't know how to be financially independent. I don't pay my parents rent or help with the bills. They paid for my car. They pay my credit card bill. I live like a parasite.

I do have some adulting skills. I know how to find apartments, I can cook and clean, I do my own taxes every year. I lost my job due to covid but I have held down jobs long term. What I don't know how to do is be financially independent. It especially feels hopeless considering the state of the world. How am I supposed to support myself using my own two feet?"
6551,First Car Advice,"So as of right now I'm 18, and trying save up for a car. The only problem is?...I don't know shit about cars. So I thought, why not ask the lovely people of reddit to teach me some adult stuff that I know nothing about? 

Let me explain my situation first, as of right now I have a driver's learners permit, and cannot get my licence yet due to the dmv being closed. I drive pretty fine, at least I like to think so. I do have a vehicle that I can drive, though it's a 2001 Honda Accord. (not under my name so it's technically not mine.) 

 But...it's a piece of shit, with oil leaks, having to constantly refill the power steering liquid, a strange noice coming from the engine etc. Frankly it's unreliable, which I only use to go to and from the stores near my home.

I recently started working with my mom, and carpool with her to and from work with her since we work the same shift. Working 8 hours a day, 6 days a week (Which may turn into a mandatory 7 days) making $12.50 an hour. So I decided that this would be a good time to rack up my money. 

This coming fall I start college, and plan on working full time while going to school part time in the morning. And I am hoping to have my own car by then. (A used one of course.)

What would be a good amount to save up for a car?  What should I look for? Is the amount of owners a car has important? Which brand is the best? And what about mileage? Bless me with your wisdom!"
6556,Losing a Parent,"Hey. So... I have no idea if Reddit is the right place to go when it comes to advice, but it's the only place where I can be myself without seeming awkward. My dad passed away on March 8 this year. I... I can't seem to get over it because I feel like I'm missing something. He and I were the best of friends and... I don't know. I feel like my life is a little emptier without him. He helped filling a void with jokes and just listening to me talk. I can definitely say that I have no doubts of him as a father. So... I guess what I want to ask is... How do I get over this? I know that there is that social stigma of guys not having to show emotions, but I don't know how I feel. What can I do to get over this patch in my life?"
6562,Morning routine,"Hi all, 

I'm in my mid-twenties and it's high time I get my crap together. I mean I've been working on it, but taking baby steps. I think one thing that really would make a big difference is getting up early and actually using those morning hours. For me, realistically, VERY VERY early means 6am. And honestly thinking about getting up that early gives me so much anxiety because I'm not even sure what I would be doing with that time. I'm comfortable with 7am (most of the time this is when I set my alarm for work). On weekends I'd like to get up by 8:30, with 9am being ""sleeping in"". I've read that most successful people rise very early and I'd like to get in that habit.

My problem when I get up early is that I'm not really quite sure what to do with myself. It feels like everything I was doing yesterday was reset, and now I have to find somewhere to ""begin""--for example, I'm working on some school applications now. I try to get a little bit done in the afternoon everyday when motivation strikes, but then continuing that the next morning feels like I'm starting all over, not building on what I did yesterday. 

I also mentioned that getting up early gives me anxiety--part of this is because I don't know how to get my morning started at that early hour. I think it might have something to do with finding motivation to start. 

So my question is: does anyone have a nice calm morning routine? Something involving sitting down with a cup of coffee and jumpstarting the day? Something easy and pleasant, but also productive. Would love to hear your ideas. Thanks in advance!"
6578,How are adults supposed to dress?,"So this is something I've noticed, apparently I'm ""not an adult"" because I like to still wear my old concert and superhero t-shirts and jeans despite being nearly into my 40s. Here's the thing though. They're comfortable. I like them. I've probably worn a suit and tie a handful of times in my entirely life, and even then only for other people. I'm autistic so wearing a tie is actually physically stressful for me. How I dress SHOULDN'T be an issue, especially outside of work but apparently I'm still judged on it because we have a society of busybodies. I have no idea what ""fashionable"" or ""stylish"" means so please explain it to me like I'm a child. I don't know brand names or what celebrities wear but I at least can understand what a style of clothing is if its explained to me or I can at least Google it. Thanks."
6611,Desperately need help with adult things and don't know where to turn to.,"  Hey reddit,  Sorry if this reads awkward but I really don't have anyone else to turn to.  I (21M) need help learning how to adult, and fast.  In March I lost my job and apartment and had to move ~2,000 miles across the country to live with my parents as I had no where else to go.  My dad's alright but busy. He works up to 14 hours a day to provide for my family here back home,  but hasn't gotten a paycheck in quite a while due to work bullshit and he's having to budget quite hard.  On the other hand my Mom's a max level alcoholic who can't function at all.  As of recently she's basically decided to stop trying,   so now it's up to me to step up as the oldest kid and provide for my three siblings.  She's beyond my help,  trust me.  If I couldn't handle the emotional incest and being her keeper before all this as I was growing up,  there's absolutely fuck nothing I can do for her now.  So instead I'm just going to focus on doing what needs to be done to keep everything following some semblance of order.  

  This house is a wreck,  and quite frankly,  a health hazard. Nobody does the dishes so after anyone eats they just walk their plates from their room and leave it somewhere on a counter to rot until I walk out there and throw it away myself.  Dishes used for cooking never get cleaned and sit piled up on the counters,  with food sitting and rotting out in the open.  Food also sits rotting out in the unopen as well.  I've found old tupperware with old food in it that judging by the contents inside had to have been sitting around for at least half a year.  We have a roach infestation (probably has something to do with, you know, the rotting food all over the place and general uncleanliness) and the inside of every drawer or cabinet is filled with droppings and dead roaches.  Even our fridge and freezer has them lying dead in there.  Multiple things are broken and in desperate need of repairs.  My two youngest brothers are out of school and have been for a year and do nothing but play video games,  eat,  sleep,  and repeat.  They're also both on the spectrum and aren't getting the help or parenting that they need to succeed (I have ADHD and other mental disabilities so I know first hand how hard that can be).  I don't know how CPS hasn't been called.

  The place I think to start (other than getting the much needed cleaning out of the way) is to create a meal plan. I know that sounds like a weird place to start in a situation like this,  but cooking is what I get the most joy out of in my life.  I'm not a professional and don't know how to do much,  but food is a driving force for me.  It's a curse and a blessing.  My train of thinking is if I make a meal plan and do all the shopping, I'll be able to budget best what hits our funds the hardest (besides my Mom's aforementioned alcohol addiction) so we'll have more money.  And since I'll be the one cooking,  I'll be the one to without a doubt clean it up as I'm more inclined to clean up after my own messes than the messes of others (which is ironic considering the topic of this post). And with the cooking and cleaning out of the way and with nothing else left to be done around here,  things might return to somewhat functional.  Which is reality is my overall goal. 

  I know this is more than I can handle but I still want to try my best while I'm back here.  So I realize this post has mostly been a vent but I feel like knowing a bit about the severity of my situation might help tailor some answers to it.  So here's the TLDR of what I'd really like to know:

* What are some resources and / or recipes using cheap ingredients that can provide meals for a household of 6 that can be made in bulk to make cooking and planning meals easier? 
* What would be the best way to deal with any remaining roaches after all the old food and grime has been cleaned up?
* How can I keep myself sane and motivated throughout all of this?  I'm personally not doing to well mentally and there's been some close calls while I've been home. Despite that I still want to keep trying and moving forward until I can get back out of here and out on my own, but I'm just at my wits end.

  Sorry if this post is an unorganized mess, my brain's all over the place. The world is dying and on fire,  I've lost my job and my apartment and with that my community that kept me structured and not a mess.  Thank you for any replies,  I'll be sure to check back on this thread when I can."
6655,How should I deal with my 16 year old sister?," So, background info that will help:

My dad has an issue with being alone so he’s constantly meeting new girls and getting new girlfriends one after the other. He met his recent girlfriend at the beach last summer and has fallen madly in love with her for some reason. They constantly spend time together and most of the time he’s never home anymore because he bought a house with her (so me and my sister basically live alone). My dad is so in love or obsessed (or whatever he is) with this woman that he won't miss a single one of her workout classes that she teaches every Tuesday night. If there is something important going on like a doctors appointment or something at school for my sister (she’s in the band), he will cancel and reschedule or just miss it so he doesn’t miss her class. That’s how bad it is. 

Now onto the issue with my sister. 

So the first incident happened when my sister got into a relationship with someone 2 years younger than her. My dad  was never home  so she took it upon herself to sneak this girl into our house. (i’ve never met this girl before). I was extremely upset because I was for 1 never awake when she snuck this girl in and 2 she could have easily invited people into our home and they could have stole something or broke something. Anyway, she kept sneaking this little girl in and I had no choice but to tell dad. So of course he gets mad but he doesn’t really do anything. He doesn’t take her phone or ground her or do anything, but he gets a camera to keep downstairs, and continues spending all of his time with his girlfriend. 

(also, my dad's girlfriend is an alcoholic and my dad kinda is too. They were always having parties on the weekend and lots of drinking was involved and my sister was allowed to drink too ((not that big of a deal when it's in your own household)) and it got to the point where she was WANTING to do it every weekend and would get so drunk she couldn’t even walk or speak correctly. I brought it up to dad and all he did was get pissed at me because he thought i was telling him he's a bad father) My dad “attempted” to tell her she couldn't drink anymore but it continued to happen, and then it got to the point where she was sneaking our dads alcohol when he wasn't home, so I had to tattle on her about that too. Again, my dad must've not taken it that serious because he kept staying nights at a time with his girlfriend. I started trying to put my foot down with my sister since my dad couldn’t and then she started pulling the “i’ll  just kill myself” card on me. So I told my dad about that and then he got mad at me! He threatens to put me in jail and then tells me I need to stop worrying about her and trying to tell her what to do, so then he FORCES  me and my sister to drive 2 hours to him and his girlfriend's new house. 

Long story short… my dad  doesn’t give a shit about my sister and the trouble she’s getting herself into because he’s pussywhiped. My sister is involved with a little girl who changed her completely. She’s addicted to juuls and alcohol, and every-time i try to set her straight everything comes falling back on me. Dad gets mad because he thinks I'm just trying to keep him from seeing his girlfriend, he won't take responsibility and just threatens me and my sister, and I'm only 18!! I've never had kids before and I don't know what to do. I work a full time job and I don't need my sister at home by herself sneaking people in or trying to kill herself because she thinks she’s just a burden or something. I just need some advice on what i should do."
6657,I can't anymore,"I find it so damn hard to talk to people , texting and calling is physically painful. I tend to attach to people really easily and then I give them maximum effort for everything they ask me to do and then later on I realize I have been sharing my whole life with them but they have been hiding almost everything from me. I can't even say hi to anyone , let alone hold a conversation coz I am scared they might get tired of me just like so many others have. I don't know how to hold myself , it's either you get all of me or none of me. I don't know how to limit my effort. 
I am dying to make connections but at the same time scared to death of losing them because of who I am."
6678,Classmate is giving me a recliner and I'm concerned about bed bugs,"My classmate is giving me their old recliner. I wouldn't call them a friend and I don't know their living conditions. We partnered up for a project once and they said they needed to get rid of it.  
  
Since I don't know anything about this person's home, when I got it back to my place, I put it in my garage and closed the door. I have not brought it inside, and there's nothing in my garage for a bed bug to set up residence in. It's a recliner sitting where I car would be basically.

6696,29 years old and feeling like I'm going nowhere.,"29 years old and live in NYC with my family. I recently got the phone call last week that I've been furloughed from my job for the next four months and will be unemployed. Basically I'm completely lost and I'm unsure of what my next plan is.

I didn't care for my job (I only made slightly above minimum wage and it was a dead end office job), but I needed to experience and money with the end goal of eventually moving out of New York (I've managed to save 23K).

Now that I've lost my job, I don't know what to do next and I'm not sure if I even want to apply for another position in NYC (I have no desire to place roots here and develop a career in this city/state).

I recently got back on my antidepressant and will be seeing a therapist soon.

Any of you get over issues with living alone?

It just makes me much more depressed than is reasonable, and the pain becomes difficult to deal with..."
6720,i feel like i'll never be free,i'm 20 years old and i live with my dad who barely works. i work 7 days straight and i have 4-3 off days depending on my schedule and he works about 3 days a week. he just started working a couple weeks ago but i've been working and paying ALL the bills including his phone bill ever since i moved to his house in the summer of 2018. i feel like he's taking advantage of me and every time i say something about it he talks about how i don't know the real struggle and how he had to provide for me and my siblings when he barely had anything. (we only stayed at his house for an entire year together and me an extra year when i was younger. he barely helped our mom) i want to save up to buy a used car and then save to move away. it's kinda of hard when every week i have to pay for groceries and bills. and my dad is an able man by the way. there's nothing wrong with him! i can't move with my mom because there's no jobs or space in the house. also i feel like our relationship will go bad. i also want to do some type of trade or find an online side job that pays until i can find a career. i don't even know what i want to do in my life and i feel like i'm running out of time. i need advice on how to save my money and make sure that when i can move i have everything ready. also i'm not too educated on credit but i feel like that is very important so please tell me how to do that! thanks
6726,Is it wrong that I'm barely an adult but I already want to give up?,"I honestly have no idea where I want my life to go. I don't know what I want to do for a living, and I'm scared to detach that if I make the wrong descion I'm going to wind up screwed for the rest of my life. 
My original plan was to flip a couple of houses, rent them out, and have that as my passive income. So I won't have to work in the system my whole life, ya know? But making heads or tails of where I should start feels impossible, and even though I'm getting advice from many adults, (with all due respect to them), I feel like I can't use any of it because of this stupid pandemic. Not to mention the fact that my housing situation is going to crap in the next few months because the lease is ending, and I still live with my parent. My s/o wants me to move out with them and into a little place so we can get started, but I'm worried that with all factors included that in going to fall flat on my face and get the inevitable, ""hate to say I told you so"". I don't want to be a working drone the rest of my life y'all. What do I do?"

I live in California while they're in New Jersey so I'm limited to helping online and over phone although I plan to visit after receiving the COVID Vaccine.  

The main goals/obstacles as I'm aware are.

1. They haven't done their taxes in a few years, most likely owe some money to the government.

6765,what can I get my dad as a housewarming gift?,"hello all, I hope you’ve had a lovely New Year’s Day :)

my parents are in the process of getting divorced, so as a result, my dad and I will be moving out of our current house in February and into a nice apartment. the divorce and 2020 in general were tough on my dad emotionally, mentally, and financially, so I’d really like to do something sweet for him to get him comfortable in our new home (and hopefully excited about this new chapter in his life). unfortunately, as I'm completely clueless when it comes to adulting, I don't know exactly how housewarming parties and gifts work. I mostly want to figure out how to best show my appreciation for him.

one of my friends was generous enough to gift me an air fryer as a collective Christmas/graduation/birthday gift, which made me really grateful because that’s one of the things that I knew for sure my dad has been wanting. he’s always wanted to be able to cook healthy and tasty meals, and air fryers seem to be super convenient as well. I’ve already told him that I have the air fryer and that I’m going to give it to him to keep (as much as I'd love to have one for college, we’re currently in the US, so I can’t take it with me to Europe sadly), but only after we move (my mom also said she wants one too, so I’d rather not open it now lest my mom claim it for herself...).

I’ve been thinking of some other things I could get for us (mainly for him) in the new apartment.

some things to note:

* the new apartment will be two bedrooms and about 1,200 square feet (\~112 square meters)
* I don’t really think it’d be a good idea to buy something that we might end up buying anyway when we get around to furniture shopping (like basic kitchen utensils or whatever). I mean, I guess it’d save on costs, but I figure it’s nicer if I get him something he wouldn’t think to get himself but that would still be super nice to have
* I will be leaving for college in Europe in August or so, so I don’t expect to come back to visit often, which means that after that, my dad will be by himself most of the time (with the exception of my little sister coming to occasionally visit or potentially even living with him if he gets custody)
* as a recent high school graduate with minimal savings, my budget is $100, although I’d be willing to go up to $200 for something really, really awesome for my dad
* don’t know if this is something to note per se, but just wanted to share that my dad is a pretty simple man. I never really know what to gift him because he’s like the person who already has everything (that he wants and needs). because of that, I usually just get him gift cards for restaurants we go to together or movie tickets. essentially experiences rather than material gifts, hence my trouble getting him a housewarming gift

I did some quick searches online, and after taking some inspiration from that, I’ve come up with a couple of ideas for a gift:

* a wine rack. the only thing is, my dad doesn’t drink all that often, but when he does, it’s usually because I want to (to celebrate or just for culinary purposes) or it’s beer (alcohol-free Heineken to be specific)
* a pressure cooker. we have a Crockpot already though (which I think is considered a slow cooker?) so I don’t know if this would be any different
* a Roomba or something of the sort. we have one in our current house, but obviously we won’t be taking it with us. could be convenient since he’ll eventually be living pretty much alone, but I don’t know if a mere apartment warrants a whole robot
* artwork. I remember my dad mentioning how he always wanted to ""get into interior design"" and have a space of his own to make look all pretty, but I don't want to buy something that he might not like or that doesn't go with the rest of the room
* a bike? I don’t know if this is appropriate as a housewarming gift, but since our new apartment is literally ten minutes away from his work, he was considering using my bike to get there, but I’m worried it might be too small or that he’d just prefer to have his own

please feel free to leave any comments or suggestions on nice things I could get him! I'm happy to answer any questions or make clarifications as well. he’s so strong and such a hard worker, so to see him struggle this past year has made me all the more motivated to do something nice for him and let him know that he's appreciated and that things are going to be okay.

side note: I’ve decided against throwing a full-on housewarming party because you know, the pandemic. I considered maybe inviting one or two of his good friends over for a simple dinner, but I’m not really quite sure if that’s a great idea or what to expect (do we give them an apartment tour? do they bring gifts? what do people even do at housewarming parties?). I figured that a gift from me (and my friend who gifted the air fryer) and maybe FaceTiming some family and friends would suffice. if you have any suggestions for how I could organize something nice as well, please let me know!

thank you in advance for all your help :)"
6770,Time to grow up. Now how does that work?,"Ok. So I'm about to apply for colleges so I'll be living on my own. I want to learn to become more independent. I'm just realizing how much I don't know about being an adult. I don't know much about legal documents and stuff, budgeting, immigration procedures, banking stuff, etc. How do I start?"
6776,Have you ever left your home state just for the thrill of it?,"Hey all. 

I'm a 24 year old female and back in September I moved out of my parent's house after 23 years of living in the same childhood home my entire life. I currently share a two bedroom apartment with my roommate about 20 minutes from where I grew up. needless to say, I'm basically living the same life I grew up in, just on my own. 

I've been dreaming of moving out of Illinois, where I'm from, for as long as I could remember. my only failed attempt was going to college for two semesters in Wisconsin before realizing I hated Wisconsin even more. anyways, my point is that when my lease is up in august I'm highly considering moving somewhere new. I'd love to go west. maybe Salt Lake City or bend, Oregon. Technically, California is first on my list but I'd never make that happen on 30k a year.

The problem is that I have no *real reason* to run so far from home. I don't have a job to follow, I don't have a person to follow. There's nothing chasing me out of town. In fact, I think I'm just too comfortable where I am now. I love having my family close, I live with my best friend, and I work as a preschool teacher in typical 9-5 fashion. **Have you ever moved states simply for the thrill of it?** I don't know why I feel like I need the justification. maybe I just need someone to tell me it's possible and worth it. why do I feel like I have to stay where my parents chose to build their lives? Of course, I understand that in order to make it happen I need to save money and find a job and a place to live. I get the logistics of it all. I just can't push myself to make such a crazy change for the hell of it."
6797,How much should I care about my reputation?,"Don't get me wrong. I know I should be a good person and not be a dick to others. But sometimes it looks like it doesn't matter what I do people will say untrue things about me and it bothers me.
I don't know if I should try to show them that I'm not the person they think I am or leave it. They will keep saying it anyway."
6812,Need career advice,"Hey guys, 

I am 22. I recently graduated (online, fml). I have a job offered but I don't know whether they are gonna keep me or not once this pandemic subsides. Everyone is cutting costs. So, I wouldn't blame them. 

But I have no idea what to do with my life. I just wanted to get independent first and then follow my dreams and shit. All of that has come to a standstill now. 

I have no clue what to do. I could really do with some advice. 

If anyone is free and can take out some precious time out of their day, I would love to go into details. 
You can DM me or message me.

Thank you."
6816,"I understand how to SHOP for a car, but how to BUY is another story. Please help!","Hi! So I (28 years old) have managed to make it this far without having to buy a car from a dealership. Honestly, I am terrified of doing something wrong in the process of buying and would love some help from people who know how it works. Shopping for a car is easy, finding a good deal is easy, even negotiating is easy. What I don't know is what to expect when I'm actually going through the TRANSACTION. Should I finance through the dealer? Through a bank? Should I already have insurance quotes (can I even get those without the car)? Is there an interim period where I am covered through the dealership while I look for a good quote? Should I just get whatever insurance I can get by phone before leaving the lot and THEN comparison shop for good rates after the fact and stick it out with the short term insurance I get in the meantime?? I figure that registration will be done with the purchase process, but am I wrong on that? I am also planning to buy a used car, but am confused about how much ""certified"" really means on a used vehicle. Should I always take a vehicle I'm considering buying to be inspected by a mechanic? How would I arrange that if I were looking to buy at a dealership and not with a private owner?

I've tried so hard to find the answers to these questions both online and by asking friends, but all anyone ever talks about in car-buying how-tos is the shopping process, not the BUYING.

Help me Reddit. You're my only hope!"

6935,Moving out advice,"Hi, I'm tired of the rocky relationship I have with my mom and I'm turning 17 in November. I'm a senior in highschool and live in a poor neighborhood in California (and even housing in my city is extremely expensive, currently live in a 1 bedroom which is 1000+. We live in subsided housing.)

I don't have work experience, I'm a good student (4.0+ GPA), I don't have connections (mostly because of her) to my older brother who's moved out, my dad, or any other family I could possibly stay with. I have 1 friend who I could possibly move in with, but I don't want that to be my first option in getting out.

I'm unknowledgable about a lot of things, such as how to manage finances (though I know you should save more than you spend), landlords and stuff of that sort, cooking, etc. 

I hope to be able to get out of here by college, if not earlier. I've been thinking about going to college in the Netherlands (father's second home country aside from the country he was born in) or a different European country due to financial reasons. My mother forbids me from leaving the state, so I don't know how to get out of this situation and start adulting.

What should I start doing first to get to the point where I can move out, especially in Corona time?"
6953,should I take this job,"okay so I've been jobless since March, thanks corona virus, and I don't know when or if I'll ever get that job back. today I just learned about a couple new job openings at the local post office for mail delivery, it sounds like an absolute dream job that I would love to do. there are drawbacks. first, you've gotta supply your own vehicle. no problem, BUT, you have to have the car modified so you can drive on the right hand side... and there's no way I'm modifying my car like that. from my understanding it's common to buy a cheap car and have it modified but that stresses me out a lot because I'd be spending a lot of money for a cheap car to be modified for a part time job that I have no experience in and I don't even know if I'd wanna stay at, or could even do. like I'm just thinking about how many paychecks it would take until I made that back. second drawback, coronavirus. I don't know anything about applying for or training for this job but I have a friend who works/worked (?) there and can ask her to know for sure, but I would ASSUME you'd come into contact with people. surely you have to be inside of a car with someone while training? inside the tiny post office with other people? touching hundreds of pieces of mail other people touched? straight up I can't risk that. I live with my high risk mom, I can't take a chance on getting her sick or dying and I don't want to take a chance on my own health and life either. 

and I understand devil's advocate, that I'm only looking at all the negatives, gotta spend money to make money, you have to take risks on things, you can't be afraid of little obstacles and hold yourself back from something great. you risk your life every time you go to the grocery store. I get that. this is a great opportunity. any other time I probably would leap at this job despite the car issue. I'm definitely going to do more research on my own and maybe call my friend to ask her about the job but I wanted the opinion of strangers too because varied perspectives are good. I don't know what to do, my life definitely does not depend on this, like I said I live with my mom, thank god. I really want some more perspectives and opinions on this, what you guys would do, etc"

6991,6 months,"At that time I was 13 and 38 ...

Yesterday was my birthday but I could not escape because they made me miss the same, I also wanted to miss you sent me a message and I will write copying what you told me: 

I love you my love you make me happy, all those smiles that I get you fill me, I adore you dear thanks for being with me and not making me feel alone even though sometimes you are sad and I don't know what to do I try to fill you in some way, I love you too much love I hope you feel the same and tomorrow come and be with me I wait for you.

So today it was about leaving because I already left, I was with you and I will tell you about it, I got to your house.

Likewise, even though you don't like it, I came home and I saw you waiting for me, you took me to eat.

It was delicious but while we were eating you couldn't stop looking at me and I was turning red. You saw me in an intense way. Of course I wanted to kiss you but there was no way.

In addition, later we went to the riverbank of the mother's park, where I could hug you there. We were bothering each other even though I wanted to kiss you, I couldn't get to the house. 

You sang to me on your birthday, you have a beautiful one, I couldn't record you and I regret that, my phone had been damaged and only you singing with your guitar will remain in my memory and from there you finished singing to me.

You saw me in an adorable way and since we were at your house, you took me and kissed me in a beautiful way. Of course I continued kissing you and suddenly. 

You put down your guitar and from there you took me, you made me love you and you took me to bed. You put me there and I kept looking at you because I didn't know what you had in mind.

You kept kissing me, at the same time you took off my shirt and caressed my bare skin. 

When you suddenly stopped and said sorry but I can't. 

Back then I had no idea, but now I laugh at the innocence that I possessed.

What thing you wanted, I asked myself over and over again.

You apologized, you said excuse me I thought if I could, excuse me if I hurt you and lowered your head in a form of regret. 

After a few hours, you left me at my house.

But there was something peculiar in your eyes. Something I've honestly never seen, a precise warmth to the target. That it was me. 

You left me and you kissed me, you said goodbye and you told me I love you. I saw you and you blushed. 

I told you I love you and you looked at me, you moved your head to one side and the other. You laughed and winked at me. 

You left, I entered my house and I thought well. Later I realized what you wanted to do, but then I did not assume anything. 

After a while I felt a nice chill, and the memory that you were on top of me kissing me of that intensity. It's the only thing that persists until now.

I adore you Jay."

7075,"Moving, changing jobs, and crisis","I'm sorry this is long. I'm asking for advice relative to the experience I've had so far.

My boyfriend and I need to move out of his parents' house. Living here is immensely stressful especially due to his mother's mental illness. We desperately need advice or affirmation or something because we are lost. We've been trying to figure this out since March and different problems have come up.

**Apartments Here**

We both currently attend college full-time (year round, online) and work part-time in dead-end retail jobs. Right now, we make enough for a very cheap rental apartment (studio &lt;$750) due to our state's high minimum wage. There are a couple of these in our city. We avoid about half of them due to dangerous neighborhoods. Most places around us are $1000 at minimum (this is more of a ""second home"" tourist town). I have an email inquiry out right now about touring a place for $600 in the next city over. The last potential tour call I got was right before the quarantine and I had to pull out of that.

Our city is very depressed. It is one of the poorest in the state. There are only a handful of stores here. The population feels mostly 60+ years old (we are in our 30s). We have to drive an hour and a half in either direction to go to a mall or reach anything remotely relevant to our interests. Additionally, although perhaps less importantly, I want to have a dog, but no where around us under $1500 allows pets. All of this makes moving within our current area a hard pill to swallow.

**Trying to Move Out-of-State**

We *want* to leave the city and move out of state. We spent our entire quarantine researching states and cities, picking one specific place, and applying to full-time jobs in that city. The minimum wage there is federal minimum, but there are many more apartments for around $600. No place was hiring or interested in us. We were applying to essential businesses like groceries as well as non-essentials. I imagine part of this was due to quarantine business loss/hour cuts and part due to the fact our resumes listed an out-of-state address.

Then, I started having sudden health problems. It has gotten to the point where I am wearing a heart monitor for a month with various follow-up appointments at 6-8 weeks, and I have made neurological and other misc. appointments to try to find out what is wrong with me. These appointments have us pinned us down to our current area for the next 2-3 months.

We thought a long time about whether it would be better to stay with his parents for a couple more months (or longer, depending on if I get a diagnosis) or if we need to move urgently. We decided to give up on moving out of state look for places in our area again, within the parameters of our current part time wages. So, basically, go back to the top of the post. This is why we are so lost and don't know what to do. We're very conflicted and it feels like there is no good answer.

**Back Here Again**

We've been told to look into city housing or something like that. We've considered it a few times but have never truly attempted it. I'm worried about 2+ year wait lists.

We've also briefly considered outright buying a home, but it's not something we want to do until we have stable careers. I've entertained the idea of a tiny house or a van/bus house, but I don't think we want to go down that route for reasons such as internet access and having our own space (we've lived together in a bedroom for over a year now).

A few weeks ago, we were stoked to hear from a friend that a place in his building (4 units) will be available by the end of July. However, we found out that the building has a problem tenant that is destructive, so the landlord is waiting on the courts to reopen so he can evict that tenant before anyone else moves in. Considering eviction can take a month in itself and there's no ETA on courts reopening, we have no idea when this apartment will be open.

It's another gut punch. It feels like nothing is working, and meanwhile the situation in the house is as terrible as ever. We're in such a state of confusion and desperation that my boyfriend is looking again for places out-of-state (new places as well as the original city we wanted to move to), even though we can't go for another 2-3 months. Staying here another few months is a staggering and incredibly depressing concept, especially with no real end in sight.

We want to get full-time jobs so we have more options, but this is nigh impossible until we graduate, and even then I don't know if it's possible in this city. I'll be done next year, but I need to build my career/experience in the meantime in spite of the fact my current job leaves my completely exhausted by the time I get home. My boyfriend won't be done for another three years. To cap it all off, he really wants to change jobs immediately. His main job is awful and he struggles with his second one; but he has no idea where to apply because we don't know where to live. We haven't been able to nail one piece of this puzzle down to attach all the other pieces.

**TLDR**

Boyfriend and I live with his mentally ill mother, in an economically depressed area that has no future. We want to move out of state but can't for 2-3 months due to health concerns. We're trying to find a place in our area that we can afford with dead-end retail jobs, but nothing is working out.

**Wrap Up**

As I re-read this post, it seems to me the conclusion is that we have to apply to full-time jobs in our area (if we can find any) and in the meantime keep trying to get an apartment here since we want to get out as soon as possible. Basically, we must keep on doing what we're doing. That's all I know to do. We are just so worn down by it not working that it seems like we are doing this wrong.

7119,Fruit Flies -- Please Help!!!!,"Hi, I was just wondering if you could tell if there's anyway to get fruit flies. I assure you I'm a very clean person.

Well, I came the next day and she had never touched the food, and the bowl was swarming with fruit flies. I don't know where they're coming from! 
Anyway, not my garbage can is disgusting and constantly swarming with the things. I don't know what to do. I tried rinsing it out with vinegar, but they just came back after the smell wore off.

I'm 28, female. From South Asia, but I live in Europe now. I've been here 6 years, the beginning was good as I came for my studies but as adult life started in a new city, things got difficult. I don't have many people I connect with, but Berlin is also a place where people come and eventually go.

I have an ex from university who I recently found out had reached a milestone with his current partner, and I think part of why I'm feeling sour is because of that. An old roommate from uni just got engaged. Another friend from university bought a house with his girlfriend. I know that we shouldn't compare and things happening their own time, but it really feels like everyone has found their home but I'm still struggling. I live in a house with 4 other roommates and they're quite nice, and we all have a great dynamic. But I know that if they don't feel great here, they all have a place with real friends to go back to. And I have one really good friend in this city, someone I met during the pandemic, but she too is European and I know she might go back to her hometown eventually. I guess I feel bad that I don't really have a place to go to. My relationship with my parents is difficult to say the least, as is the same with my sister. And in all honesty, I want to live in a first world country. I've worked hard to converse in German properly, which I now can, and I'm a proud resident of the European Union. But it doesn't change the fact that I lack true connection to the city I'm in now.

I've tried to be positive, and on most days I am. About a year ago, I decided I would give Berlin another year, and then leave if things don't get better. Of course, with the pandemic it was difficult to try to create a better life for myself. I'd like to date and be in love, have a real family feeling, but I'm scared to get attached to anybody here (friend or otherwise) because everyone might leave eventually. And I feel I'll be too old soon to try and begin elsewhere. But I don't know where to go and there's just so much pressure to make a decision and just move. Where should I go? It could influence my entire life! What if it's the wrong decision? What if I make a decision, and I go elsewhere, and nothing  happens? It's  a lot of pressure and I'm even crying as I type this.

I feel like I'm doing a lot by myself. And I feel like anyone I meet wouldn't want the pressure of being my friend or my boyfriend because I wouldn't have anybody else. I know it's always a step at time, but it's really coming down on me all at once and I don't know how to deal with the pressure. There are times when it's just too hard.

I guess part of my wants to hear how other people felt the same and eventually found their peace and happiness. Success stories might give me some hope and let me know things won't be so bad."

I need to make money, and I need to be able to save it in a safe place. I have a few ideas, such as selling my art, opening a Redbubble account, selling my old stuff online. But I don't know how to do that without my own personal bank account.

7345,Dealing with noisy neighbours,"I live in an old apartment building with approximately 14 other units in it. The walls are somewhat thick, yet I hear the assholes across the hall near-constantly. Music, TV, yelling, partying, all sorts of things. Hardly ever hear a peep from the ladies I share a wall with, nothing from the gentlemen downstairs, and very little from the folks up above me. So I think it is them genuinely being inconsiderate, rather than just the sounds of people going about their daily lives. I've knocked on their door before, but they haven't answered. I left a note on their door asking them to be more considerate (after they were still blasting music at 2 am on a weeknight) and they don't appear to have any intention of changing.  Our lease states that ""Tenant and tenant's guests shall not disturb the peace and quiet of other tenants and neighbours"" and that violating rules can get you fined $50 but I don't know what counts as disturbing the peace (and also I don't really wanna get fines involved).

7458,Socially Inexperienced 20-Something with a Lot of Questions,"Hello reddit,


I'm a barely 20 year old who has no idea what the fuck he's doing. Long story short, halfway through my childhood it everything got twist turned upside down and I've barely left my house since, have no local friends, and parents are a bust. On top of that I've got both physical and mental disorders that I've lived with my whole life, which don't help. But I don't want to live in a puddle of self pity and blame anymore, so I'm trying to figure shit out. Thing is though, who would have thought that opting out of society and not talking to nearly anybody for 8 years would make it very hard to opt back in to society. Wild concept, I know. I just don't know where to start, which is why I'm coming here hoping to know where to start.


While I live with my parents, they're the sort of people you'd see talked about on /r/raisedbynarcissists or /r/justnofamily . So going to them for help is like going to a combo anvil-and-rope shop for pool floaties. My main goal is to get out of here as soon as I can, which I'm working on by trying to find a job. It's not going too well, but I have hope.


I can't think of the best way to ask all of my questions, so I'll just list what I can think of. Any replies will be read and appreciated.


List of things I need help figuring out:
- How to not be a social failure. I'm probably autistic (and I mean this legitimately, my family has a long history of it but I can't see a doctor to talk to anyone about it as of right now), and have major social anxiety. Turns out that not talking to anyone for years can undo any social skills that I'd managed to develop! When I do manage to go out and about, my social skills can be summed up of replying with vague ""mhm"" ""yeah"" ""uh huh"" and nods and bows I can barely convey without panicking. Despite this, I often somehow manage to say something that a few hours after I've said it I replay the conversation in my head and realize I've said something that in the situation was rude and lose sleep over it.
- How to land a job. I have no valuable skills and dropped out of school, and eventually persuaded to not return. It's too late for me to go back to high school now, and I can't afford to get my GED right now (no money to travel / means of travel + test prices). This means no one wants to hire me, because they assume I'm illiterate and can't do a good job. I've applied at so many places; at fast food joints, supermarkets, general stores, etc. They either instantly send a rejection letter when they've been hiring for months / always short staffed (looking at you target) or don't either bother sending a rejection letter at all. I don't care what I do at this point, I just need to land something. Anything. 
- How taxes and bills and money management works. I know **how** to save money (via literally just not spending it), but I know nothing about how to budget, how taxes would work, basically anything related to money.
- Questions to ask when touring / applying to an apartment so that you don't get a horrible deal and to get a better chance of getting your application accepted. There's an apartment complex I've been looking at that after I'd have a job would easily be able to afford. It's nothing super fancy, but it's the best bang for your buck in my area. I wouldn't want to fuck up my chances when the time for me to go apartment hunting arises.


And general adulting stuff that I might have missed or not thought of. I'm terrified of having to live with my parents even another year, and I think that if I don't get out of here and end up living with them my whole life I'd genuinely rather die. Sorry if this is a lot or a bummer of a post, I'm just scared and want my situation to change for the better. If this post would fit better on a different subreddit or doesn't fit here, please let me know and I'll modify / change it. Thank you for your time.

7461,"I'm going to uni in half a year and I don't know how to survive without my parents doing everything for me, help!!","So uh sorry if this sounds stuck up but I'm moving out for uni in half a year and I don't know how to do anything. I don't know how to cook, do laundry, don't know how often things should be washed, don't know which medical appointments I should have every few months. Everything at home was always done for me and whenever I wanted money my parents would give it to me, so I don't know how to budget or save money either. I don't know how to get a job or simcard for another country, or any hidden costs that I'll need to pay in university. I'm so clueless, how am I going to afford going out and buying myself things when I'm in uni if I have so much to pay for like utilities and other stuff? Is it just all downhill from here?

7475,How to deal with this very bad service?,"So I wanted a custom dress made. I went to a dressmaker and she asked when I want it ready. I told her I'm in no rush and she said it'll be finished in two weeks.

So I wait and wait and wait and she never calls me. I went to her on the 18th of November, and it's now nearly 2020. I paid no deposit but had given her the material to make the dress.

7498,Question About Eharmony Payment Plans - I can't Adult Right,"I feel like I don't know things right. Maybe it's a internet thing.  I just can't use my adult brain right now from tired.   


So I'm here and lonely on Christmas. Been on tinder, bumble, and OK Cupid. Not really finding much as in no one finds me. Thinking eharmony has a good track record apparently and I'm sure that with the required payments, it filters out some of the people you would find on the other sites mentioned. So here I am going to put in my credit card info and I see [this](https://imgur.com/a/X3d8sIO) and I have to choose one. I thought about joining the site because it originally said $7 for the first three months and then it changes to $14 a month for 24 months. I could do that. I can't do the thing shown there. What's the reasoning behind it and should I be worried? Am I going to be charged a insane amount right off the back?"
7501,I don't know how to adult,"Thank you for letting me rant:

I (25F) graduated college two years ago and it's been a downhill spiral since.

Granted, I am a lot more fortunate than others, and I try to stay thankful but I can't help but feel like a failure. 

Am I asking for too much to make 40k a year? That's literally all I want. 

I just want to be able to support myself in a small tiny tiny home/apartment/anything and be comfortable. I can't seem to find a job that pays over $15/hr (I live in TX to give perspective). I'm on a very strict budget, and all my money is going towards debt and savings (the only thing I have going for me at the moment, is that I have a great credit score). I had to move back home right before I graduated college (I lived in an apartment in the same city) and I'm currently still at home with my parents. It's also tough because my siblings and my friends have all managed to get good paying CAREERS and I'm so happy for them but sometimes you can't help but compare. I try to stay in my lane and focus on myself but I don't even have money to get me a week of groceries (in a lot of debt). I wish I could go back in time and not waste time in a stupid major (biology) because I can't seem to figure out how to make this work for me. I work for a small company now and there's not much room to grow. I look for jobs every week but lately I haven't been able to pass their initial automated checkpoint. Right now the only thing going for me is that I have a great credit score, but I am a good employee, I'm a ball of energy, I take initiate, and I know I can do any task that is given to me.

I am a good employee, I'm a ball of energy, I take initiate, and I know I can do any task that is given to me. 

I just wish I knew my life's calling, because I feel like failure trying to figure it out.

7525,Jobs seem pretty useful.,"I'm 16, it's nearing the end of summer, I'm about to start my first year of college and I don't have a job. I've applied to a fair few places and went on person to ask for one at the local art store the I like but it's not working out. I don't know how to make my cv look good, I can't drive and basically every job being advertised to me wants me to be able to drive, and I haven't got my GCSE results yet either so that's a pretty big part missing. How do i do it? I have nothing desirable and I can't get any desirable skills until I have a job, this is a circle of torture. I just want some money, I would do baby sitting and stuff to get some small cash but I hate kids with a passion so that just doesn't feel advisable."
7531,"How to get over being embarrassed about not knowing ""how to adult""?","Like others here, I grew up in a household that didn't prioritize teaching life skills. It was generally abusive because of my mom, but she didn't leave (/wasn't gone) until my freshman year of college. I'm friends with a lot of people younger than me, and they all have licenses, jobs, a clue of how to just do things and live in general. I don't have those at all. Talked about it to my dad the other day and all he said was that there are adults who don't have jobs and licenses so I'm still an adult. Missed the point. Yes, I'm over 18 but I live like I'm 15. I want self-sufficiency and to never need him again. I want to be able to go away and never ever need to come back.

I am working towards getting my license, and am able to get campus jobs easily (but getting a job is more difficult when I'm at my hometown for a few key reasons). I'm in the processes. I don't want advice towards that.

I'm just not sure how to get over the embarrassment of not understanding things. I'm still trying to learn but it happens a lot that my friends need to correct me about mundane things, like what to put in the dishwasher, or it gets brought up that I don't know how to cook, and just a lot of other things that are common sense which I just lack. I try to function, to show that I function, but keep messing up and I keep feeling worse. I want my friends to tell me these things (it's not even like they're mean about it either) because no one else will and wouldn't even know/think to ask about some of the stuff that comes up. I feel really ashamed. I wish I was earning money or doing something good or were skilled at anything basic instead of being useless and indoors."
7547,Long term relationship may be dissolving; I am a student and will need a place to live. What should I do next?,"My relationship of &gt;11yrs may be (amicably, so far) dissolving. Neither of us are fully sure, yet; we're in a ""we'll see how things go"" mode, right now. But I'd like to have some kind of plan in place in the case that we do separate because I don't think I'd feel comfortable remaining living with an ex-partner (even though he's stated it's an option for me) for any significant period of time. 

Some backstory: 

* I am 31. I have never lived on my own or even fully supported myself. I moved in with my partner shortly after we got together when I was BARELY 20 years old (we were long distance and didn't want to stay long distance) and I have been living with him ever since. We live in a property owned by his family, so we haven't had to worry about rent, etc, and the only bills I've needed to cover myself have been my phone, car insurance, etc. Somehow, despite that, I don't have ANY savings to speak of.
* I live in Los Angeles and would like to remain in the area for at least the next couple of years because of the following reasons:
   * I am a student with 1.5 years of university left before graduating, and I'd REALLY like to be able to finish it without having to move across country (to live with my family) and having to transfer credits to another school, jumping through all those red tape hoops, etc. That, and I just like the university I am attending and would rather finish there. 
   * I have finally found a doctor who listens to me like a human being (a rare find, I'm sure you all know) who I am reluctant to give up just yet.
   * I JUST started therapy with a specialist and have a lot of work to do. If I move out of state, I can guarantee I won't have the same mental health insurance coverage I currently do. 
* I don't have much income at all. And as I said, I live in LA, one of the most expensive places in the country. There is no way I could afford to live on my own as things stand right now, even with financial aid from school. 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. So. The first thing I know I'm going to do is contact my university and talk to them about any housing options they have available to me. I'd really prefer not to share a bedroom with someone at this point in my life (especially a teenager or someone in their early 20s), so I'm hoping they'll have some availability in one of the graduate dorms or some such for ""non-traditional"" students who aren't in their early 20s. But I honestly don't know if I'd be able to afford that even with the financial aid I receive.  


Aside from that, if we do indeed part amicably, my bf's family has a little tiny apartment that last I heard they were planing to Air BnB but have never gotten around to finishing (setting it up with furniture and a couple of minor repairs, etc). I could possibly ask them to rent that apartment and just live super minimally for a while without any furniture. What his family quoted to my partner and I a few months back when we were considering leaving our current residence was that we'd have to pay $500/month for rent, which is AMAAAZIIIING in Los Angeles. But like I said, I'm a student with very little income, so I'm not sure I could even swing that along with bills, food, car insurance, books/supplies for school, etc. I'd PREFER not to take fewer classes to work more hours because I've already been in school for 6 years and would like to just be DONE as soon as possible (also because the sooner I'm done with school, the sooner other options open up to me about where I might go if I'm ready to set aside my doctor/therapist, etc), but if that's what it comes down to then so be it. Gotta do whatcha gotta do.  


I guess my questions are:

* Where do I go from here? Just as someone who's never lived on their own before in the first place. I'm intimidated by the idea and would like to be mentally prepared if it comes to that point.
* Does anyone have any suggestions for affordable housing in LA that won't involve me sharing a bedroom with someone?
* I would actually also be open to other, more non-traditional and creative suggestions as well (for further down the line after I graduate). I am a budding metalsmith and have even considered buying a van and setting it up as a mobile work/living space so I can travel wherever I want and bring my work with me. I have also considered long-term volunteering or WWOOFing. I'm wondering if anyone has any other creative suggestions for free or almost-free housing along similar lines.

I've already been a year there, but I feel stupid coping with all the other lawyers, I just feel like I don't know a fkn thing and I'm getting it really hard to keep up with them, I just can't, I mean I know what I saw in school but real life is completely different. She also has a business partner (sort of) that plans on keeping the business for himself and there's my older brother, who is a very competent lawyer but he has a job, also, he has the strongest possibility of keeping the ""boss"" title after my mother retires, so as I can see from the future, I'm destined to be an employee forever there hahaha.

My mother is already tired, I can see that, but she is still working because she feels that if she goes now, the other lawyer will ""get"" over her law firm because well, I'm a trainee, I don't have enough experience or anything to keep it working and my brother won't leave his job for now. So basically she's there because I'm too stupid to take the lead and I will be devoured by the others.

Now, I also have an MBA degree because somehow I discovered I really like business administration, specially marketing, by the time I discovered it, it was too late to study a new bachelor degree so I just took a master's degree, and I'm actually good at it, I've done some work from time to time as an independent business advisor and I've done well,  Besides that, my husband studied the same and he complements everything I'm not (financial stuff) and I think we could really develop our careers together.

Now, as I'm already a lawyer and I already have an MBA, I'm thinking of getting a scholarship to Europe and study a program of international business law that I think could join my MBA and my law degree together in something that I actually like and -think- I'm good at. It would imply me and my husband being separated for one year, but we don't have a problem with that. I also think it's a great opportunity for my future because first and foremost; it's something I LIKE, also, it's a way of standing out in something not my brother or the other business partners do, besides the opportunity of working abroad. I think this could give me the option of doing something I like, I'm good at and that my brother and I can complement in the future, so we could share the same office but he would be in charge of his own cases and I would have mine.

Now, the problem here is that by the time I finish those studies, I will be 32/33 years old, and I've been told by my doctors that that's already an... Older age for having children, also more dangerous BLa bla, and I do want to have children, I could have children now but I don't think we can afford it by the moment, and I think I have an insecure future here. I don't want to have children ""just because"" now and then turn my life in a stressful bunch of nerves because I won't be able to afford it, but also,  I don't want to loose the opportunity of having children for maybe beeing too ambitious and let time pass on me.

I know 33 years is not as old as I think, but I may say that I have some hormones problems, so of I want to get pregnant I would need maybe one or two more years in treatment if I'm lucky.

So, what do you think?? Should I go for it or stay and fight with my brother and the other guy to get a spot here? I think this will be a real watershed in my life.

TL;DR: I want to study a master degree that I think will help me get a better life but I'm afraid that by the time I finish I'll be too old (or find too hard) to get pregnant. I want both things in my life, need advice."
7584,I don't know what's wrong with me,"On the surface, I'm sure I look like a real adult: I'm married, rent a home, have a cat. I know how to cook, I manage my own bills and I have a part time job, while attending university. I dress well and look presentable most days.

But I just don't feel like an adult. I'm lazy as hell and don't want to get out of bed in the morning - I'm talking not getting out of bed for an hour or more each morning. My poor husband has to beg me most mornings to move. Every night I go to bed thinking ""I will get up tomorrow morning when the alarm goes off"" - and then I *just don't*.  This is a problem regardless of how much sleep I get - I've tried with everything from 6 to 9 hours. I've tracked my REM cycles, and tried the r/xeffect and setting rewards and everything. I'm fine when I'm getting up really early for work, but for school or anything else, I'm awful.

I don't regularly shower (maybe every 2 or 3 days?), brush my teeth or my hair and it can be weeks between shaving sessions. I'm aware that it's less effort to shower and wash my hair, but here I am spraying dry shampoo all over myself for the third day in a row. 

I'm overweight (last year I lost \~15kg/33lbs), and I have a current gym membership. But the problem is that I just can't be fucked. Had myself an egg white omelette this morning, and a goddamn cookie for morning tea with a side of lamb samosas for lunch. I haven't used the gym membership in \~6 weeks and have probably put 7-10kg back on since December. I care so much about losing weight, but I just can't seem to give a shit about doing any of the things to achieve what I want.

I don't really know where I'm going here, unless someone has a miracle trick to make me an adult. Please help."
7620,"What would you do if you accomplished everything, or mostly everything, you've wanted to do in life?","At 18 I made a list of things I wanted to accomplish. At 22, I've done pretty much everything. Existential dread is creeping in. I've tried to celebrate my successes (degrees, car, no debt, saving up for house), but I just can't for some reason. I know it's very human to accomplish and then seek new challenges / it's against our nature to be stagnant, but the emptiness success makes me feel often encourages me to fail so I can feel I have a life purpose or something to aim for again... some kind of challenge that requires that I get up in the morning / do things differently. I started gardening to distract myself, but as a workaholic, I've researched it a ton and picked up on it quickly. My garden is doing very well, and again the success makes me feel lost in life. My only remaining goals are travel, music production, and getting a house -- I'm chipping away at them all now. I've been trying to come up with a new list of goals, but I'm such a simple person that I can't imagine wanting more. Maybe that's just it. Maybe I'm lost cause I don't know what to want after this?

What would you do if you accomplished everything, or mostly everything, you've wanted to do in life?"
7675,[question] How do I find roommates?,"I know this is silly. I've lived with several roommates over the course of 3 years before, but my ex was always the one who did the initial hunting. He was very particular so I left it to him. 

Currently I live with my parents and want to find a place with a few roommates (cheaper). I just don't know where to begin."

7691,Is there a good class I can take on money management and finances?,"It's embarrassing that I'm 27 and still don't understand basic things about finances. I try to learn on the internet, but so much I still don't understand. My husband and I are trying to pay off all of our debt (student loan, car, hospital bills) before saving for a house. 

I never cared about this stuff until I had my son and now I'm like ""omg! I don't know why I waited this long to think about this stuff! There is so much I don't know and need to learn""."
7701,Oh dang oh no I don't know how dating apps work,"I'm on a dating app and I'm talking to two people and I can't stop thinking about one of them and the other seems like we'd be buds and I don't know how to handle this
Probably keep chatting but like how 
I feel bad if I'm leading the guy on, but I don't know what to do

I think I've also come to the conclusion that I'm not into men entirely so there's that too so now I need to find a new label cause pans not going to work anymore and it's 12:30 am and I'm freaking out I'll probably be calmer in the morning but I'm too wired to sleep."
7706,Never Got An Insurance Card? What's An Insurance Card!?,"Bit of backstory. School never taught me any of this stuff about buying a car and getting insurance and the like. My mom get's easily frustrated with me not knowing, I don't know where to go to learn about any of this, she does things for me without telling me.   
I bought my car and my mom told me I was covered by her insurance for the moment, but I'd just pay her $100 a month for it to go towards their payment. So I agreed. She'd told me if I'd go out and get my very own insurance It'd be costing me about $500 a month considering my car was brand new and I was a new driver.   
Fast forward and one day she tells me that I can finally have my own insurance for just $100 a month. And I think it's great! Adulting I guess. She nods and actually has it all set up for me so I'm like. Okay. That's chill. I get it in my head that Insurance is really easy and you can just go anywhere and type stuff online and boom your good to go.  
I've only talked with my Insurance person once when I was telling them where to take the money out of my bank and that sort of stuff. I later got sent a packet of stuff from them in the mail, just a bunch of information my mom said I didn't have to read. And I also got a DVD.   
FAST FORWARD MORE NOW.  
I get a letter from the BMV saying I never gave them proof of my car insurance so their suspending my license next month. But they never sent me any request for proof? My mom is frustrated even more with me for not knowing I had to do that but I seriously never got a request or a letter or anything. And now she's telling me I need to show them my Insurance card? But what's an Insurance Card?? I never got that either!? I have car insurance! I pay them each month. But how can I send the BMV proof? I don't own a printer to send them whatever the heck an Insurance Policy Declarations is. Or a letterhead? What's a letterhead!?   
Now I'm searching everywhere for that packet!"
7709,What official information are you supposed to know about your SO/spouse?,"I'm not married or engaged yet, but my SO and I plan to get married next year. I was just filling out a job application and I got to the part where you put in your social, and then thought to myself, ""I don't know SO's social. Am I supposed to know SO's social? I should probably know SO's social if we're gonna be married, right?"" And I'm neurotic and have ADHD so of course I get distracted from the application by wondering what all I'm supposed to know about him that we don't generally know about the people closest to us. So I should get his social, right? And license plate number and car make and model in case his car ends up at the bottom of the ocean, right? Do I need to know his license number? Blood type? I don't even know my blood type. Side question: how do people find out their blood type? Do I need to know my blood type?"

Thanks in advance for helping a new adult."

7723,Landed my dream job but it doesn't pay shit.,"Okay, so... a bit of back-story. I'm a returning college student. Late twenties, undergrad. In a competitive field in the area (conservation biology, specifically fisheries). I went to college for something I didn't care about before, dropped out, and have been working an ""okay"" 9-5 job since then. My current job pays quite well. I am married and it has definitely been a benefit to my family that my husband and I both have decent incomes. Anyway, I took a risk and applied for a job with the local department of conservation that I never thought I'd get, and that undergrads like..never get. I don't know why I went for it, but I did, and I found out yesterday that I got it. It's kind of a dream job (research on an endangered fish species for those of you that are nerds). I asked for time to consider. Why, you ask? Because I was a) in shock...I never, like really never, thought I'd get it in a pool of dozens of applicants. Also, the pay is...bad. Like, real bad. It's with a government funded agency that get so little funding it's almost embarrassing. It's also a temp job, so at the end of it I may get hired on, but maybe only part-time. It also doesn't include benefits. 

I just don't know what to do. It's an amazing opportunity and in my field this kind of experience is paramount if you want to go to grad school, which I do. But I have a family, a mortgage, car loan, etc. I'm scared to talk to my husband about it because I know what I want to hear but also what he will probably say (which is reasonable... ""What if we can't afford it?"", ""What about when the temp period is up?""). I'm at a loss. Any advice is appreciated. "
7738,Do I need to be paying taxes?,"I'm 19 and a college student, I make about $2000-4000 a year. I've had part time jobs for the last few years, but have never paid taxes. I was under the assumption that since I'm a dependent I didn't have too, but I don't know if I qualify as a dependent anymore?"
7763,"Wanna get a car, but I kinda don't know how.","I got a job and did some math and can save up for a down payment on a car. But I only have my permit. I also don't have insurance yet. What order do I do this? I'd think I should get a car, then insurance, and then lessons, but I can't get a car without a license or insurance. Can't get insurance without a car as far as I know, and as far as taking the test goes I'd rather practice and take it in my car. What do I do?"
7791,How do I buy a flat?,"I want to buy my own flat. I already have more than enough money for an initial deposit in order to take the loan. However, i have no idea how to buy it. Basically, I feel like an easy target for any real estate agent who would profit from me. I don't understand anything about flats, I don't really know my needs and what to check when buying it. I don't know good vs bad loan rates. And because of this, I am delaying this decision without doing anything, thus losing money. Any tips?"
7843,It's nice being able to make friends with people of all ages.,"I don't know if this was the case for everyone else, but when I was growing up it was frowned upon to be friends with people who who much younger or older than yourself. Parents thought that if you hung out with older people they were a bad influence and if they were younger you were delayed or something stupid like that. 

It can be hard to make friends as an adult. It's nice to have a bigger group of potential friends and to be able to go to an older friend for advice or have a younger one remind you to have fun. I never thought the first friend I would make in college would be ten years older than me."
7859,need help filing W-2. do I need my previous year? second time doing this,"so long story short, I worked at my current job for a year now and got my w-2. I had a previous job the previous year and had a W-2 then.

I'm using Turbotax i believe, and they asked if I filed for 2018, which I'm assuming yes since, again I did it last year.

since I'm a huge idiot, I misplaced it somewhere, and now I don't know if I need it or how to get another copy digitally.

anyone got any advice?"
7880,I Escaped Apartment Charges Post Move Out,"I wanted to brag about this little accomplishment and thought this was the best place to do it, so here we go! TLDR at the bottom.

To set the scene, I moved to a college town last year. This was my first time out of my parent's house, but I've moved so much I already knew the drill: take pictures of everything on move in day, and fill out the inventory condition sheet. The complex I moved into was student housing and came with furnished apartments. The place was your typical cheap, shitty first apartment.  I'll give some more details later. 

My boyfriend and I spent much more time and effort than I would have liked cleaning the place and making it livable on move in day. Our roommate had already moved in, but there was an amount of filth that he couldn't have created himself in his short time there, and I guess he wasn't bothered enough to do something about it. 

Throughout our time there, there were numerous maintenance issues that took weeks to resolve. Even when new management took over, nothing improved. I hated that place so much, I couldn't wait to move. 

Fast forward to move out day, I tell my boyfriend I'll spend 30 minutes cleaning the place after we get everything out. The place was already relatively clean and I felt that was all they deserved, given the circumstances at move in. My boyfriend tells me not to clean it all, but I was being safe so as not to be charged. I declare that there's no way we're getting charged for anything. 

A few weeks later, I get a letter in the mail. We've been charged $60 for carpet and $65 for cleaning. Bitch! I vacuumed the damn carpet, and I cleaned that damn place. I send an email to dispute the charges, stating that I cleaned the place, and it was way worse when I moved in. They send me an email back with a picture of my room, a picture of a trash bag with what appears to be the window blinds from my room inside, and the microwave handle. My dispute has not been approved. 

I email them back saying I don't know what the first 2 pictures are supposed to say (there was no visible problem with the carpet or blinds), and the microwave handle was already broken when I moved in. My exact words were ""Are the inventory sheets not referenced when they are doing the apartment checks? My understanding is that the purpose of that document was to protect me from this sort of thing happening. "" I also attach some photos of the place from move in day. There were spider webs and eggs on the underside of the couches they provided for us, and the oven was caked in filth to the point of it being a fire hazard. 

I got an email back the next business day saying my dispute was approved. Honestly, that was probably a better feeling than if I hadn't been charged at all.

TLDR: My apartment tried to charge me for cleaning when I moved out, so I sent them pictures of the spiderwebs and eggs on the furniture that they provided, and filthy oven from my move in day."
7889,What kind of stylus pen should I get for my new HP laptop?,"Hi all! 

&amp;#x200B;

Not sure if this is the correct sub to post on but I couldn't think of another one that might be able to give me the same advice. My birthday was two days ago and my boyfriend bought my a laptop I've been wanting/needing for a long time. I got an HP Envy x360, I love it. I always wanted a laptop I could fold and flip into a tablet and write one. I work for a law firm and review and edit a lot of documents and this new laptop is a lifesaver. 

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAY, since this is a laptop that has Microsoft Ink and can be used as a tablet as well, I was wondering what the best stylus pen is to purchase for this type of laptop? I'm not exactly knowledgeable when it comes to technology so I don't really know what I'm looking for. I've done some research and can't seem to find a solid answer for what the best one to use is, I can't even find a good one made by HP with decent reviews. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really love this laptop and want to take care of it so I want to get a stylus that is adaptable with this laptop but I honestly don't know what to be looking for. I would really appreciate any suggestions. I plan on using this laptop very frequently to take meeting notes and revise documents so a really effective pen would be AMAZING!"

I can either have my stuff shipped via crate, and fly there with my cat (Although I'd prefer NOT to do this option) Rent a U-haul that will cost me at least 3k,  not including gas or insurance on the truck, or buying myself a car (because I havn't had a car since my roommate and I share one, but its his) and renting a tow trailer for no more than 500$.

7917,Bad neighborhood + increasing loneliness = me going crazy,"TL;DR at bottom


I don't know if I just need to vent or need advice or what, but I am going crazy. 


So I (22F) moved out in March after I got married. My husband and I bought a house in a small rural town about 15 minutes from my parents. It was nice at first. We did a lot of renovations, painting etc, and it was fun and excited. We kinda stopped after we both started working longer hours and only have about every other weekend together. Our walls still need painted, porch needs fixed, linoleum needs replacing, etc. It's still livable but not super homey. 


A few months after living here, someone moved into the empty house next door. Didn't have an issue with them, or anybody, as we are friendly, but try to keep to ourselves. Turns out, that guy was already living there, but he just got out of jail/prison and was back home. He's friendly to us when we see him, but he's always walking around the neighborhood, shirtless, and sometimes holding a baseball bat. I've seen him yell at the guy across the street. I'm pretty sure he and his gf/wife are always high on something, not to mention their loud arguments. Their electricity doesn't work. It's all just a little sketchy. 


We noticed a few small things get stolen off the porch, like water bottles, over the course of a few days, then our gas can on the porch was taken. And then the one in the shed was taken. We made a police report, but they just told us we should put up cameras if we can. A few nights later I was home and my dog just starts barking like crazy at the front and side door. I am paranoid already, but I go outside and don't see anything. Well the next day as my husband is leaving for work, he notices some dirt smeared by our front door. Like someone had brushed up against the house. My husband got to thinking and stood on the door jamb, holding the frame, looking in the little arch window on the front door. Sure enough, same place where the dirt was. 


So I got that contact paper stuff that still lets light in, but you can't see in or out. We've also gotten a couple cameras, door and window alarms, and those poles you wedge under the doorknob to prevent someone from opening the door. I AM STILL TERRIFIED. I have probably listened to way too many true crime podcasts, maybe watched too much Dateline and First 48, but I am still not comfortable in my own home. 


On top of all that, I am so incredibly lonely. My husband and I work opposite shifts. So I work in the morning, come home, see home for maybe half an hour, then he leaves, comes home while I'm sleeping, and if he's able, he'll stay up and see me while I get ready to to to work. Most nights he's too tired to stay up, so I only see him after I get off. That's if I don't work over. He gets weekends off, but my schedule varies, and I'm working at least 2 weekends a month. Whenever he leaves, I just get so sad because I'm home alone (in a house I'm scared to be in anyway) and I start really missing living with my parents. I am really close to them and my brother, so I'll be thinking about them and text them when I'm feeling really lonely, and they are not great at getting back to me. Or the conversation is super dry. Mostly cause they just aren't big on that. But in person, it's a lot better. I go over there a lot to ease the loneliness, but I feel like a burden sometimes cause I don't live there anymore and I have my own house. 


My 2 best friends live 5 hours away from me, out of state. I've lived here for 3 years and made a few friends a work. Nobody I can really connect with though. I try to clean and pursue school and my hobbies, but most nights I get so sad that I just lay in bed on my phone, hoping I'll fall asleep soon so I don't have to feel this way. 


Moving is on the table, but not possible for a while. We're getting ready to put up more security cameras as well. I really tired of being here and think my mental health has really taken a toll. Some nights I'll just sit and cry by myself because I'm so sad or scared. I dont know what to do. My husband says nothing will change if I don't change it. I do agree, but I can only do so much. I don't wanna be the kinda person to feel sorry for myself either. So I don't know what to do or how to feel. If someone has some feedback or advice or even critisism on this whole situation, please let me know. I'm just sick of it all. 


Tl;dr... I don't feel safe in my house plus I'm am increasingly lonely and miss my family. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do."

My interests lean in art but I don't even know if I'll continue liking them in the long run because I suck at it. I'm a shut in not because of lockdown but because my parents discouraged me to go to parties or events that are outside of school. I'm so bad in my interpersonal skills which makes me have less friends. I'm currently enrolled in ICT Programming but man, I hate coding.

8033,How do I even begin?,"How can I become an adult?

Hi! I'm a 19-year-old currently living with my parents. I will say they tried their best. They really did. But they are still not exactly the best parents... hence me being here. I was homeschooled as a child and barely had anyone other than my family to be around. The only exception was homeschool groups, which we changed every year, and church. So needless to say I was sheltered. (Also I posted basically this exact same thing in r/raisedbynarcissists . The only difference is the other one just has more of my family history if you want to go look.) 

Long, long story short I'm grown. I'm 19 and I still live with them. They think that they taught me how to be an adult, but they didn't. I love them. I truly do. They have gotten a lot better over the past few years as far as them being... not the greatest, but they did the very classic switch that has thrown a lot of people like me off. Expecting me to go from the infantilized version of me they made to a brand new adult version of myself over night. 

I don't have any life skills from being sheltered and homeschooled growing up. I have depression, anxiety, and a SLEW of other issues. But I'm trying my best to put myself out there. I got a car! I got my license this year and driving that thing has opened up *so* many happy moments. If I could I would *never* leave my car, I love the feeling of freedom so much. 

But also, I don't have a job. And due to COVID along with worsening deoression episodes I'm flunking community college. (It was free with a scholarship, but now it's gone.) And now my parents are threatening to throw me out. Well, throw me out makes it sound more sudden than it is. I have until New Years to be fully out of the house or else they're making me go on my own and not give me any time to pack my things. I honestly don't know what to do. I don't know how to live outside of this house, much less without my family. 

I always *imagined* moving out, but never really had a lot to help me plan for it. All I have is $500 in my emergancy fund, $100 in my spending account, and my car. How do I go out and live, especially without a degree? What are things you wish you knew about adult life and leaving behind your families when you were younger? 

If you made it this far, thank you. Honestly, thank you. I hope you have a wonderful night, day, or afternoon."
8064,I'm confused,"What's the stimulus check for? I can't think of any reasons except for my age. I'm still dependent on my mom and not adulting at all. I filed separately to get my own because it was mail in my name, I'm not working/ never worked and did that instead of my mom claiming me as a dependent. What's the check for? To be used for anything? I'm confused. I was thinking I'll just give it to my mom or save it? I don't know."
8067,How to answer income question on apartment application if I don't know yet?,"Hi, my BF and I are about to move to a new state and found a great potential apartment. We've seen the application for renting and there is a question about income for both of us.

I'm also about to get an offer (which I will accept) from a job I really wanted. It just has to go through HR approval. I don't know about salary yet as that is currently being worked out by the HR, and right now at my part time job I make about $1250 a month. But I will be leaving that job when I move. It is not enough to cover the new rent but my BF makes more, theoretically enough to comfortably pay rent each month on his own and still have money left over.

What do I put on the apartment application under where they ask what my income is?"
8081,"Getting kicked out, now what?","I'm 24 (F) getting kicked out unexpectedly because my grandparents are scared of getting covid from me. I dont know what to do now. Iv never lived on my own, I'm a bartender, I dont want to stay here because I live in a small farming town in the middle of BFE. I have a highschool eduction and an associates degree, no life skills, no dream, no passions, interests, life direction or even a hobby. How do I decide where I want to move? What do I do for a job? I don't know where I want to live, I don't know where to apply for a job or even what kind of job I could get besides bartend/waitress. I dont have family in other states besides my parents but we are not on speaking terms. I have no friends or a partner so I have nothing tying me down anywhere. I have freedom and I dont even know where to begin on using it. How did you decide where you wanted to live when you first left home? Do I throw a dart at the map and hope I like it and it works out? I'm overwhelmed."
8088,Should I move out?,"I am 27M, currently laid off from work, still living with my parents and have no relationship nor any friends. 

We recently moved into my new house (I took a 30 year loan for this). Currently my whole family is living off my savings. I have been the sole source for the last seven years. 

I did not care about money until recently since I got a relatively good paying job. I just take a small fraction from my paycheck for my personal expenses (food, toiletries, rent) back when I was living in my apartment. Then a huge chunk of it goes to my parents. Anything left I put into my savings.

But ever since the pandemic hits and i got laid off, i had to give up my apartment and live with my parents. I used to think because the house was under my name, and I will be paying for it for years that I should be ok living here.

But turns out its not. Everyday I feel like my condescending parents are hating me for being a freeloader. But I assure you I'm not. I am still the sole source of money (even if I don't have work). I had paying for the bills, the house, food and whatsoever.

The sad part is, all our relatives keeps dropping by. They eat our food, asks for money, and sleeps here too. I usually can't do anything but entertain our guests. Mom spoils them.

Another problem, my grandma got sick and I had to shoulder all her medical bills too. She stays with us now. I had to take care of her. It would have been ok, i love my grandma and I have no qualms taking care of her. But she keeps on inviting more and more relatives to come visit her. I end up not being able to do anything I want in my own house because its always filled with people I had to look after for. I can't even play video games anymore. (yah, adult &gt;_&lt;)

Now my savings are depleting. I had to do something or we all are going to be penniless soon. I had talk to my parents about this but everytime I do I become the villain. An ungrateful selfish disappointment. Mom always get angry at me lately. Everytime I say something, she'll burst. She'll complain can't she do anything without my permission and I'm trying to manipulate all her actions. But all i want is to limit our expenses, just a bit. But she'll manage to turn me into a heartless human being.

I wanted to leave. Just pack up my things and never comeback. But I can't. For one, it's hard to find a new place without notice specially due to lockdowns. I don't have friends or anyone else who can help me out. And second, i feel like i'm leaving a huge responsibility. Running away is not an adult thing to do. Right? And lastly, I love them. I don't know how they'll survive without me. 

Should I stay in my house and endure this kind of treatment? I don't know anymore. Adults, kindly help this man-child decide what's the adult thing to do?

Edit: Thanks for all the advice. I voiced it out today, but I haven't finished telling them my sentiments we received a more pressing news. 

My uncle is now taking my parent's old house. are He is giving them a 1 week notice to take all their things or he'll throw it out the street. My dad is now begging me to allow them to take all their stuff into my house. How can I refuse?

Maybe at least now, we'll have less visitor because my house will look like a storage unit for sure because my parents are hoarders and there won't be any space to accomodate sleepovers. Now they won't have anywhere to go to. And they want to put all their stuff in my house too. I'm thinking more of leaving them here, I'll continue to pay for this house but I can't handle anymore drama.

Life really finds way to kick you when you're down and if you try to stand back she'll stab you too. :("
8095,Someone hit my parked car,"I've never had to file an insurance claim. I found a piece of my front end, a note and a big scraped bumper. What steps do I need to do now? I called the person on the note, but they haven't gotten back to me. I don't know if the car is driveable. I looked at my insurance website, but the claims seem to be for moving accidents. I wasn't driving and didn't see anything."
8098,How to quit a job online?,"This is silly I know but since covid started our company has sent us to work from home. Im quiting my job and it feels weird on how to do it. Do I just write it up in and email or like have a phone conference with my supervisor then tell them? It also feels awkward cuz during the shift to home we all got new supervisors so I don't know them. 

I've never actually left a job properly I use to have a lot of under the table jobs but this is like an actual corporate company and Idk how to leave professionally on a good note."
8105,I got a job! With Insurance benefits! Yay! Now what?,"Hello! First-time poster :-) I recently (yesterday) enrolled in my health insurance with the company I'm in, and it states I'm able to use these benefits immediately. I desperately need a new pair of glasses. The insurance says that I won't be getting an ID card for the visual side of it (Medical/Dental/Vision), but... how exactly/what exactly do I do to use my benefits at the eye doctors? 

What I do know: Where my prospective eye doctor will be, how much the insurance covers (Yearly exam and up to $130 frames), and a group number. 

What I don't know: Vision insurance ID number (?), The process of using the benefits I signed up for. 

I'm fresh out of college and have never had a full-time job till now! Health insurance should absolutely be a thing taught in school, I am fully lost. I'm at least grateful that the company I work for made the process of choosing the benefits so easy. 

I've looked at a couple of different subs regarding stuff like this and it's only made me more confused. I feel as if it would've been easier if I had an ID card for it but I'm not sure what to present to the eye doctor as proof... Anything would help, thanks!"
8108,How often do you write checks?,"I'm 26, I work full time.  I pay all of my own bills as of a year ago, and so far I'm killing it.  I'm really proud of myself for handling things so well.  One thing that constantly frustrates me, though, is check writing.

I've written checks very rarely in my life.  To pay my rent, I go and get a cashier's check (the money is immediately debited from my account by the bank).  I recently started taking a class, and I wrote them a check for my first payment when I was paid on 10/31.  It's now 11/13, and they still have not cashed it.  On my budget, this payment is the only outstanding thing.  It irritates me so much, and I wish they would just cash the damn thing.  I don't know why people hold onto checks so long.

In the future, I'm giving these people either a cashier's check, or just an envelope with cash in it.

Do you deal with checks much?  How do you feel about them?"
8112,How do I get a primary doctor/dentist/therapist/etc?,"I'm a 24F, and I have insurance for the first time in my life through work. But I have no clue how to use it or where to even begin.

Growing up we were very poor, so I never went to the dentist, hardly ever went to the doctor unless it was urgent, etc.

When I got to college at 18, I utilized the student health center for birth control, illnesses, counseling, etc. Since graduation, I've relied on good luck, healthy habits, and urgent care/health department.

Now that I have insurance through my new job (Cigna &amp; Delta Dental), I have ZERO clue about how to use it. I got a pamphlet from HR but it's so much info and I don't know how to make sense of it. I just want a person to help me understand it. I received insurance cards in the mail. 

My top priorities are: Getting a Primary Care Physician, Dentist, Gynocologist, Chiropractor, and Therapist.

Do I just call local offices and ask if they take my insurance?

When I finally go, do I pay when my appointment is over or do I pay later?

These may be silly questions, but I was never taught and I feel like I'm too old now to ask because I shouldn't have gone without it for this long. Help!"
8155,Will move out alone and the new house is a mess - help?,"My further family has been taking care of me since I dropped out of college, but I got a job and need to move out. The rent of housing here is normally  &gt; two-thirds of my wage, so they arranged a cheap apartment I can stay until I can afford better. The situation of this house is it hasn't been lived in for months and nobody took care of it, it's all pests and mold. Even before the previous family moved out, it was already in disrepair. The landlady seems to be trying to hand over the problem to somebody else.  
  

I don't mind the looks nor do I have much choice, but there's a number of points that really worry me:  
- I don't know what the fixing expenses are nor how long it'll take. I don't know what the landlady is like as a person. What if she has me and my family pay to make the house liveable and then throws me out? The whole thing seems like a pretty informal arrangement.    
- I have zero experience maintaining a house (let alone one in this state)  
- There's no security whatsoever (no bars on the windows, no walls in the yard, the backdoor is splinters). I rely on electronics to do my job so I'm concerned about that too, but I'm worried most about whether my dog will be safe. He looks way too fancy, what if someone snatches him?  

I trust the people who are taking care of me. However, I think they can be naive. I'm worried the remodeling might get widely underestimated since I've no idea what I'm doing and they're not the ones shouldering the debt if it goes wrong.  

Some numbers:
- I earn less than 900€.
- The rent of ready-to-live-in houses is about 600€.
- The rent of that place would be 150€.
So doing some best-case-scenario estimates, I guess to make one year living there more worth than regular rent, the total I spend in reparations should be less than 5.000€, or 10.000€ if I intended to stay two, etc? Can I possibly make a house liveable with 5k in a few months as long as the walls are not collapsing? I'm pretty lost.

Tl;dr: I'm moving into an apartment that has been neglected for ages and idk what I'm doing"
8195,How do you force your body to accept your new sleep schedule?,"My job has aparently decided I am ONLY doing 7am shifts from now on. I used to be a closer, working varying shifts always between 3pm and 11:30pm. The last several weeks I've had maybe 2 or 3 shifts that started after 9am. 

I am a night owl, there's no two ways about it. I can get myself into a sleep schedule that has me waking up early, but short of drugging myself, I can't keep it. I'll get in bed at 8-9p, and I'll end up staring at the ceiling for hours, watching the clock tick by. If I'm not EXHAUSTED, I *can't* seem to fall asleep before 2am.

I've tried white noise/ASMR, melatonin, silence, getting it as dark as possible, exercise, showering....... nothing gets me to sleep when I want to except benadryl and staying up for 20+ hours. I don't know what's wrong with me...

The reason I don't take benadryl at night is it works too well. I will sleep for 12+ hours and sleep through a freight train crashing through my living room. Obviously, if I'm getting up at 5am every morning to go to the bus by 6am to get to work by 7am, I can't stay up for excessive amounts of time unless I only want to be decently rested every other shift.

I have noticed that I have shifted towards a ""normal"" sleep schedule as I've aged, at 12 I was staying up until dawn whenever possible and sleeping all day, and now I naturally fall asleep almost precisely 2am-10am, if I don't set alarms. Will I keep shifting? Is there any way to make my natural sleep cycle shift faster? I just want to get enough rest that I don't fall asleep in the middle of counting opening tills."
8222,I feel awful. How do I get through this?," So I've been suffering from terrible back pain for the last three days. I went to a chiropractor which helped, he said that I have inflammation in my lower back and need to rest. I'm not really the type to stay in bed but I'm trying. To add to that, I'm on my period which is making me nauseous and very emotional. I just don't know what to do. 

 If I can get some advice or some words of encouragement, I would very much appreciate it. I just feel awful."
8252,I'm failing as an adult and I hate myself for it,"I just turned 33 and still depend hugely on my parents. I only recently acquired my own health insurance with my parent's help. I'm employed, but it's for my dad's company and basically a sinecure. I'm autistic and depressed. I'm finding it harder and harder to be happy for my friends as I have to watch them succeed at all the things I wish I could do. I'm terrified that I will inevitably be cold and homeless. I honestly don't know what kind of advice I'm looking for, I just had to say it. It seems like everyone else has the secret to how to be a responsible, productive adult, but I don't. I know all the things that I should do. I should exercise more, eat better, and commit to learning new skills even if it takes time. I just don't care enough. I care enough to be bitter, jealous and resentful, just not enough to actually change the way I live."
8265,"18F &amp; dorming, met someone who I want to be friends with but I don't know how to ask her to hang out. Help?","So, I'm dorming and this is my first time being by myself for an extended period of time. So the backstory is, I was wearing a band T-shirt and my lanyard is DND themed. I went to Michaels to pick up some canvasses and the cashier complimented my shirt and said it was one of her favorite bands and she likes DND too. I told her I just moved here and was looking for friends and covid and yadda yadda, so maybe we could exchange numbers and hang out sometime. We exchanged numbers and I'd like to hang out with her after Christmas break, but I'm not sure what to invite her to, how to go about it, etc? I was thinking about inviting her to get dinner but I don't want her to think it's a date  (also I kind of don't want to spend money? Christmas has me beyond broke.) Help?"
8273,Living on your own after college,"So because of the pandemic (and major depression) I'm home for college (and work from home) and in it longer than I wanted to be. I want to go out and live somewhere on my own away from my parent. What are some first steps into doing this? 

I have more than a few G's saved up, I have my own car (although I don't really use it because I live in NYC, but I want to live in Pittsburgh for a while). 

Is there preparation I should look into; find a job first around where I want to live? Stay home as long as possible and save even more money? Look for apartments or roommates so I can save even money until I get a better job?

I just honestly don't know how to start my ""real"" adult life at all."
8275,How the everliving fuck do you live on your own?,"I do not know how folks can move out so quickly. The last job that I had was minimum wage and I was laid off after just six months. I have no car, and no license. I don't have any higher education past high school and I cannot afford tuition. I need to move out at some point, but I don't know how I could possibly do that. I'm twenty-four. I cannot live the way that I do now. We do not have a shower, nor sufficient heat or water, nor do I have a bedroom.

I need to get out. But how? How do I move out in conditions such as these?"
8294,Can I just pay someone to clean under my fridge?,"Okay, sorry: I don't know if this is the right place to post but I honestly don't know where to start.

I rent an apartment and have a bad fruit fly problem and a horrible smell in my fridge and freezer. I finally think I've narrowed the problem down to my fridge's drip pan.

Had a cursory look underneath and I definitely want to vomit already.

Can I hire a refrigerator repair person to remove the pan and clean it? Is that a service that's offered? I know this sounds very precious but besides the revulsion, I also don't think I have the tools to remove the plate, and I'm not sure I know how to, either.

My landlord will not assist; he doesn't landlord.

TL/dr: Can I hire a refrigerator repair person simply to remove and clean my drip pan?"
8316,"When and how to start ""adulting""?","For context, i am an 18 year old girl in the UK with autism. I've always had struggles with routine since i was young. However, despite this, my mother has always been telling me that ""I need to be doing more"" but I have no idea what she means by that.

I don't know if she means that I need to exercise more on my journey to lose weight, if I need to be doing more cleaning and odd jobs around the house, or if I need to be doing more regarding getting a job.

Considering the pandemic, in my head, things are at a standstill and I'm struggling to know where to begin regarding jobs and setting up a routine. I have already installed an app to hopefully keep me on track with college work during said pandemic but besides that, I don't know when to start.

If any of you have any ideas regarding jobs, how the UK job system works, or how to stay productive during quarantine, I would be amazingly grateful to all of you.

TLDR: I'm autistic and don't know how to be an adult or if I'm too young to start.

Please forgive me as I'm still new to reddit so I don't know how flairs work either."
8334,Moving advice,How do I get rid of a large metal bunk bed frame that no one would want? It's used and most of the screws are scalped (I don't know the right term) so I doubt I could put it on craigslist or anything. Any suggestions?
8368,Did I handle a fender bender correctly?,"I'm (M26) not really prone to car accidents, thankfully.  I rear ended someone on the highway years ago, I had to do a class and pay a big fine - since then I am the most careful driver.

I was at the grocery store today, leaving.  I back out, but the car in the next space didn't see me.  She starts backing out of her space, and backing up.  She backs up closer and closer - I honk, and then basically keep my hand on the horn and everyone in the lot around us are looking.  She just doesn't hear it and keeps backing up, until she hit me.  In hindsight I should have reversed, but I figured she would hear my horn.

We both got out.  Asked if I was okay.  She was like early 40's yoga pants, and had a teenage daughter.

They both got out of her van, I got out of my car.  We ask if eachother are okay.  She apologized, and said she could do the ""whole insurance thing"" with me if I want.  I looked and there was no mark on my car at all, their car was also fine (it's not like she was backing out really fast or with a lot of force).

I looked at things, and decided I didn't want to get insurance involved.  I only had a moment to consider things, but I decided this because (1) being a male in my 20's with a couple accidents, car insurance is expensive enough, and I don't need my premium to increase because of this accident.  And (2) I've always heard that in situations like this, even if a car backs into another, the car behind is always at fault because of rear-ending and such.  I don't have a dash cam that captured her backing into me, though I'm sure the store had cameras out.  I have heard of people backing into others, and saying they were rear-ended for insurance money, and I found it suspicious that both the mother and daughter didn't hear me honking.

We parted ways without exchanging any information.  I didn't even take down her license plate number.  I just didn't know what to do, and I feel really dumb.

After thoroughly examining my car, everything is fine and there isn't a scratch.  I don't know if I made the right decision though.

Should I have handled this differently?"
8406,20 Year old struggling with finding roommates,"Hey I'm going to be moving out on my own and all the roomates i was going to live with bailed at the last second but i still need to find a place to live.

I've already signed up for some roomate seeking apps like roomster and spare-room, but i don't know how well those will work to find a match for me.

8416,What's the deal with buying a car?,"I'm going to be 21 soon. I have a license but I never had a car. I don't have any family members or close friends to help me at all. I won't have a cosigner and I may not even have someone to go with me to buy one. I don't know anything about the car buying process. You can say ""get one with good mileage"" but that means nothing to me. I know at least it is best to buy a used car and ask for a pre-purchase inspection (?) What's the deal with car insurance? What is a loan and is it worth getting one? I don't even know what a ""good"" car is. Are there any step by step resources for someone who is completely on their own and has no clue where to start?"
8446,So... How do you get rid of a bunch of spiders in a patio?,"I'm terrified of spiders. It's a problem. When they're in the house, it's easy enough to use a long vacuum attachment to suck them up from afar. But I have an outdoor spider problem this time. I live on the fourth floor, and I have spiders all over my patio. They're building webs on the railing, and on my patio chairs, and I don't know how to get rid of them without spraying a ton of poison everywhere.

Please help. I don't know how to get rid of my patio spiders."
8482,Don't want to grow up and leave school,"I currently have a lot of mixed feelings. 

I am a 23 year old student, always been good at school and that's all i really know. It was all about school and it was easy. I was lucky enough to never had to pay for anything because my parents think it's their duty to get me what i need (school supplies, hobbies related stuff, clothes, cell phone, internet, computers, video games, books...) and as of right now, i live in a 2 bedroom appartment with a rommate. She pays everything she has to herself, works all summer for it. Me? My parents pay half of my share of everything. They even pay for our groceries sometimes. On top on this, they give me 100 buck a month. It is to say that, I am spoiled. Doesn't mean I'm ungrateful, because I am very aware of how priviledge I am. They keep telling me ""Focus on school, don't worry about everything else, keep studying."" 

I never worked a day in my life. Sure, i tutored a few kids a semester but it wasn't ""work"". Got a bachelor's degree then a Master's Degree that I am about to graduate from, in lockdown. The Master itself is a mess. I'm part of the first class ever. We're 10 people. We're a strong group of friends. The program isn't good, and it's all theory, academical stuff. I study the arts, because why shouldn't I, i like it? But it's a dead end without contacts, and we all thought this Master's would be the place to finally start meeting professional of the entertainment industry, because the teacher who enrolled us told us they had partners. That we would stop theorizing about art, but make it. Turns out we never did and we're about to leave college forever, without a clue of what we're about to do.

I say we, because we're all feeling stuck but what I get from this is that I don't want to grow up. And as much as i hated school the last two years, it was so easy to be a student that now... I already miss how simple life was. I don't know where I'm going to go, what I'm going to do. Every classmate and I want to keep studying, do another Mater's because our current one was a disppointment. One of my best friend applied to another uni, got refused because she lacks experience and her profile ""isn't strong enough"". But she worked so hard, 5 years of studying and she was told she wasn't good enough. Now, she has no plans whatsoever. She's a mess. I don't know what to say, because I feel like we're all on the highway and we're about to ran out of gas.

I am aware that every adult is winging it. I really do. Everyone is pretending they have their shit together, when in reality, they do not. I don't want to grow up, because it's so easy the way life is as a student. I lack experiences too. I feel like time is already running out, that I didn't accomplished anything. Which is my own fault, cause i never started anything. Never worked a day in my life, because I didn't have to. I have no clue where to go, where to start, what to do. Don't really want to, in the first place.  

Is it even worth it to keep studying? Teachers told us that we needed to figure out what we want out of of life, but how do we do such a thing? I have no clue what I want. They say it's our responsability to figure it out, as if we didn't know that already. We know that, that's what we have so much anxiety. Because we know we need to figure it out but we can't just say, we wish we knew. 

Life after college is scary. Adulting is scary. How does one find that thing that keeps them going? 

I'm applying to another another Masters because it's delaying the real world, and I'm scared. I've always been told I was good at school and now that it's about to end, I have no clue what I'm good at other and think and write essays.

 I'm smart, but I'm not street smarts. Where to go now, and what to do?"
8505,Maggots can live in your carpet,"I just spent an hour cleaning my floors, killing at least 2 dozen maggots and throwing out my rug. I am in my 30s and had no idea this could happen, but hopefully this is a lesson for you all in keeping your shit clean.

I live in an apt by myself and my dog. Ever since moving in, I've had a fly problem. I've taped up vents, boarded up the fireplace, and eventually had an exterminator finally come by and spray down the place in the fall of 2019. That seemed to help. But now that the weather was getting warmer, I've seen some flies and maggots come in. Nothing as bad as before, I thought it was due to leaving a door open or something.

Tonight I was making beef stock. It involves boiling beef bones for 5 hours. The house was filled with a lovely aroma. I took one of the bones and gave it to my dog, who took it to her favorite spot on the rug and started gnawing on it. I was watching her, just fascinated by it. Then I saw a maggot right by her paw. I thought it had come out of her mouth, so I inspected her mouth multiple times and didn't find anything. Then I thought it was the bone, but the thing is solid calcium and had been boiling for 5 hours. No way it was the bone. I killed the first maggot and just chalked it up as a one time thing.

Then it happened again. And another one popped up in a different part of the rug. I thought maggots were falling from the ceiling. I took a flashlight and started looking around the house. To my horror a dozen maggots were inching their way towards the kitchen. I promptly vacuumed, and when I got to the rug I started to see more. Then it hit me - they were IN the rug. I flipped the rug upside down and even more came out. I was nearly gagging. I rolled it up and promptly threw it out. Then I spent the next hour vacuuming the entire place - under couches, behind trash cans, everywhere.

Turns out the smell of the broth had lured them out. A fly must have laid eggs in the rug. I fucking hate flies and maggots and like to think I'm a generally clean person. I've laid on that rug with my dog. I still gag thinking about it. 

For months I thought these maggots were crawling in from outside or coming in through the vents. The next time you have a fly and maggot problem, check your rug.

Sorry I don't know if this is appropriate for this sub, but I felt like I learned a new lesson in keeping clean as an adult and would like to save at least one poor soul who is going through a similar problem."
8528,"I'm (23,f) stuck at a dead-end job and I don't know what to do with my life.","I am a recruiter at a small boutique firm. This is my first job out of college and I am currently 23. Its a very small firm under 10 people. There is little room for growth because of how small it is and the structure. The thing is, even if I did get promoted, I don't think I would enjoy the job anymore. I'm quite good at it and all my internal evaluative meetings have been pretty good with them emphasizing how much they love me but I just don't like recruiting. 
Recruiting in nature is a sales job, you're selling a job to candidates and selling candidates to a client. This requires you to be an extrovert or at least enjoy talking to people. I am really good at faking extrovertism but I hate talking to people. Or at least the way we do it. It all seems fake and forced and our firm just seems so picky and wastes people time. But on the other side of the coin, I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING WITH MY LIFE. I know now is not the time to make a move with the pandemic going on and I realize how lucky I am to have a job right now. I am so aware of that. But once this is all over (hopefully sooner rather than later), I want to explore opportunities. I just dont know what im good at. 

I think I want to go into product development for makeup. But even entry level roles require experience. I dont even know what im asking. But I guess maybe, do you think that it is stupid to make a transition like that especially after coming out of COVID?"
8554,"I fucked up, I need some help.","I'm a 19 y/o male who has been living with his parents since forever. These past couple years have been rough for me and my family... And it's 100% my doing. I have been struggling with depression and had been going to counselling, but I never was truly truthful about my condition due to being forced to go and didn't feel like it was a safe space. That's rather irrelevant, but it's the main catalyst that culminated into me smoking pot regularily and doing jack shit to better my life. Long story short my mother had caught me smoking in the house multiple times, and told me multiple times that she would kick me out. My mother had caught me today by finding all my paraphanalia while I was at work and informed me I am to leave our house when the pandemic is over. The worst thing about this is that I hadn't planned for this to happen as I hadn't been smoking recently but I'm not angry, I made my own bed and now I have to lay in it. I guess my main question is, where do I start? I started looking at rooms for rent, which seems like smartest option as I only work part time right now at a retirement home. I plan on selling my PS4, Gaming PC and Nintendo Switch Lite to cover the first months rent and save as much as possible to the point where I'm spending no money at all. I just feel so overwhelmed and It's even more stressful that I don't know when this thing is going to end in Ontario. It could be a few months to a few weeks and I'm just totally out of my depth, any advice is appreciated and I'd prefer to not have to rely on my friends for support."
8579,how do I live on my own,"oh boy. Hi guys! So I'm an adult with adhd, depression, and anxiety so I really struggle with learning. How do I even begin to live on my own? I dont have credit and I don't know how to prepare if I were to go rent my own apartment. I dont even have a license. This is kind of what I have for figuring things out, please feel free to add more:



1. Owning a (used) car: 
- I need car insurance
- gas money 
- buy a car with low gas milage because once its maxed out it can't be driven
- ???


2. What to know about taxes/bills:
- ????


3. Renting:
- create a budget
- set up utilities (i.e. electricity, water, gas, internet, cable)
- phone bill
- need credit (which I don't have and didn't know you needed) 
- so credit card/loan payments
- rent (need to make 3x the rent) 
- first and last months rent for a security deposit 
- groceries and furniture



Ugh."
8614,Do others get hesitant and second-guess with emailing about job opportunities? How do you get over this?,"Nearly every time I get a response back, it seems I spend an inordinate amount of time obsessing over how to word my email replies-it's not an exaggeration to say I spend an hour or more.

I think partly this is because it's often a first impression. I'm never sure how professional or casual to be, as I've been criticized for either being too casual or too rigid/uptight/mechanical, (for lack of a better term right now) or not showing at least a little personality.

Sometimes I think I shoot myself in the foot and say too much, possibly making myself look less qualified. I think this may have happened today for instance, (I said-not quite in this way-something about how, ideally, or if conditions permit, I'd like to study up on some of the material; I mentioned I've been doing some review on related, fairly transferable material, but hadn't quite gotten around to the more applicable material for this job. I'm afraid that may make it look like I don't know the material that well) and it's difficult to stop questioning how I may be perceived, if I made a mistake in presenting myself, etc.

Perhaps I could make more of an effort to talk on the phone instead? I've actually gotten better and more comfortable there, but good emailing is still an important and necessary. And I have noticed I still have a great deal of emailing anxiety, generally manifested by me continually re-editing, even when I'm familiar with the person. I even have this issue when emailing friends or family at times.

Do others experience this? What are some good ways to work on being more efficient, decisive, and less self-doubting with emailing or texting?"
8625,Want to move out of parents house during COVID,"Hi, I'm 19m years old and I was looking forward of moving out of my parents house later this year, but they won't let me because of Covid and I have underlying conditions.  They say if I get it then I would die and it's killing everybody and I would have to stay inside until they come out for a vaccine.

  I've been in lock-down since mid-March and my mental health hasn't been going well since then. My depression has come back and I don't know how long I can last and the only thing I can do is drive and stay inside the house.  

  I'm currently have about $20,000 in the bank and I go to online school full-time.  I found an apartment for about $600 to $700 a month. 

I was wondering if i even have a choice in this argument?"
8637,Rental Applications Help!,"I've never rented a house before and I'm overwhelmed. So you have to pay to apply, which seems like bullshit to me. If there are other applications pending, is it even worth it to apply? Should I apply to many or just one? It feels so competitive and expensive, I don't want to throw a bunch of money away. 
Also, during covid, many won't even let me see the house until I apply and am approved. But I don't know if I want to apply if I haven't seen the place!"

I have a Whirlpool fridge (WH31S1E) but it isn't cold and I don't know which way to turn the stupid knob to make it colder. It's currently at 7. The dial goes from 1-7 but I don't know if 7 is the coldest or the warmest. People keep giving me mixed answers.

Anything I put near the fridge door gets too warm and goes bad :("
8761,How do I move out and start life?,"Ok, so here's the situation: I (24M) want to move out of my parents' house. I'm gay, they're not cool with it, I'm tired of arguing about it, so I just want to leave. I'm not getting pushed out by my parents, but I don't want to live here anymore. Problem is, I'm closeted and my friends who I would ask to live with me probably wouldn't want to be friends anymore if they found out (I know you'll probably say oh but you don't know that! yes i do. they've made their stance on lgbt issues clear through the years i've known them). The limited amount of friends I have who do know I'm gay either don't live near me or already live with an SO. I have the financial means to live alone, but it's not preferable because I have some mental issues that make being alone kinda hard for me. I realize there are a lot of intersecting themes going on here, so I guess my questions are:

\-do i need to throw away the whole friend group and find new people? these are mostly my college friends who i have a lot of memories with, and i enjoy spending time with them, it's just clear they wouldn't really support this part of my life 

\-my family has told me if I choose this ""lifestyle"" they won't be a part of my life anymore. i'm slowly coming around to this, but does anyone have any experience/advice on starting a life for yourself completely from scratch?

\-where the heck do you find a sane normal person to live with if you don't know any personally/through your network?"
8763,How do I find a therapist?,"Like I don't even know where to start looking. Growing up, there was a lot of stigma from my family behind finding mental help (they'll take your guns, you'll be put on a list, etc). Now I'm moved out and married and I feel like I need help, but I don't know how to explain what I need? 


I have sexual trauma, anxiety; I always feel bitter and I have a fluctuating self esteem. I also have a medical condition that I will deal with for the rest of my life and it can get really discouraging sometimes. 


I don't know who, or how, to ask for help. How do I know what type of therapist? How do I know if they are a good fit for me? How can I find out how much it costs? What if it's too expensive? How do I even open up to a complete stranger when I'm already such an introvert? 


I need some guidance please!"
8779,Need help.. cleaning.. but I'm uh scared,"So.. my apartment has gotten disgusting. I have rollie pollies invading my place and well I don't like them and get distracted anyways and they've piled up in a corner of my apartment and I'm so disgusted by it that I avoid it.. so it led to me neglecting the entire apartment and well it keeps getting nastier, surprise... And I'm just so anxious about it now I can't sleep because it's nasty and I just don't know how to go about it. I have a mouse too somehow and I'm freaking out. Like I want to just burn the whole apartment down and leave instead of being an adult and fixing it. I need advice.."
8795,"What's your birthday ""gift“ approach when it's paying the birthday person's bill and there are others?","I'm going on a day trip to a national park and we'll also stop by an eatery along the way. 4 of us. One is the birthday girl. The trip is to celebrate her birthday.

I don't have a physical present for her. I don't want to get a physical present. I've never done ""it's on me"" as a gift before, but I'd like pay for her gas or for her meal. How do I casually and respectfully offer to pay while in the company of others? 

Then I've realized, I don't know what the other two are doing. However, no one I've seen do this kind of gift had consulted the rest of the party members in advance. They announced it as they were doing it. So it seems every woman for herself and hope no one else has your idea.

Definitely feel like I'm overthinking this, but I want to know. TIA!"
8830,"[15F] I'm gonna turn 16 in a few months, how do I get a job?","For personal reasons, I really, really want to move out of my parents house and go no-contact. The stress of being in that environment has been getting worse and worse, and it's been causing more severe health related issues.

I've been having a lot of anxiety regarding the future. I have so many questions, and I went here to a lot of subreddits and people suggested I ask a few questions at a time (To those who gave me advice earlier, thank you so much).

When I'm an adult, I want to be a chef and sell art as a hobby. Cooking is so calming and it's one of my favorite hobbies, and it's something I could definitely see myself doing. As for art, it's kinda been my ""thing"" throughout my life. I really enjoy drawing, but I don't know how I'd be able to sell my art.

When the time comes, I want my first job to be in fast food, but I don't know where to start. I have no experience and bad social skills.

When I was in confirmation, I did things like greet people at entrances and chaperone kids, both of which I was terrible at. If it was a job that required me to talk to/guide people I was always stuck in this strange loop of wanting to help, not knowing what do to, and being too afraid to do anything.
I don't know how I could convince someone to hire me if my social skills are awful.

And there's the whole ""what do I put on my resume, who do I call, what do I do if I can't find a job"" thing. What do I do?"
8896,Taking a job that pays less,"So right now I work at a bakery in a big grocery store chain. I don't like it very much but I didn't really expexct to and I know you're not gonna like every job you have. I make about 12/hr, work roughly 25hrs a week and I am part-time despite asking for full time often. I can't drive so my boyfriend has to drive me there AND take me home, 20min voth ways. My shifts are all over the place and I often get home clise to midnight. The work itself isn't that hard (although I am really sore at the end of my shifts) but my mental health definitely takes a toll.

Today I went into a local candy shop and I loved it in there, the lady behind the counter said they were hiring so I gave her my information. I could literally walk there every day it's so close to my house, they have a full time job available and I would be getting home by like 8:30pm every day. I don't know what the pay is yet, but I suspect it will be much lower than the $12 and hour I make at the bakery. I feel I would be much happier there at the candy shop, but if it pays less I feel like it would be stupid to take it, right?

I am working on creative projects that I feel would bring in money if I had the time to work on them consistently. Working at the bakery makes this difficult since my hours are never consistent, I can't develop a routine (which helps my depression and ADHD) outside of work. 

Assuming I would still be able to pay all my bills, do you think it's foolish to take a job that pays less even though I like everything else about it? I graduated in December and I want to go to grad school next year, so I'm not trying to build a full career in my major right now, just save money for grad school."

8923,I want to get out of a problem.,"Hello, I'm a starting adult and I just wanna get out of this problem that I'm having at my job. But first I have this background of being a bullying victim and i always put my defenses on whenever someone is doing something that I perceive is a threat.

I was at my Job and some woman (guard) and ask me my name. Due to that I am all but defensive and snapped back at her and my first instinct is to snap back at her saying this and that and flipped the bird at her.

Later I found out that she was an guard and I just violated a major rule of my company. I never meant to. So I'm now here is my problem. This is my first job as an adult and i don't want to be lose my job in this day and age. I'm having a trial about this incident from 5 days from now. 

I don't know what to do. I'm just frustrated and blaming myself for this. I just wanna go back in time and fix this mistake I made. I dunno what do after that. Pray to god to fix this mistake or bargain and beg at hr to not lose my job is my option.

I just want get like a lighter penalty and move on to this problem instead of losing everything that I have hard earned.

I dunno one mistake, is like a domino effect. Ever since then I've been losing performance at my job because I fear that the guards will take me and kick me out because I'm fired or something.

I talk this with my boss and told me if this doesn't work then I should have a plan b or something. Then after that I'm vision when dim and just cope with this situation that I just tear out and beg for this will be over.

I would even up to offer my salary to make amends for what I did. I just don't want to just get this problem out of control. 

I just want to get a get 1 free bail out for this thing and after that it was over, I'll avoid the guards for a plague and be done with it. I'll beg God to fix this problem.

Any advice about what should I do? Or even some tips on getting problems in this situation? I would do anything to keep my job and one day leave this company in pursue of a hire one with no problems what so ever."
8946,How do I get my wisdom teeth removed?,"I'm in college and my wisdom teeth are erupting because I put it off for too long in high school. There's a mild-to-moderate amount of pain, mostly in the gums but a little in the lower jaw. I don't know if it's a serious problem or not but should probably get some kind of professional to look at it. My usual dentist is in my hometown, hours away, and going back now would be impractical. I've never been to any dentists in my new town. Who do I go to to look at this and hopefully fix it? Do I find a normal dentist? An oral surgeon? And how do I find them, because google and yelp never really give much help in elaborating which dental offices offer what services. I basically just need a step by step instruction on what to do about this."
8956,How the hell do I keep my apartment clean without buying a ton of items?,"I recently moved into an apartment by myself. It's the first time I'm living alone, and while it's not big by any means (studio), it gets dirty / dusty so quickly! It's a new building too, so it's not like there is years of dust floating around. I have lived with roommates for many years, and while things got dirty just as quick, nobody really took the time to keep them super clean. 

As of right now, I have Chlorox wipes, a small [vacuum] (https://www.amazon.com/Dirt-Devil-Simpli-Stik-Lightweight-SD20000RED/dp/B002KCO96C), and that's about it. I've managed to keep it mostly clean by wiping things down on the daily. However, this is a waste of Chlorox wipes, and it doesn't even work that well! The bathroom counter and kitchen counters seem to get dusty within 2 or so days.. and Chlorox wipes seem to just spread the dust around. 

I don't know what supplies I need, but I want to keep my apartment clean without having to clean everyday. I also don't want to buy 100 items that are super specialized to make this happen. Oh, I am also a recent college grad so probably the most important thing is I don't want to drop a ton of money just to keep it clean. I grew up in a household lucky enough to have a cleaning crew come through every few days, so I never had to do this when I was young.

Could someone put me in the right direction? What do I need? What do I think I need but I don't? What's cheap that will help me keep my apartment clean? FWIW, the unit is vinyl flooring. However, I have a few rugs here and there (the small vacuum has done okay on these so far). 

Thank you so much!"

Recently I have been  starting with the greeting of the day depending on the time followed by a comma and on the next line write what I need to say. I'm a college student and mostly email professors/ advisors.

9039,What age do you start being an adult?,"I know the title might seem a bit ambiguous.  But seriously.  I'm a 34 yr old female, I have a good job (that I studied 8 yrs in uni for) I make ok money, enough to pay my rent and pay from paycheck to paycheck , and a little savings. Not enough savings to ever be able to afford a mortgage  just enough for a rainy  day. I cant ever see myself in a position  to buy a place, I've travelled and worked in a few places over the past 6 yrs I've been qualified. I like my life right now.2 years ago I moved to a foreign,  sunny country to work in the job I'm qualified in. And the contract might end in November.  I don't know yet whether it will be renewed. But , what I'm trying to say is.  I dont feel like an adult. Friends my age and older and younger  are getting mortgages, having kids, settling down. I don't feel old enough to do those things. To be honest I dont ever want kids, but I'd like to be able to get a mortgage rather than paying a 1/3of my wage on renting a studio flat. I love my little flat. It's the first time I've ever had a place that's just mine.  But I look at my peers and I wonder why I dont feel like them , I'm not excited to get married, or have kids, or have a mortgage. My retirement? Ill be lucky if I can retire before I'm 80 and I've moved to a few places so it will be all over the place. Is there as certain age youre supposed to adult at? I still feel a mess in my life. I work a really responsible  job in healthcare, but outside of that I still have the same mentality I did when I was 25. I'm drowning in adult ness.

9064,Moving Out at 19 and living on my own,"Hey Guys, I am 19 and I am living in the suburb area, 30 minutes from my main city. I am currently a sophomore at  University in my main city but I missed out on the opportunity to live on campus freshman year because I thought it would've been smarter to live with my single mom. It's been a year and half since and to be honest with you, haven't been in the best place mentally, more specifically feeling stagnant has damaged my productivity especially during quarantine. Before all this, i was going at a great pace I'd like to say so, just happy overall and looking forward to moving out but since my classes are all online, I'm having a hard to focusing on my life. 

This is where my question comes. How smart/dumb of a decision is it to move out during something like this, especially for the first time. To give you more context, I have a few job interviews in the downtown area, and based on my salary, rent shouldn't be too bad. I also a good amount of money saved from Federal Unemployment compensation as well. 

I originally planned to move out w a friend but he canceled in the last few weeks. I just find myself feeling extremely stuck, and with my mom and grandma at home, freedom is really hard to get back. Being a 19 old south asian male, I can't even go out past 11:30 without getting at-least three calls from my mom. I wouldn't say she has a huge grip on my life, but definitely would like to say that moving out  would give me the freedom, which means  I will need good self discipline. Something i hope i can develop by being independent.   


I am really having a hard time making a decision because deep inside I really want to move out, but at the same time I don't know what to expect of it. I just feel that being home all day is just going to make me complacent as a person and extremely lazy, as thats how i feel lately. Someone please give me advice."

A few weeks ago, an ""emergency"" flight became available to my parent's country, and I chose not to get on it because I felt my mental health would suffer more in my parent's house because of the tighter lock down, my parent's busy work schedule and the fact that I don't have any friends on that side of the globe. My parents weren't happy with my decision but respected it, and now it's looking like the next time I'll be able to see them is the Christmas holidays, making it a year between the times we'll have seen each other in person.

I stand by my decision, but I still miss them and feel the pain of the separation. I know that part of being a grown up is seeing out the hard choices, but I don't know how to feel sad for what I've lost and happy for what I've got at the same time. How do I miss people I love when I've chosen not to be with them?

Don't know if this is just emotional word-barf, I just can't seem to stop second guessing my decision."
9203,Seriously considering moving out of florida,"It's a garbage state, and I have no sentimental attachment to it other than that my folks live here and I live with them. I'm considering trying to find an apartment somewhere, either in colorado or oregon. But I have no clue how to make those steps in between. And no, I don't know anyone in either of those states. 

Is it better to try to job hunt in the area and get a job first hand, and then an apartment? or lock down a place first? Ive never done nor considered a hard core change like this, but honestly, life is too short, and I'm really over being here. I know I can find work pretty much anywhere, and should at least secure a job before locking down everywhere else so that I can have gas and food money. And Im looking into that, but any other advice would be appreciated."
9228,Moving out of my Toxic Household,"Im 22, in college with a summer job. I just moved out about over a week ago. My mom would kick me out every week and we had a big discussion. She doesn't care about what's happening in the world right now. She says that these protests are all dumb. She says that all those people should just get cover and die because they aren't in quarantine. She just doesn't see the point of the protests. I've tried educating her and explain things but she would just say that I'm stupid and I should shut up. I felt my blood boil. We've had arguments. I got tired of it and decided to check out a room in  house where my friend rents. I came home and I was on the phone with my dad, explaining what I wanted to do. She asked me what's up and I told her, I went to go look for a room to rent. She told me Okay good, move out today. So I called the house owner sidling if I could just move in same day. Originally I was going to move out two weeks later. I was going to explain it calmly to my mom and ask her to maybe work on our relationship with distance. I wanted to move out properly but I was upset and I grabbed all my stuff and left.The house owner hesitated a little because it was so sudden but allowed me to move in.  My grandma and aunt kept calling me, asking to move in with them but they have a toxic house hold and I didn't want to depend on them. My uncle texted me saying he was looking for me that night and said that if something happened to him it was my fault because he's out here searching for me. I told my grandma and she just says ""I know, he was here, he just wanted you to worry so you'd come."" She doesn't understand that its manipulation. Last night, I had a dream he saw me and he kept following me. Anyways, two days after moving out, my mother called me asking me to come home. She said that she would give me my time and space, but at home. She told me she loves me, which she never says. She said that if I don't come home, she doesn't want to be in my life and I could forget she exists. I decided to go talk to her in person and she cried, hugged me... and I cried and asked her to please work with me. To please understand me. At this point, I didn't want to come home, I was hurt but I wanted to try to be independent and I know things aren't going to change with my mom. She says she will but every time I asked her to be a bit communicative and caring towards my siblings and I, she said she wasn't going to change. I kissed her forehead and left crying. I was so sad. I had many moments where I just wanted to go home. I was about to. I felt like shit making my mom cry. I thought, maybe she's right, I should be home. My grandma, her mom, would ask me ""aren't you thinking of the kids?"" I have two young siblings under the age of 13 and an 19 year old brother. I went to the local community college and transferred to the closest university a year ago. I have always been home, caring for my siblings, I told my mom I would continue to be attentive of her and the kids, that I was always a call away, but she rejected me. Now, I'm working, learning how to cook, grocery shopping for myself since I get food stamps because I'm in college. I apply to jobs often so I can support myself after the summer. I have a school tutoring job but because of COVID I may be laid off in the fall and they don't employ me in the summer. When I get home I don't know what to do aside from my household duties, I never really had hobbies, I just watch tv. I feel alone. Not lonely, just alone. I keep to myself. the owner and my friend are nurses so they're never home of they sleep all day. My 19 year old brother dormed at the university I go to for his first year, he tells me I should take this time and focus on me. I need to find a way to improve my self. I try to work out but I feel like my life is kind of pointless right now, I miss my siblings. I used to clean the house and care for them, make sure my dogs were cared for, I did everything because my mom worked evenings. Now, being on my own, I feel empty."
9283,I'm an adult yet I don't adult,Yeah idk what to do. I'm going to be trapped until who knows when. I want to adult but idk what to do... where to go? How to leave? I just don't know. I'm still dependent on my mom and I hate it. I'm becoming sick of it and I want out. Everyone my age seems to be doing better than I am. Though I'm still stuck in 2016 clueless on where to start and what to do to better myself and move out. I need help. I want to become independent but of course there's financial and anxiety problems for me. Life sucks.
9309,Laptop Screen Flickering,My laptop screen keeps flickering and I don't know why.  I don't have any viruses and I already checked that its not related to what position the screen is in or it moving at all.  It just randomly for less than a second flickers off.  What do I do? IDK if I can afford to get it repaired if something is broken and I dont want to pay for repairs if nothing is wrong.
9349,"How can I ""break up"" with my therapist?","I've been seeing a therapist for about 8 months now after a really bad breakdown in winter 2019. He was great at helping me through my here-and-now issues, but now that I'm out of that hole, I want to focus more on other issues that he seems to not be comfortable/skilled in talking about. Plus, his office is in the city where my university was, an hour away, and I've just accepted a full-time job and will be moving even further away at the end of the month.

Is there a healthy way to ""break up"" with my therapist? Is there an accepted normal for how to go about it? I plan to research my options in the city I'm moving to as soon as I'm out of boxes, but I figure that it would be honest to talk to him about it during a session-- I just don't know how.

Thanks in advance!"
9385,Need apartment help/advice! (re-post for visibility since it was stuck in mod queue a couple days),"What price should I look for for rent in an apartment (upstate NY)? How do I judge the quality of an apartment? How long should I sign a lease for, and if I break the lease do I lose my security deposit? I don't know anything about this kind of stuff. I've been coddled my whole life, but after my mental illness being abused and taken advantage of, I need to escape! Is there any resources I can use as well? I made an account on apartmentlist, but even there I don't know what I'm looking for. I don't have a job yet, but I have money in the bank so job recommendations/advice is also welcome! (I've only ever had an under-the-table job before)."
