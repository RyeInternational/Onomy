78,How can I go to the dentist/doctor/whatever if I have to work a full time job?,I'm applying for a bunch of full time jobs currently.  I have braces so once a month or so I have to go do a dentist.  I also have a chronic issue that requires me to go to my doctor once a week for the foreseeable future.  Evidently this doesn't make a good impression to an employer.  So how am I supposed to work a full time job and go to these appointments as well?  
324,Part time/full time job while going to college?,I am currently working as a residential counselor (glorified babysitter for delinquent teens). The job is stressful and makes little money. You can get as much overtime as you would like and is how you make a decent wage. I've typically put in 65-80 hours a week. With going back to school this won't be possible. What would be a good job for and adult while in college? I already have a BA in psychology and am going back to school for IT.
370,Budgeting and being responsible with money?,"So I'm 19 and as much as I don't want to I know I have to start being mature with my money. I'm going to try not to get into the backstory of why I am the way I am, but basically I feel like I had to skip the whole normal teenage years where you work and can spend all your money on normal stuff that you want and not have to worry. So, I think it's hard for me to spend and save wisely because I'm in a position where I feel I can live that way now. Does that make sense? 

I'm 19, still living at home, but work full time. I know that I should move out, but because of what my parents (mostly my dad) did to me growing up I want to milk living here for free as long as possible no matter how toxic the environment. But again, I know I should move out.

 I also realized I should probably figure out what to do about my truck: pay to have it serviced or replace it. Long story short: dad bought the truck 6+ years ago and my older brother used it for a while. Not sure if he did regular maintenance or not. Then it was passed down to me. For the three years I've had it I dont think my dad ever had work done to it. No oil change, nothing. I rarely drove it up until recently because I was doing online school so had no need to leave the house. Then I moved to Seattle for a bit and didn't bring it, but how I drive it every day to and from work. So I'm scared to get it serviced because I know theres probably a shit ton wrong with it and, going back to that ""just wanna spend my money and have fun mentality', I dont want to put money into it. It's a 2004 Toyota Tacoma prerunner with 227,000 miles... feels like it runs great! Hasn't broken down on me ever, but I'm scared that day is fast approaching. So I'm considering trying to buy a used Tacoma with 4wd because it snows here and my little truck now cant handle it. But again, that's a lot of money. 

I want to have fun. For so long I've been burdened by poor mental illness. Secluded from the world, by my own doing, just so I could survive. Dealt with abuse both from others and my own brain. Now, while not free from any of it, I have to have the responsibility of a full time job which makes my mental health worse. My only real escape right now is the expensive hobby of scuba diving. I Was planning on buying my own gear here in a couple days because I'm getting a good bonus on Friday, but now I'm torn between being responsible or treating myself real quick so I can make these next couple months somewhat bearable. 

Savings wise I only have roughly $4k. I have opportunities to make rather large bonuses every month if I work my ass off and am one of the best in the company though. Last month i did just that so I'm getting a bonus this Friday. I dont know how much yet, but some estimate around $2500. It could be more during other months depending on how well we associates do on our goals. Around Christmas time we have what's called super stretch and people have walked  out with $30k bonuses... so theres opportunities to make quite a bit. But I cant operate at full power when every day makes me revert back more and more to suicidal thoughts. With no escape and no motivation it's hard to be your best. Hence my desire to spend money in the pursuit of happiness. 


I need help. 

Sorry for any formatting/spelling errors. My phone likes to correct actual words into nonsense. "
389,Car insurance,"So I need help with car insurance. I (21f) decided to wait until I graduated college to get my license, caus ei lived on campus, and worked in walking distance to campus. 

I just passed my driver's test three days ago (yay me) but now due to my loans, I have terrible credit. I live with my sister, who is on her own insurance. (I'm not her 'married family' so I can't be on her insurance). I work a full time job, but my rent and bills take basically all my money to where I have nothing to save for a car or insurance. 

Long story short, please help me with car insurance advice. "
691,Still failing to set boundaries with my parents. Does this get any better?,"I posted a couple of months ago that I was still struggling with my mom being overly concerned with my life, even though I was moved out. I did OK on some extents, like ignoring her if she complained about self-imposed stress such as how much she “had” to do for Christmas. We have one big point of contention that’s causing fights: me continuing to dog sit for her and my stepdad while they travel. 

I tried to say before I moved that I only wanted to dog sit on weekends from now on, when I didn’t have work at my full time job. The job was 40-50 minutes away when I lived at home, but moving still made the commute half an hour. She does not want that. She doesn’t feel comfortable boarding the dogs because she says they will be attacked or get fleas or another illness. She feels another dog sitter will rob the house. So she trusts nobody but me which is problem number one. She has said she will pay me $200 or $250 for the week which I think is great, but the reason she wants me to keep dog sitting is part because she doesn’t want to give up her travel and also because she did a lot for me when I moved, so I need to show gratitude or pay back her and my stepdad. If I don’t give her an answer that is essentially how happy I am to watch the dogs, she gets furious. My main reasoning is that I don’t want to spend a week away from my bed and kitchen and more convenient work schedule, whereas she thinks a week is no big deal especially since she is paying me.  The ONLY compromise she gave for her March cruise is that I told her I will not cancel a weekend trip I planned before she gets back. I am going on that trip no matter what, unless the organizing company cancels it. But for March I am probably stuck because the cruise is paid for and canceling now would cause her to lose close to $3,000. 

My mom and stepdad have another cruise planned in October and one for January 2021 that are not fully paid for right now. I’m hoping one day she wakes up and realizes that I am out of her house and she can’t own me with the dogs anymore. But she has refused to even consider how I feel at this point. I don’t see any of my friends being asked to stay at their parents’ houses so their parents can travel. My friends get to enjoy their own nice vacations and own homes or apartments. It seems like every other adult has boundaries with their parents and their parents respect those boundaries. Why does this seem to only be happening to me?"
803,I wanna move out and I barely have any money right now. Is my plan to move out in the next 1-2 years stupid?,"It seems epic to just be able to just walk around in your underwear and put on music in the middle of the night. I am 17 years old, and I live in one of the most expensive cities in the world, so I’d have to move to the crappy drug addict area to be able to afford to pay rent in a crappy basement suite. But it just seems amazing to not have your parents asking you questions all the time. I love them and all but living on my own seems amazing and it’s all I think about. I already have $1000 that I got from a summer job last year, and I plan to, if I can, get a part time job while finishing my last year of high school, earning $14 an hour. Then after I graduate, I’d be able to afford to move out with rent costing around $1600. I’d get a full time job, and if it’s minimum wage, I’d expect to get around $2240 a month. So that would leave me with $640 left. Of course I can’t know the exact amount of money I’ll have, or if I’ll even be able to find jobs, but if I do try to do this would it be stupid?"
843,What do I do with my money?,"So, I’ve been in school for as long as I can remember. I finally was able to land a full time job making good pay. All my life I have lived paycheck to paycheck (everything going to rent). Whatever little was left over I blew on clothes or makeup. Now that I have a steady income, what do I do with my money? I’m the kind of person that WILL spend it if I have it. I eventually want a house and love to travel. Ideas?"
1052,Eight weeks into first salaried job - I want to quit!,"This ended up being more of a rant, but here goes nothing...

I'm a 23 year old female who graduated from undergrad a few months ago. I have $25,000 in savings and $18,000 in federal student loans. Eight weeks ago, I began my first ~real salaried position, making $45,000 before taxes. I also have a side hustle where I make anywhere between $500 and $3000 dollars monthly. 

When I first began my full time job, I had high hopes. However, it seems to me that the position mostly involves doing secretarial work, and offers no possibility of teaching me 'hard' skills that can be utilized in another role. I try to have a good attitude, but I feel stressed out and bored at the same time while I'm there, and currently have no idea how well I'm doing because (despite my requests for a meeting) my manager has not provided me with any feedback regarding my work. There is high turnover, and my position is notorious for poor possibility of growth within the firm. 

The position requires about 50-60 hours of work per week, on a ""Chinese overtime"" schedule - meaning that for every hour over 40 that I work, I make half of my regular hourly rate. So, $45000/2080 = $21.63 comes to $21.63/2 = $10.80. If I work the required 50 hours a week, I make $106 before tax, on top of my weekly pay. 

I am incredibly thankful to be getting a regular paycheck, but my schedule provides me with little ability to apply to jobs or develop skills/connections. I am living at home while working at the job, and feel like I've gotten worked into a stagnant pattern in the past two months, and that I need to make a radical change in my surroundings in order to actually gain momentum in a job search. However, I am also terrified of the possibility that I may not get a job for months and months, and that this decision will end in financial ruin. 

Part of me feels like a spoiled baby for even disliking the job (after all, it's a regular paycheck, and the most financially sustainable option by far would be to stay working). However, the other half of me is hyper aware of the options and opportunities that I am letting pass by while I am working 60 hours in menial labor. 

Am I a brat? Is this simply the result of a quarter-life crisis? More importantly - can I even afford to quit my job? "
1071,Apartment Victory,"At 24, I have a high paying full time job as a Sleep Tech, I haven’t even been moved out of my parent’s house for a year yet and I am almost done paying off my first car but I’ve been living in a rough apartment with my boyfriend. The place has definitely seen much better times. It’s 1 bedroom. The issue here is, he has two kids and we have no place for a 5 and 6 year old, our rescue dog, our fat cat and us here. So we put all our eggs into one basket applying for a 3 bedroom right next to my work. Well, WE GOT IT!!!! November 9th we will be victoriously moving in to something I’m proud to live in, decorate, call our own. "
1183,Tips for starting a full time job after college?!,"Sleep schedules, adjusting, everything is changing! What can I do to prepare?"
1202,Moving back in with parents,"So long story short I moved out of my parents when I turned 19 and got a full time job. It was great for a little while and then I felt myself slipping into this really dark place in my life. I started drinking a lot (I know I’m 19 I should be drinking) but it felt excessive. And then I started smoking pot, a lot. Every day I would get high, even before going to work just so I could be a little happier I guess. I started cutting people off cause I was ashamed of what I’d become. A gained a little weight and though it wasn’t much it really bothered me. Anyway, I decided to move back in with my parents only a year later, but as much as I feel a tiny bit better I can’t help feel pathetic. Kind of like I’ve failed at real life and that I’ll just end up in this pathetic circle the rest of my life. Anyone know the feeling or this just really fucking pathetic? I’m really trying to be an adult but damn it’s not easy. "
1228,Salary Help. (Alongside moving out),"I am moving into an apartment with a friend roomie by the end of the year. Rent is going to be about 750/m and we are splitting it. We're not sure if utilities are going to be something we have to pay for yet. But we know we're gonna have to pay at least for rent/food/internet/gas. I want to do some online education, and thought about finding a part time job instead of going with the full time job to have some extra free time. What I can't find out (no matter how long I look into it), is if a part time salary is viable to split rent and the other expenses.

Like I have been trying to do some research on average monthly fees for everything I need to take into account, but literally can't even guess a solid figure to bass it on. With a part-time job, I've been guessing I'd make minimum wage (7.25/h) for 25 hours a week. That and the average rent around here are the only solid figures I know. So i am asking y'all on here if you have a better image of what some of these costs might be, and if a minimum wage part-time job salary could support them all.

Sorry for the dumb questions. ~SP"
1345,(24f) Introvert juggling both full time work and relationship?,"Hey all, haapppy Sunday! I'll try to keep this short and sweet. 

I recently got a full time job in childcare that I'm enjoying. I've been in this field before, my last job was scheduled either part time or full days with hour lunches that allowed for a little down time. 

With my recent job I work with a difficult class but I'm able to keep my energy until I get home and decompress. My boyfriend and I don't live together but we often talk when we both get out of work. I have four hours from when I get home and go to bed and like my relaxation. One thing I love about my boyfriend, is that he and I can be introverts together and not drain each other. However, I've found that at the end of many days though I just need time to myself.

It's mostly all fine and good, and he's an independent guy, but he's been feeling a little swept under the carpet lately (not so good) . I haven't really been chatting with him during my half hour lunches because I'm making friends with other staff, and when I get home, like I mentioned, I just need ""me"" time. I don't want to give him my emotional ""scraps"" at the end of the day though. 

He mostly gets it, but as I'm adjusting how do I juggle both a full time job and relationship well?  

I hope this was an appropriate sub to post this to :) Thanks again"

1387,Does anyone else constantly feel like you’re spending more than you have?,"I have a fair amount saved up - definitely 3ish months worth in savings plus a month in checking. I have... not a full time job, but it’s consistent enough to get by (I’m a substitute teacher). I get paid weekly. 

Even when I worked full time/salaried though, I always feel like I’m spending money I don’t have when I buy bigger things. Even though I have the money, it’s within my income... When i buy anything other than food or coffee, i feel like I’m spending more than I should. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Am I just not budgeting well? I’m not living luxuriously by any means, but I’m always a little anxious about finances and making a set budget makes it worse. "
1604,How do part time jobs work with vacations? Leaving part time jobs prematurely?,"So Ive been working a full time job for 4 years and would get a week of vacation time per year. I recently decided to downgrade to a part time job so I can go back to school full time (and ace all my classes). I will be working as a CNA at a nursing facility. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is, I want to travel on thanksgiving break, winter break, and summer time. I know it will be unpaid with part time work. The last time I worked part time in retail- I didnt get vacations and would just request time off and leave.

&amp;#x200B;

**My questions are:**

**Do I just ask for time off whenever I want? (I want to travel for 1-1.5 weeks at a time)**

**If I want to go out of the country for the summer- do I just put in my 2 weeks notice and leave?? Is this appropriate or will I have a hard time finding another job when I return because of leaving my job?**

&amp;#x200B;

My end goal is to gain patient experience before applying for PA school in 2 years and I dont want to be a CNA forever. This is merely a stepping stone."
1688,How to cope with Adulting?,"For the last couple of years, I [27F] have been feeling like I don’t want to get older. I don’t want any of the responsibility. I don’t want a house, a job, kids, debt, any of it. I *am* getting old. I feel like I’m wasting my life and time is just washing away. Every day, I look older in the mirror. I look back on my life, I’ve done the same as everyone else. I got a degree, got a full time job. I’m independent. I have a boyfriend, and two dogs. But I always think in the back of my mind, is this all there is to life? Working and looking for ways to unwind and enjoy yourself without a real purpose, just existing??? 

I’m not sure I’m portraying my feelings of dissatisfaction correctly. Also, english isn’t my first language. Why do people love life so much if it’s so dull and pointless? Haha, I’m really trying. I’m so frustrated. Is this it? Is this all there is to life as an adult? I feel like now that college is over and I’ve been 3 years at my current job and make fair money, which is what society tells you you should do, what’s the big deal?! 

How do I cope with this? 
What do you focus on to feel satisfied with yourself and your life?
What makes this life enough for you?"
1817,"Just married, banking help? (trying to adult)","Sorry if this isn’t the right sub!!! If it isn’t, please point me in the right direction. 

My husband and I are planning to merge our bank accounts into a joint bank account. We are trying to find a new bank because the ones we currently use are in our respective hometowns (which we no longer live in). We are completely clueless about what to look for in a bank, account types, credit cards,  (if we should even get one?) interest, (???)

1887,I need medication to feel okay.,"I'm 25.  Newly out on my own.  First year in my full time job.  First relationship going extremely well, he moved in with me.

I've had so much more ""adulting"" this year than I expected.  I think I'm rocking it, however I have felt totally overwhelmed.  I feel like I'm carrying something very heavy, and I'm exhausted.  I'm told I sleep walk and talk almost every night, getting no quality sleep.  My diet has been thrown off, and I haven't been exercising because I'm exhausted.  My work is suffering.

I was first put on antidepressants at age 12.  I remember not knowing what depression was, I just described it as not being able to feel feelings anymore.  Since then I was on antidepressants on and off.  Mostly on.

Two years ago I got off all medications (they had me on three and I felt like shit).  I was able to handle my shot and I felt amazing for a long time.  The meds changed my personality.  I liked the idea that I was my ""organic"" self.

As I said above, I've been having a hard time lately.  I decided to get back on my old med that worked best for me, Wellbutrin 300mg.  I'm on day 5.  I feel amazing.  I feel I could get on my table and dance.  I've caught up on all emails I had neglected for work.  Cleaned the apartment.  It feels like I'm a lamp that someone just plugged into the wall.

I feel like a bit of a failure.  I feel like I'm weak and can't handle life organically.  I'm disappointed.  I feel like I can't handle life and that's pathetic for an adult.

How should I feel about this?"
1977,Temporary living,"Hey guys, my friend and I are trying to find a temporary 2 month place to live for the summer (Mid may to end of July). He needs to move here for a job he has, and I'm trying to move out of my family's house, because covid  rushed me back, and I don't have any space, and I am taking online courses the first half of summer and have a full time job the second half, working remotely (so some space to work is needed). We both have places to live starting in August, but we need something for the summer. Ideas on where we might be able to look for temporary housing on a short notice? AirBNB seemed kinda pricey, and right now we are looking at extended stay hotels."
1990,How the hell do people do it?,"Listen man. I’m sick of living at home. Turning 25 soon and I have this inkling telling me that if I stay living with my parents any longer I’ll be stuck.

I have a full time job, doesn’t make as much as I hoped for (38K), and student loans. A lot of my pals tell me to just move out if it’s costing my sanity, but it’s making me insane thinking about a shithole I’ll be in. 

My only realistic way of getting out of this place is if I get a job out of state and have to move out, but we all know the the job market is a battlefield.


What do you think? Have you moved out without having 10K in your savings accounts?"
2012,Any movie theater employees here?,"Hey, I received the link from my movie theater employer to apply to receive a Will Rogers grant.

We don’t have to bring in a ton of money, only about $200 or so per week.

2296,References for buying a house,"Hello!

For background, I am 23, and looking to buy a house some time after I graduate and start a full time job in January. I have no clue where to begin; I've read that 20% would be enough for a down payment on a house, but I've heard from older friends that they've put down 5% and been fine, since in their opinion, 20% is a little bit less realistic. 

I *could* save for 20% on a house, but it would take about 10-11 months, to over a year, with maximum saving towards the house. But aside from this, what are some specifics? Do I really need a realtor? I've had a credit card for about a year and a half, and have maintained good credit; will this help, especially given that I'll be able to buy the house basically in another year?

I appreciate any advice, links, or references to any resources that can help! Thank you in advance :)"
2462,How to get over severe money anxiety?,"I inherited a lot of anxiety about spending from my mom. She grew up poor in a rural area, so even though our family was always middle to upper middle class thanks to my dad’s job, she always complained about the price of anything my brother or I needed. It made me really scared to ask for anything, and I get stressed out whenever anybody spends money on me.  

I always had odd jobs that only lasted a summer or a few months throughout high school and college. My mindset has always been to save as much as possible, since I didn’t know when I’d be working next. Now I have a full time job that pays me enough to save a lot and splurge a little, with significant student loan payments each month however. I feel paralyzed spending money on myself or to socialize with new friends. Even if I know I’m doing fine budget-wise, something inside me panics with each purchase that maybe I’ll need that money later, or if I spend $20 on something I’ll spend hours thinking about what else I could have bought for $20. I also find myself getting really upset when someone spends money on me. I know some people like treating others, and I ruin it by begging them to just let me pay for my own because I know I won’t reciprocate later. I just want to have a clear head and not hate myself every time I spend a dollar. "
2470,Starting to get tired and impatient while chipping away at the adulting block...,"I’m 27. I finally feel like an adult. I take care of my shit. I have a good full time job and a car. I pay all my bills on time. I have good health insurance. I brush and floss twice sometimes three times a day. I finally have a good relationship with my family. I don’t hide from old acquaintances when I see them on the street. I know what I want in romance and friendship. I figured out what boundaries are! I can drink alcohol without embarrassing myself. I even have a solid skincare routine and gym membership which I use. 

Now the only thing holding me back is $40k of debt. I just moved out of my lovely expensive adult home and into my relative’s living room so I can live as cheaply as possible and pay off this fucking debt ASAP. I’m sick of it. I didn’t work my ass off through college till now just to be held back forever by student loans. I’m not leaving this twin size day bed until my till debt is GONE. I figure it will take me a year if I live frugally and get my side hustle on.

But I just have to say, I’m so tired. I just want to be there already. I’m at the bottom of the ladder in so many ways. Just starting to pay off debt. Just starting to see someone new (who is also living with relatives to save money). Just starting to put my degree to use and work in the field of my passion. 

I have so much to learn and do and adapt to. I don’t even know where to put my underwear at the moment. I am just baaaarely getting the hang of being a professional in my field. I don’t know where I want to live or what I want to do after this debt is payed. Still unsure if this person I’m seeing is the greatest or a secret psychopath.  It’s a lot to handle. I feel positive, but I want to fast forward to 6 months from now.  Please. Ugh.

2571,Dealing with change,"God there is loads of change at work. For some background I’m a teaching assistant and a MDSA at a special needs school. We are mergering to try to cut costs. So as part of my MDSA work I do a fair amount of supply work (around 6 hrs a week). They are currently saying that they will be looking to hire someone to cover supply as a full time job. 

Secondly it is looking increasingly likely that they will be putting into place an extended day programme. So after work I work in a after school club for three hrs. No one seems to know what will happen to this. Rumours are saying it’s likely that will run multiple different clubs. 

Thirdly I am covering for two days a week in our secondary class which I am loving. We don’t know when the lady is back (she’s due in a few days)

So it’s likely I would lose about 900 pounds (ouch). How does everyone deal with this kinda of uncertainty "
3071,My mom is going to beg me for money again.,"Since my parents’ divorce when I was 14, my mom has relied on my sister and I for money.  Now that my sister works and lives on her own (very low income), my mom doesn’t bother her for money because she can’t spare much.  Once or twice a year she comes to me.  

At the moment, my mom (59) tells me she has -1200 USD in her checking account, because she didn’t have enough for her automatic house payment, and close to half of the 2300 she brings home per month goes to paying off payday loans.  Her electricity was supposed to be turned off last week, but it was extended to the 23rd - she can’t pay it.  She was supposed to use her car as collateral on a $700 payday loan to get her through, but I had to drive her from work yesterday because her cat broke down.

This has been over half my life.  She has such problems.  She can’t manage her money, and her boyfriend (45) of 3 years is unemployed and sits around in her house all day, she doesn’t make him work or anything.  It’s insane. 

I’m 25, in grad school, in a really nice full time job with great benefits.  I am financially healthy for the first time in my adult life.  My student loan refund comes through next week, and my mom knows it.  I have told her for months now that I need every dollar and cannot give her any.  She already asked me last week - I was open that the answer would be no.  She acted offended that I “didn’t even want to talk about it.”  I said she could say what she had to say but the answer would be no.

I’ll keep saying no.

I have been saving money and slowly furnishing my new apartment.  It’s been so great living on my own, away from my family with their problems.  My mom will not fuck this up for me, I’ve worked to hard.

She will ask again, it’s coming.  I have had trouble with her before trying to apply for credit cards with my SSN and info, I have to be on the watch for things like that as well (I’ve told her, next time I’ll pursue legal action and I don’t care that she’s my mom).

I already feel pressure.  I’m talking to her and going home as little as possible.  

Do any of you who have dealt with this kind of thing have any advice?"
3163,Learning to drive,"Hi I'm 19 years old and I never learned to drive 😪 I have severe driving anxiety and I've only been behind the wheel twice in my life. I have an ultimatum that I need to learn to drive by October or I'll be in big trouble, my dad is willing to teach me but I'm always making excuses because I'm afraid.

What are some tips for beginners to help ease my anxiety or just make it easier in general? It really sucks having to rely on my parents to get to my full time job as well and I'm so ready to be independent.

Thanks in advance 😁"

how do i manage working a full time job (overnight), keeping in touch with family members and sustaining an exceptional social life...i know it sounds dumb but i seriously need help and advice on how to deal with it all. i have really bad anxiety and i suffer from Aspergers (an extremely mild form of autism) so it’s already hard enough for me to have the courage and energy to be social. for most of my day i’m usually sleeping to prepare to work all night, i see missed calls from my family all the time but i usually end up forgetting to call back or getting scared and worried and all wound up to the point that i don’t even have the energy or motivation to unlock my phone. i swear i have the mind of a 15 year old. this adult thing just isn’t clicking in my head."
3435,How to combat the repetitive workweek grind,"I’m new to the adult world after graduating from college. I have a full time job where (including commuting) I am gone from 7 am - 5:30 pm every day (typical). I read fun books on my commute and during lunch so I already get a good dose of that. When I get home, I make dinner and do a few things around my apartment. I then play video games or watch TV for about an hour and a half until I head to bed. And I do that every day again. And again. And again. Until Friday night. Then I have a fun weekend, then back to work.  Alas this is the rest of my life, and is the life of every single adult so I know it’s not unusual. 

My question is, when this starts getting really discouraging and “existential crisis” levels, what do you do to get excited again? Very low budget because I’m living paycheck to paycheck. 

Thanks!"

3741,How do you manage having hobbies and relationships as an adult working full time?,"I want to start by mentioning that I have a medical condition that requires I stick to a regular sleep schedule. My doctor recommends at least 10 hours but obviously that’s f***ing unreasonable and I’ve been doing fine with 8-9 hours for the past 4 years so I generally go to bed at 8pm and wake up at 5am on weekdays.

Now that that’s out of the way...

I work full time, 8 hours a day 40 hours a week.

I typically get home from work at 3:30-4pm

My usual routine is to do the dishes, care for my plants, get 30 minutes of regular cleaning in, 30 minutes of exercise, shower, make dinner and IF I still have time I’ll tackle a bigger task (I’m in the process of decluttering right now) or work on a hobby/project for my Etsy shop...

If I need to schedule appointments or manage bills or whatnot I’ve gotta fit that in too.

I add IF I have time because it’s rare that I have more than an hour to do anything at the end of the night.

I also see my boyfriend a few nights a week or on the weekend.

Between all my “little” but important projects and tasks like decluttering...planning my summer garden...scheduling appointments... paying/managing bills and dealing with all the little things that come up and attempting to make time for my boyfriend I feel like I have no time to do anything I enjoy.

In the past year I’ve finished two projects for my Etsy shop... haven’t managed to declutter my apartment... finished two out of the 5 personal projects I wanted to complete...haven’t picked up a single book or started a drawing or painting...and spent time with my girlfriends a total of 3 times.

My goal was ultimately to keep my art a priority so I could eventually quit my full time job and make my art my full time job. I can’t even find the time to do projects I enjoy let alone projects I can sell!

Anyone have any time saving tips for cooking? Deculttering? Cleaning? Adult things in general? 

I want to make time for the things I enjoy and my friends, but feel like the only way would be to sacrifice time with my boyfriend or my health by sleeping less...

I DO sometimes work on art projects with him around, but it’s just not the same? We mostly watch anime or play video games together.

I have discussed spending less time together during the week but he’s not too keen on that and seemed offended that I’d rather spend time alone than with him because I can do stuff if he’s around, but then I will be ignoring him at my sewing machine while he catches up on the anime I also want to watch lol"

3970,First birthday I'm not looking forward to.,"I (M26) feel like I've finally made it to that point where I understand why adults aren't always excited to have aged another year.  Sometimes it's about getting older.  But a lot of the time I think it's about expectations we have for ourselves.

First, I want to acknowledge that I have had some significant challenges with my mental health the past few years.  I have diagnosed depression, but I got back on my medication last month and I'm now seeing a therapist, so I'm finally taking care of that again.  I know my depression made everything feel a bit worse.

My 26th birthday is next month.  In the past few years, my life has been a bit of a tornado.  I have my first full time job, and I'm nearly done with my master's degree.  I have my first pets (dog and reptile) that I'm 100% responsible for the care of.  I've moved out into my own apartment, and I finally have the damn place the way I like it.  I dated for the first time just over a year ago, am in a relationship for the first time, and he moved in with me about five months ago.  I am 100% financially independent, which is scary as hell.

I didn't think I would ever accomplish the things I have the past few years.  But it's difficult to actually see any of these things as ""accomplishments"".  I was raised to believe that being self sufficient was the goal in life pretty much, and people who rely on others a lot are failures in some way.  Typical White American mindset.  

Thing is, I'm really tired.  Like, exhausted.  (Admitting this is something else I was raised to believe was bad - weakness, even.)  I really just want to get to the part of my life where I can have a good time.  I know that's selfish to say, or lazy or whatever.  But I really want to start enjoying myself.  If I'm not depressed, I have a general feeling of apathy about most things.  I can't enjoy anything, nothing makes me excited.  I am finding it very difficult to muster up the enthusiasm required for school and work.

Turning 26 feels like a big one.  25 did as well.  When I think about what I wanted to accomplish this year - I suppose I did a lot of what I wanted.  I'm just still not happy, and I don't know why.  And I'm not excited to be moving forward when nothing brings me joy.  I don't know how people just get through life with a smile.

I just really wanted to be in a place where I was having a good time by 26.  I feel I've let myself down."
4011,Extreme anxiety about moving out at 22 during a pandemic,"So I’m a 22 year old female and I’m in nursing school. I graduate at the end of December and will hopefully be working as a nurse around January (assuming I pass the nclex). So I have always wanted to move out as I live with a single father and it’s been a rough time. Recently though he has told me that I will not be able to return to school in the fall because of the virus (because a large part of my schooling is clinical in the hospital). 

Sooooo I guess now is the time. I have asked a ton of friends and no one seems to be in the right position to move anytime soon so I went to Facebook. Found a girl that was looking for something in the same area as me and has the same budget and is the same age and also a student. We’ve met and go a apartment hunting a few times. I told my bf about the girl I met and he was completely against living with some stranger I found on Facebook and I understand but I’m kind of in a position that that’s the best I can do here. 

It turns out she is a really cool girl. Like I feel that we would actually be friends had we met in any other setting. But for some reason I am so scared. My bf is right she is just a stranger and who knows what could happen. She doesn’t have a real full time job (but neither do I) but we both have good lump sums of cash and plan on working new jobs. For now she nannies and plans to get a serving job while she’s in dental assistant school. I work as a cna in a hospital but have been unable to work while living with my dad (my boss understands and says I can come back when I am ready). I feel like I can trust her but you never really know. My mom has agreed to be the co-signer. We’ve discussed a lot as to what some rules and needs would be as roommates. But it’s still just scary any way you look at it. But August is coming and I need to move. 

Should I just go for it?

TL;DR parent forcing me out in a few months and I found a roommate in Facebook. It’s scary to love with strangers but, should I just go for it?"
4212,How do you guys get through when you hate your job?,"I'm 26M, in my first full time job for about four years now.

I've decided it's not for me.  There are two big reasons.

(1) the clients I work with are dumb as hell and I do so much more handholding than I thought I'd do.  No one wants to do anything on their own, it's infuriating.

(2) I don't care for the others in my office much.  They started out nice, but there are issues.  Most people are 40's and 50's, so we don't relate much on that level (people have made comments about my age all the damn time, even though I have the most formal education in the office).  The office is also very clique-ey, and once I fell out of favor with the popular group, things became bad.  They make up things about me and the boss yells at me.  I'll explain why I'm in the right and he'll apologize, but it's still very frustrating.

I am burnt out at this job.  I do my best, but I'm sure my lack of energy shows in terms of my enthusiasm for my role.  We write our own reviews and I always get a raise, but still.

I'm joining the military in 7 months, and I'm beyond excited.  I needed a huge career and lifestyle change, and this is it.  I know there will be challenges, but I can't wait for a new chapter.

I'm just not sure how to make it through these last months at my current job.  I am trying not to have anxiety the night before work and that seems to be going okay.  We're back in the office now (3 days a week) and going in still fills me with dread.  I don't even log into our chat system because it makes me so anxious.  

Can I have some tips on getting through?

Fucking hate my job.  Having another option empowered me to see the light at the end, but it also made me realize I'm more unhappy than I realized."
4322,I want to save up 10k before I get my first apartment (splitting rent with roommate) should it be more? Could I get away with less?,"Some background info, I am 23 years old and just got my first real full time job 3 months ago. Before this I worked part time and didnt make very much money so I am just now starting to build up my savings. Right now I have $4000 saved. While living with my parents can be annoying and not ideal I do not have a problem with staying with them for as long as its needed to save up money. I mainly want to move out so I can get a place with my boyfriend, we have been together since 14 and went through periods of long distance so its really about time. I plan on taking a whole year for saving up and want to have $10k saved before I make the move. I plan on getting a place where my half of rent would be around $500. Is this a sufficient amount of money to have saved up or should it be more? Or would I be able to do it with even less? "

And then it occurred to me that once I get done and get a job, I will be (probably) working eight hours a day five days a week for the next forty years. I likely sound spoiled, but I’m only 22 and the only full time job I’ve had was only for the summer.

4390,Is a $200 a month apartment a good deal?,I am an 20 year old interested in moving out. I work one part-time job (trying to find a full time job) and have my eyes set on this studio [apartment in Phoenix](https://www.apartments.com/phoenix-west-phoenix-az/9ypn7f7/) that cost $209-224 a month. It sounds like a deal too good to be true since most apartments I've seen rent at least $500 a month. Check it out and tell me anything you know about moving out. 
4478,Need a full time job. I am pretty lost on how to do so at this point.,"I (26F) feel absolutely ashamed that I’m still living at home with my parents. Long story short, I had Heath issues that seeped into my early 20’s which interfered heavily with my studies. I took longer than most to finish college and finally graduated this may with my undergraduate degree in justice studies. 

I graduated in the middle of the covid shut down and scrambled to find employment, and landed a part time job. The job that I landed was originally full-time, but given the coronavirus pandemic the employer informed me that it would be part time for the time being. I was applying for a lot of different jobs and wasn’t landing on any of them so I took the part-time job so that I could at least save some money. From the looks of it, even though my job is technically part time I still don’t have any clients, and the clients that I’ve had or not reliable. So really I don’t have hours. 

When I graduated with my undergraduate degree my silly brain was under the impression that I could just find a job. Come to find out that you need all kinds of different certifications and licenses on top of it. I don’t mind going in pursuing a certification or a license, I’m just completely out of ideas on what to do for work. 

I’ve applied to at least 50 different jobs with the VA, and no department seems to be interested in my resume. My current position is working within the ABA field, but the hours are so unreliable I might as well not even have a job. at this point I’m ready to work in retail again, which I don’t want to do but will if it means I can have health insurance, because at this point I cannot afford to die because I am without health insurance. I don’t want to come off as the asshole who blames California prices, but goddamnit it’s expensive to live here. Even moving the hell out of here costs money. 

Any ideas for employment would be amazing. I have an associates degree in communications, a bachelors degree in justice studies, about 2-3 years of customer service experience, a couple of internships under my belt, and about three months experience working with children with autism. (I just got this job three months ago)"

4593,"Planning to leave my full time job after 3.5yrs for another. First job post-school, and so first time doing this. I'm nervous.. what do I need to know about leaving?","Hi! 25/F.

I started working my current position 3.5 years ago as an intern while I was in school. It kept going, stopped being an internship, and turned into my first full-time job.

I'm ready to leave. The commute stinks and I've had a switch in bosses to someone who has even admitted that she is not ""cut out to be a manager."" She's nice, but I can't say I totally disagree.

I have been looking at openings in a very non-serious way for months, if not longer just so that I have an eye on what kind of options I might have. My hesitation has been (1) the fact that my resume needs work, (2) the fact that I feel like I'm always in the middle of something at work and (3) probably just some normal levels of nervousness, I guess.

Last month I saw a position that sounded really exciting, and the thought of it kicked me into gear. The thought of applying to it then-and-there made me feel like my resume needed to be worked on ASAP. My resume was not something that I would have been proud enough to send off for a job that I wanted. I made an appointment with my alma mater's career center and they were a huge help in going through what would make my resume stronger. Basically, I have to recreate it. But it's okay! *When I see a job I want, I want to give them the resume that suits.*

So, I'm working on fixing my resume now. When that's ready, I guess I'll get to the ever-important step of applying to things! But my big concern is that there are protocols I should follow at work through this process and up until my last day, when that day comes. I haven't told a soul at work. There are like two people I *would* tell, but I really don't want to create and chatter or concern until I'm ready to give them some notice.

So... is there anything I should know about the process of leaving/starting something new? I know I need to get over the whole excuse of ""well, I'm in the middle of something at work right now,"" because I guess that will never *not* be true. 

Thanks so much!"

4721,Only months into 1st job and I think I hate it. What should I do?,"I just got a job end of September at Wegmans working overnights part time as a ""overnight grocery customer service worker""... I stock shelves. I only work part time as this is my 1st real job ever and among other circumstances I just couldn't jump right into a full time job. My plan was to start off where I'm at and then move up to full time and then maybe manager or something of that nature. It's just that I'm realizing that I don't think I want to do this much longer let alone full time I think I'd die of boredom. I went to CC for business administration and entrepreneurship which this has nothing to do with. I literally show up grab a cart of crap and put it on a shelf for 5hrs a night. I started off at about 20hrs a week but now down to a about 15hrs. The schedule is actually really good for the most part it just doesn't help in the pay dept. I knew I wouldn't get much as a part timer but that was OK cuase I have no real expenses but I make like $150 a week compared to the $200-$250 I was at start when I was working 4 nights a week compared to 3. I like most of the ppl I work with and the atmosphere and everything seems nice. I don't get much of the really good benefits since I'm only part time but many would be very helpful to me personally if I lasted long enough to get to full time. I never got a job for the money I wanted to do a job that I enjoy and I feel is important in some way. that is what matters to me most. I'm probably living in some unrealistic fantasy land to think that could actually happen but everyone around me whined and complained while I was growing up and some still do about how much they can't stand their jobs an I don't want that to be me. I know I want to start a small business someday. Nothing fancy just centered around something I like doing. I guess before this rant what I wanted to know is should I wait it out and see if anything changes or get out quick before I lose my mind?"
4746,It’s been a very good year for me. (25M),"Just want to put this out there, in the spirit of Thanksgiving and to recognize my own accomplishments for once.  I strive for improvement tenaciously but I don’t enjoy where I’m at in the moment enough.

This has been a big year in terms of adulting.

1. I got my first full time job within my career field and am doing very well, I’ve already gotten a raise and the boss is very happy with me.  Great benefits and pay, I couldn’t be happier.

2. I moved into my own apartment, out of my moms house, for the first time.  I had to take on a lot of new expenses and it was scary at first, but being totally in charge of my own affairs is very sobering and liberating.  My dog and I are doing great!

3, I took and passed two more courses for my masters degree.  I delayed it, but I proved this year that I’m still going.

4. I lost even more weight and now I’ve reached my goal weight (290lbs-190lbs) and am focusing on building muscle now.  I have been fat since I was 11 and didn’t have much of an adolescence because of it.  I look better than I ever have in my life and at age 25 I have gone from XXXL to Medium shirts, and 46” waist to 34”.  I think I’m damn good looking for the first time ever, and it’s only getting better.

5. I went on my first date and learned a lot about what I’m not looking for in a guy.  Generally made the transition from just thinking about guys to actually flirting and asking them out.  It’s a process I’m still working on, but lots of progress this year.

Things are only getting better.  Still working on my credit score, muscles, there’s a crack in my windshield, etc.

Man, it’s been a very good year.  I was so scared for this chapter in my life, but I’m actually kicking ass!"

Years back, I got a boyfriend and was planning to move out of my parents’ house to be with him. However, we broke up 1.5 years ago and Ive never left my parents’ house.  I want to move out obviously due to my age and the fact that my parents are huge narcissists and don’t deserve the added burden of me being here tho I do pay rent (they charge a reduced rate since they’re wealthy and paid off their mortgage years ago) and all my own bills.

It’s now the dead of winter where I am so I can’t imagine moving now, plus I hate my job and am debating whether to get a different job before moving, but I’m terrified of ending up stuck in analysis paralysis until I’m 40. Any encouragement stories from other severe late bloomers here, or advice?"

but all i can think is like... so what the fuck do i do with all my free time?? 

what do i do every night after i make dinner?? 

i have weekends off, two whole days and i dont have to spend them using all the free time studying or writing essays plus cleaning with no time for myself? 

adulting is weird"
5019,why can't i let go of my childhood?,"i am 25 years old. i still enjoy all of the things that i enjoyed when i was 10. i still live at home and i love my room the way it is: twin bed, plushies, games that i love etc. i finished university, i have a new full time job, and i plan to move out in the near future. i am nostalgic and i love thinking back to my elementary school days and i always think that those were such fun times. i am interested in adulting, however, i am not interested in letting go of my childhood. is this a bad thing?"
5130,Could I get a loan for a house?,"My husband and I have been married for a little over a year now, we are both 20. ( yes I know it’s young) could we get a loan for a house? 
He’s got a credit score over 650, I personally have no credit. we make about 30k a year together. We could make more if I get a better full time job. 
Is it even remotely possible that the bank would give use a loan?"
5225,"How short is considered ""bad"" for working a job?","For context, I have a full time job in fast food as a manager. I've been here for just over 4 years now.
I am planning on going back to school next august, but I am wanting a second job so I can put away a bunch of money so I can cut back on my hours. 

I know that job hopping is bad and that working for a short period of time looks bad on a resume. I just dont know what that cutoff point is between acceptable and bad."
5253,I Got A Full Time Job.,"As the title suggests, I got a full time job! It comes with 50¢ over the minimum waste, with room for raises, and sick pay. I’ve always had a job but this is my firs full time one, making more money than ever. I mainly got it because I wanted to keep my dog. However, I’m super proud of myself."
5257,i got fired...,"(21 f) i finally thought my life was starting to make sense when i got hired three weeks ago at a real estate agency as a receptionist. it was no secret that it was my first real full time job after finishing college and my boss had told me they chose me rather than another woman who was more experienced because they “loved me” during the interviews. (there was a lottttt to learn, i wouldn’t even call it receptionist)

this afternoon i get pulled aside and get basically told that my contract is being terminated effective immediately, and that “i wasn’t the same person than the one in the interviews”, that “i was nonchalant and didn’t seem motivated” when that is the furthest from the truth. i asked what she meant by that and she gave me a pretty bad excuse, so bad i still don’t understand what happened.

i’m in shock. all the jobs i’ve had, my bosses only had good things to say about me, one of them even sent my mother an email on my last day “praising” me when i was a teenager. (not trying to brag) 

i’ve cried my tears but i’m still so confused :(

my older sister told me that when she was younger she went through the exact same thing while working for the same type of company. 

i feel useless and so lost. i’m sorry for venting i just need moral support :("
5295,First full time job - crunched and lonely,"Hey guys. I'm in my first full time job and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't understand how people stay sane, much less happy, working so many hours a week. I feel like I have no time left to do anything by the time I've gotten off work and prepared for the next day. How do you guys manage?

Side note, it's also incredibly lonely. I technically have two coworkers and a boss, but we have opposite shifts since this is a small establishment. How do you guys manage to keep from getting lonely when so much time is spent doing things alone?"
5330,When and why should a person get a credit card?,"I've never had a credit card before. When I pay for stuff I usually pay for stuff with cash, debit card, paypal, gift cards or those prepaid credit cards. And on the rare occasion use my parents credit card for stuff I can't pay any other way then paying them back in cash.  

So now I'm thinking about getting my first credit card, as I'm looking to do more online shopping in the future and I hear credit cards are a more secure payment method for doing that instead of with paypal. Also for more independence from my parents I guess. 

I'm just wondering when you guys think is the best time for someone to get a credit card if they've never owned one before. What kind of card to get and why. What pitfalls to avoid. What to be aware of. I have a full time job, so I don't think being able to pay the bills will be a problem for me. But I've heard cases of people having pretty bad problems with cards, like getting into debt or paying a lot of money for stupid fees, and I want to avoid that."
5347,Living in a house when you're not on the lease?,"My fiancee and I moved from Colorado back to Virginia after I had a stillbirth. I'm still unemployed, and he has job in the Glazers Union with decent credit.

We keep getting straight up ignored from potential rental locations after they know I'm employed and have no credit. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I'm holding him back. Would it be best to have him apply on his own without me? Would he get in trouble if I lived with him and wasn't on the lease? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like we're so limited, it's so hard to get approved with me now being employed, having no credit despite previously having a good job, and he has felonies from 11 years ago (but maintained a good record since then). 

&amp;#x200B;

I just have lost all hope, this year has been awful and we left living with his parents so he could have a better job opportunity and everything fell through with our housing and now we're homeless while he works a full time job, and I am looking for houses day in and day out..

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice helps. At this point I really do think he's better off without me."
5399,To rent or to mortgage?,"I'm a 20F uni student in the UK. Basically, should I rent a place now and move out like I want to, or should I stay with my mum and save like mad for a few years? Sorry this is a bit rambly

For the last few years, I was in a committed relationship with this girl, and basically spent 80% of my time at her parents' house with her, then the rest of the time at my mum's house up the road. There were MANY times my stress and happiness were chaotic because I didn't feel settled, but due to some stuff in the relationship, I didnt feel able to spend more time at my technical ""home"". Now, I'm with a man (21) who lives across town, and again I split my time fairly equally between houses, but more so at his parents'. This worked okay because I was a lot happier and could cope with the daily travelling, it also got me out the house more.

But now there's a good chance I'll be getting a full time job alongside my 2 days at uni which will include extremely long shifts, possibly overnights as well. The whole thing is stressing me out to the max because I feel homeless? Like I'm split between 2 houses constantly, and don't have a real emotional/physical base at either house. There's no chance of me having a real routine, and I feel like an outsider wherever I am. Knowing me, with the stress of spending long amounts of time between 4 places (mum, bf, uni classes, work), I'm terrified that I won't cope with all the moving around if I'm split so cleanly in half between the places I ""live"".

I've looked into renting in my town, and could afford it with a full time job, but it won't leave much room to save for a mortgage. I don't really understand the issue with renting a place I like for a few years while saving more slowly, but my older sisters have made me feel like I'm making terrible, stupid and rash decisions. The other option is putting what I'd spent on rent and bills into savings, and then getting a mortgage in a couple of years. It's a toss-up between my immediate happiness and stress, and furthering my adult life down the road. 

I feel like renting ASAP would give me the base of operations I need to feel settled and ""regrouped"" each day, and it would also mean my boyfriend could focus on HIS mortgage savings if he stayed with me and paid less than he does at his parents' (we're in this together for the long run, and i intended to afford this with or without him). I'm genuinely not sure how well I'll cope with feeling stressed and unhappy with the current arrangement while work is thrown in too. 

(Yes I could easily spend less time at my boyfriend's parents' house, but even when I'm home for the majority of the time, I feel like such an outsider and as if I don't belong simply because it hasn't been my 100% home for my whole young adult life)

(Also yes I will be saving for a mortgage as well as renting, but more slowly than if I wasn't renting) 

Tldr: I have an extremely messed up routine which is about to get even harder with work, is it sensible for my happiness from renting ASAP to outweigh the investment of working towards a mortgage?"
5450,Question relating to medi-cal qualifications.,"I’ve been trying super hard to find a full time job so I can have insurance, another topic for another time but I have an art degree so no luck other than freelance... I had two part times and over all I am having no luck. I am off my moms insurance in about a month, and I recently found out I need a necessary surgery. I don’t think I am able to get said surgery in time due to waiting and what not so I will have to rely on medi-cal until I can find that full time job ...
A worker at kaiser told me medi-cal is based in the income of the individual and some told me it’s based on house hold. Problem is if it’s based on household I am absolutely screwed. I live with my mom, sister, her bf, and grandma and my mom makes a lot of money but does NOT support me financially. I pay my fair share of rent, buy my own food, utilities so yes I live with her, but I am not dependent on her at all once or ever except her insurance I guess? But other than that zero help. But she does make a lot of money and I think if it really is household income I’m screwed. Does anyone how if it’s through self like the guy said or House hold? I really need this surgery..

I’m assuming people with roommates are also a screwed? Because I’m essentially in a room mate situation even though it happens to be with my mom. Does this mean if someone who needs to go on medical can’t qualify if the roommates income counts as well?"
5580,"Lots of PTO, not allowed to use it.","I'm 25 in my first full time job with benefits.  One of these benefits is paid time off - annual leave and sick leave.

At my old job (same profession, but I was part time and expectations were different) the culture was encouraging of taking ""mental health days"" for ""self care"" as often as needed - and man, people did.  I work in higher ed, you see.  At this current job, I get a LOT of PTO, but people never call off.  Scheduling days off in advance is okay, but taking sick days more than once in a great while is very much discouraged.

I feel a bit stuck here.  I'm afraid to take sick days when I need them (I deal with some mental health issues that make my very people-oriented job difficult on bad days).  My boss has not given me any of the supervision or mentorship I thought I'd get in this position - he barely talks to me at all.  Therefor I am unclear what the expectation is.

I'm not sure how to handle this.  I got in some hot water because I woke up Monday morning with a bad migraine that lasted all day, so I had to take a sick day.  My boss said ""okay"", but later I found out he was pissed about it.  He does not address issues or communicate problems, and he dances around confrontation.  This results in a very passive-aggressive supervisor, and I'm learning that is not the style of supervision for me.

I'm not saying I need to take a sick day every couple weeks.  But I don't know what the expectations are, and when I talk to my boss, he acts like a chill party dude until things actually happen.

How should I navigate this?  Talking to him directly is ineffective.  Also feels strange to feel bad about taking sick time when I earn so damn much of it."
5902,Jobs and adulting; a memoir.,"Hello fellow adults.

I have a full time job. Other than working I do nothing. On my days off I sleep in then go and read or walk around wherever. The other side of it is I get paid ok but I wouldn’t be against having more money.

My conundrum is:

A. Do I get a second job to do things on the days off where I do nothing to make more money 

or

B. Look for a new, more fulfilling job and hopefully get lucky."
5926,Planning for a vacation,I have an upcoming trip this December (4th-8th) and I’m seeking advice on how most people start saving for trips. I have a full time job and I usually put 400 away for rent and then 10% of my remaining money in my checkings into my savings. Idk how much to put into my “vacation savings” without being totally broke until the day of my trip. Advice?
5959,"Moving out and keeping a job I dont like, or leaving my job and going to school for 2 to 4 years and staying home with parents?","I'm 24. I feel like if I stay home, I'm going to be a granny by the time i can actually move out. No offense to any 28 year olds living at home still!!! But I'm kind of experiencing fear of missing out. Your 20s are your prime. I can't bring a guy home, I have to be sneaky, My parents (mainly mom) want to know my every move, every guy I talk to, every date I'm going on..etc. dont get me wrong my mom is my best friend and I love to include her, but i made mistakes in the past by telling her everything about my ex which caused issues. I can't have any pets. I really want a dog or cat or bunny. My parents are anti-furry anything lol. I have to clean my room all the time. You know the normal, living w in th ur parents kind of things. I'm grateful to have them and be with them. But this fear of missing out is killing me. Like what if I die b4 I ever get to have a dog?? Or a one night stand??!! Probably not a big deal but I just feel like my life clock is ticking real fast. 

I fucked up and procrastinated a lot since high school ended. I got an associate's degree and then stopped going to school completely until I figured out what I really wanted to do. 

Last year at 23, I moved out for the first time to live with my bf (currently and ex now) That didnt work out so I came back home with my parents. While I was moved out I realized you cant really go to school for anything that requires clinicals while you have rent to pay. Maybe I could find something part time but the places i want to live in (not the ghetto) cost $950-1400 per month. Rn i make $20 an hour so that's enough to afford a good place, but I kinda hate my job and it's so boring and not me. I dont wanna be stuck here.  If I quit and work part time while in an apartment, by MYSELF, it seems nearly impossible. 

Since I'm with my parents, now is my perfect opportunity to go back to school since the things I want to get into requires you to basically not have a full time job (medical lab science or nursing--you have to do clinicals 40hrs a week, aka no full time job for you) I can get my career going and stay with parents and save for now. Then get my apartment,  pets, etc once I have everything going for me. 

I guess I know which path is best for me (staying with parents) but also I want to experience and enjoy my single 20s the best I can you know?? Because life is short and what if I die b4 I get to experience anything. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place in my decisions lol. 

I would like to keep my same pay and get an apartment. Part of me wants to just take out a big loan to pay for my apartment while I go to school during the clinicals time? Is that a good idea? Theres got to be a way to do both school and living on your own while paying for your bills. Has anyone done this or any recommendations? Being an adult is literally the worst."
5963,Is it normal to be this stressed?,"I’m 22, live in LA. I’m financially on my own now, working a full time job in a career I love. But commuting, paying all these bills, living in such an expensive location, etc, has really been exhausting. Not to mention I sit in all that LA traffic on average of 12 hours a week. I leave work and am too tired to socialize and I look at the others my age around me and they seem to have so much financial support from their parents while I don’t, they’re still “figuring things out,” not in any rush to find a job right away after college. I’m very stressed. Everyday I have shooting pains in my chest that my doctor can’t seem to understand and I’m now on anxiety meds. I just don’t know if this is normal to feel this way, I feel like I should be happy about my career but as I watch all my other friends travel, and party, and socialize it dawns on me I don’t have the same luxury of “figuring things out” and “taking my time.” I am either always working, commuting, or spending my days off running errands and paying bills. This adulting stuff hit me like a ton of bricks!"
6097,What’s the appropriate way to dress for a full time job?,I just graduated with a media degree and I luckily just landed my first full time job at a television network. I don’t think they’re expecting me to wear a suit or anything but it’s desk work in a professional environment and all I own are jeans and t shirts lmao. What outfits should I be looking to buy that are cheap but professional? (just a lot of button up shirts I guess??) What will they be expecting?
6235,Wanna learn how to hold a damn job,"20 years old &amp; finally had the opportunity to secure a full time job (with benefits, paid vacation,etc— all that jazz). I was never able to hold a job because of my mental health &amp; being a high school kid with no real responsibility, I didn’t need to have a job. I always get burnt out too quick but I wanna grow up. As crazy as it sounds, I WANT bills to pay. I want to learn to budget. I want to buy a car, to be able to travel, and purchase what I want whenever (obv after bills and savings). Without a job, I get nada. So, how do I get the discipline to do so?"
6247,How do adults go to the doctor?,"I just started a full time job (8-4:30 M-F) after working two part times for 3 years. How do regular adults with M-F full time jobs make time for doctor’s appointments? Do you always have to take time off? Do you find telehealth or after-hours options? I really need to see a psychiatrist, but I don’t feel comfortable taking time off so early in the new job."
6301,How do you stay updated with news and in general keep educating yourself as an adult?,I’m working my first full time job after graduation. I’m learning lots of new things related to my field. But I want to continue learning or at least maintain a reasonable level of general knowledge. How do I go about reading the news without falling for clickbait and getting jaded because of negative headlines? How do I continue staying educated in general non-career non-hobby topics? Just wanna start some discussion around this.
6537,Does anyone else feel stuck?,"Its almost 9 am &amp; i feel like I've had a panic attack for an hour &amp; i cant go back to sleep. Im 22 &amp; i feel like i am not where i want to be right now at all, I feel like time is passing me by and im completely stuck and i dont know how to get myself out. Im in a relationship right now &amp; my boyfriend has all his life together, great credit, great job, has so much money saved &amp; Could buy a new house if he wanted to. I feel like im holding him back because im just not on his level of success. I have zero credit, I just got a great job before this all happend but got furloughed, &amp; i dont have much money saved up since im not working atm. Growing up, i was very closed in, i never had confidence in my self &amp; my abilities &amp; sometimes i still dont even now. My parents divorced when i was about 8 or 9, i stayed with my dad &amp; he eventually got re married &amp; I felt like i got pushed to the side &amp; I never got to learn the things i needed to that would help me get by in life. I wanted to work during school, i wanted to be independent &amp; My stepmom said that i needed to focus on school &amp; not worry about other things in life, i was so mad but i was helpless, my dad never said anything. I just had to do what i was told &amp; so thats what i did. I never had to necessarily ""adult"" until i was 20 &amp; its not because i wasnt trying or didnt want to, i just never really knew how to go about it. As of now i moved states to live with my older sisters &amp; they've been trying to guide me &amp; push me out of my comfort zone. Before this virus happend, i had just gotten a great full time job that paid 15 an hour, i was happy because i felt like i could finally move forward in life &amp; finally save for what i wanted and needed in life, but as of now, i dont have a car because of an accident, &amp; i havent worked in 2 months because of the pandemic. I was furloughed &amp; then when i finally got scheduled, someone at my job tested positive &amp; i chose not to go in because i just didnt feel that it was worth my life. Now my sisters pissed at me &amp; saying im selfish because alot of people are risking their lives working right now which im not disagreeing with, i know how the world is right now. If i had already been working &amp; wasnt furloughed, I'd still go to work because i was already there &amp; would have already been in contact with whoever tested positive, but its different because i had not been working &amp; i felt it was an even greater risk now. Im not really sure where im going with this, i guess im just rambling. I just wish i was in a better position in my life &amp; i feel like i dont know how to do it."
6651,How do I move out as a graduate student?,"To summarize, I just can’t put up with living with my parents anymore. They are very overbearing and it’s like I’m living with them as a child and not an adult, despite the fact that I’m 22. They’ve made it clear that my input is not needed or wanted on any household decisions that will affect me. There’s no respect for me or my privacy.

I have about $5,000 saved right now. There’s no rush so I could probably get a job (well, i guess it might be a bit complicated with coronavirus and all) and add some more to that. I’m thinking somewhere near a college would be a good place for affordable housing and job availability.

I also plan on taking a full course load for online graduate school. I’ve been accepted already and it’ll be about $4000 a semester, still waiting on financial aid though. Is it feasible to get a full time job and also be enrolled in courses? They’re online so I know they’ll be a lot more flexible.

I also have no idea what I’m talking about as I’ve never properly lived on my own before and I’ve been pretty sheltered. Where would I even begin with this? How much more is this complicated by the covid-19 situation? Any advice would be appreciated."
6655,How should I deal with my 16 year old sister?," So, background info that will help:

My dad has an issue with being alone so he’s constantly meeting new girls and getting new girlfriends one after the other. He met his recent girlfriend at the beach last summer and has fallen madly in love with her for some reason. They constantly spend time together and most of the time he’s never home anymore because he bought a house with her (so me and my sister basically live alone). My dad is so in love or obsessed (or whatever he is) with this woman that he won't miss a single one of her workout classes that she teaches every Tuesday night. If there is something important going on like a doctors appointment or something at school for my sister (she’s in the band), he will cancel and reschedule or just miss it so he doesn’t miss her class. That’s how bad it is. 

Now onto the issue with my sister. 

So the first incident happened when my sister got into a relationship with someone 2 years younger than her. My dad  was never home  so she took it upon herself to sneak this girl into our house. (i’ve never met this girl before). I was extremely upset because I was for 1 never awake when she snuck this girl in and 2 she could have easily invited people into our home and they could have stole something or broke something. Anyway, she kept sneaking this little girl in and I had no choice but to tell dad. So of course he gets mad but he doesn’t really do anything. He doesn’t take her phone or ground her or do anything, but he gets a camera to keep downstairs, and continues spending all of his time with his girlfriend. 

(also, my dad's girlfriend is an alcoholic and my dad kinda is too. They were always having parties on the weekend and lots of drinking was involved and my sister was allowed to drink too ((not that big of a deal when it's in your own household)) and it got to the point where she was WANTING to do it every weekend and would get so drunk she couldn’t even walk or speak correctly. I brought it up to dad and all he did was get pissed at me because he thought i was telling him he's a bad father) My dad “attempted” to tell her she couldn't drink anymore but it continued to happen, and then it got to the point where she was sneaking our dads alcohol when he wasn't home, so I had to tattle on her about that too. Again, my dad must've not taken it that serious because he kept staying nights at a time with his girlfriend. I started trying to put my foot down with my sister since my dad couldn’t and then she started pulling the “i’ll  just kill myself” card on me. So I told my dad about that and then he got mad at me! He threatens to put me in jail and then tells me I need to stop worrying about her and trying to tell her what to do, so then he FORCES  me and my sister to drive 2 hours to him and his girlfriend's new house. 

Long story short… my dad  doesn’t give a shit about my sister and the trouble she’s getting herself into because he’s pussywhiped. My sister is involved with a little girl who changed her completely. She’s addicted to juuls and alcohol, and every-time i try to set her straight everything comes falling back on me. Dad gets mad because he thinks I'm just trying to keep him from seeing his girlfriend, he won't take responsibility and just threatens me and my sister, and I'm only 18!! I've never had kids before and I don't know what to do. I work a full time job and I don't need my sister at home by herself sneaking people in or trying to kill herself because she thinks she’s just a burden or something. I just need some advice on what i should do."
6674,Is it bad/weird to work at a place for only a month?,"Hope this is the right place to ask this. 
More context: I had a full time job at place A for a little over a year and had to resign for health reasons. I am now able to go back to work and applying at different places. I have an interview this week for a part time position at place B. But, I would love my old job back (place A) and have applied for it again. 

I am wondering if it would be weird to accept the position for the part time job at place B and then quit once I get my old job back (assuming I would) at place A. The last time I started that job (place A) it took a while to get a call back and an interview and then actually start the job after orientation. I'm not sure it would be like that again, but I'm guessing so.

So I would be at this part time position at place B for a couple months, I think. 

I just dont know if this would be strange or a waste of place B's time to hire me, or would look weird on my resume or something. 

Thanks for your insight!"
6712,"How to quit a job that I've tried to quit before, but keep getting roped back into","This is pretty long so I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom. 

Anyways, I'm in a bit of a situation and I'm looking for advice on how to go about it. Sorry of this is the wrong sub to post it in, but it's the best one I can think of for this situation.

A bit of background: over the summer, I was in a bit of a weird situation. I was three month out of college without a job in my field (with the pandemic being in it's height) and unemployment benefits were ending. I also didn't have a license to drive so my options were pretty low. Luckily there was an outdoor mall across the street of where I was living and I managed to find a job at a particular store there (don't want to mention what store it is). For the sake of the story, we will call this the OG job. The pay was absolute garbage at $11 an hour (minimum wage where I live is $10 an hour) and hours were very variable (I could work 25 hour a week or 35 hours a week and nothing was ever consistent in the schedule) but it was a job and paid the bills so I kept it. 

Fast forward a few weeks later, I got a license and a car. I made mention to my manager nonchalantly at the OG job that I was looking for a full time job because I wanted to find one that was more consistent. (I felt comfortable doing this because this manager was very personable and gave me life advice). At the end of my shift my manager pulled me aside and asked me when I was going to start looking for jobs and I told her asap. She essentially said she really wanted to keep me there and promoted me to temporary key holder where I got a $0.50 raise even though I had only worked there a month and a half at that point.

About a month later I moved 30 minutes away from the OG job, making my commute 30 minutes there and back. My schedule was still really variable at the OG job and my rent at my new place was higher, so I needed another job. I found one at a retail store making $18 an hour working pretty much 40 hours a week. I still kept the OG job, mostly because I liked being around the people I worked with.

In November, things started to take a toll on me. I was getting stressed out about having to drive thirty minutes to an from the OG job every day  
in addition to working my other job. It didn't help that there was a supervisor there who just absolutely got on everyone's nerves and made them feel stupid for asking a question even if they just started. I was thinking about putting in my two weeks at this point. But then, the manager that I liked from the OG job said they found a full time job and that they would be leaving and I felt bad about quitting at the same time. So I stuck through it for another two weeks until I actually put in my two weeks.

I originally talked to the assistant manager and told him I was putting in my two weeks, but he told me that he couldn't do anything about it because he wasn't the store manager. However, this day just happened to be the new managers first day. She had experience managing a different store in the same chain, so she kind of jumped right onto things. When I td her I wanted to put in my two weeks
she told me that I was a nessecary part of the store (or at least that's what the old manager told her) and asked if there was anything she could do to keep me there. I explained the situation of having to drive an hour every day to get to and from work and already having a second job. I also mentioned I needed more money for me to keep staying there. Her suggestion was to have me work less days a week, with longer shifts but apparently couldn't do anything about money. Foolishly I accepted. 

A few days later, the DISTRICT MANAGER came on and apparently my store manager of the OG job made mention to them that I wanted to quit. So, the district manager told me (in a joking manner I think) that of she doesn't ever want to hear that I'm putting in my two weeks again and then gave me a coupon to go pick out a free product from the store for ""all my hard work"" (essentially like a 'thanks-for-staying' gift).

Well, now I want to quit for real this time. Management has taken an absolute turn for the worst to the point where there will be three upper level management people working and myself working and all three of them will go in the back, leaving me to ring up and sell stuff to 40 customers at a time. Corporates expectations are stupid and unattainable, and yet me and the lower level staff get yelled at when we don't achieve it. I honestly feel like I'm just being used at this place and that they're just walking all over me. Plus, me driving an hour there and home and only working 18 hours a week (if I'm lucky) at $11.50 an hour is really just not worth the time and stress that I put into the OG job. Especially when I have a better paying job that is a 10 minute drive from my house. 

How do I put in my two weeks without them guilt tripping me or roping me back in? Do I just upright quit and walk out or do I put on my two weeks? I am absolutely DONE with this job and am still not sure if I want to use them as a reference.

TL;DR: Got a job over the summer to help pay bills. Pay was/is horrendous and hours were not stable, but it was across the street and I couldn't drive so I kept it. Casually told my manager I was looking for more consistent better paying jobs, and they promoted me to temporary key holder to keep me there. Eventually got a license and a car, and moved 30 minutes away. Found a better paying job. Few weeks later, I was stressing about the job and wanted to quit. Verbally told the manager I was putting in my two weeks because of the drive I had to take and the other job I had and she asked if working less days and longer shifts would help. I agreed and stayed. Manager told the district manager that I had put in my two weeks and the district manager told me (jokingly) to never put in my two weeks again and gave me a coupon for a free item in the store. Management has become significantly worse, and I feel being used. I want to leave. What's the best way to do this without being roped back in?"
6750,Stay in family business or hit the road? Needing perspective.,"My family and I (24F) have had a book business for the past nine years -- we write fiction books and sell them online. Unfortunately, the business hasn't yet been profitable, and I hate to say it...has \*probably\* made 3K in sales total so far. Yet, I love the business (I've lately edited the past few novels we've had \[paid a few hundred dollars for the past 2-3 projects\] but my sibling and I also help in general ways as in writing emails, reviewing illustrations from artists as a family, social media posts, etc.)

But, I also want to move in the next year or so, or 1.5 years at latest. I've been graduated from college for almost two years now, and I also have a history of being far too dependent on and...sheltered?...by my family already, and I really feel the need to get more solo life experience and become independent. This extends into socialization too, where as soon as COVID is over, I'm getting out there more, because I pretty much only have, and have had, my family in my life and I know it's time to really change this. So, some rough plan for me looks like getting a full time job ASAP and working, doing more social outings, and saving for the next year and a half so I can move/travel/move+work abroad at the end of it.

This would put a wrench in the business because my parents aren't willing to send manuscripts electronically for editing because of potental 'stealing by others' concerns. I also feel so bad because my parents are obviously very disappointed by the business output so far, and are very determined to make this their future exclusive income at minimum and into a hugely successful company at best. I feel a pressure to stay for longer and keep hustling here so something sparks.

Yet, I can't keep delaying, right? What would you do if you were in my position?

\*cue ""Should I Stay or Should I Go""\*

TL;DR -- I'm (24F) debating between staying at home to work the family book business (risking further dependence and shelteredness) or moving away in the coming year (which would end my ties to the business). Which road to take?"
6807,Successes and struggles coexist,"Adulting is hard, Damn it. When I (18F) joined this sub I was struggling with finding a job, getting a license, etc. Just trying to get my life together and my independence started. I finished high school in 2019 and proceeded to take a year off from school because I had burnt myself out by doing so much work and having advanced courses. I was parenting my little sister, attempting to mend my very broken relationship with at least one of my parents, trying to keep my boyfriend from being homeless, and suffering from severe depression. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to go to college due to expenses and I could barely get myself out of bed because I was so tired and suicidal. Overall, it was a very rough patch for me. HOWEVER, as of now I have gotten myself a full time job that I enjoy (even though it only pays minimum), a license and a car, an absent but at least neutral relationship with my parents. My (now ex) boyfriend lives with me and we are actually better friends now than we ever were as partners. I have gotten myself on antidepressants which seem to help me get out of bed in the morning. I'm even registered to start college in 6 weeks. I've made a lot of improvements recently and I felt as though I should share it here as I don't really have anyone else to share with who might relate. At the same time, I feel like I'm still really struggling to be independent. I live in a house owned by a non-nuclear family member who really seems to dislike me. When coronavirus hit, she spent most of her time away from the house living somewhere else with her partner. I was maintaining the house by myself and I was honestly doing a good job. Last month, she abruptly moved back into the house full time and works from home. Now, every time I leave my room I'm getting yelled at for absurd reasons that aren't even my fault or problems that don't exist. I'm so scared to be at my own ""home"" I try to shower at my friends house or at 2am when nobody else is awake. I have a mini fridge in my room because she threw out all my new groceries from the kitchen fridge and I haven't cooked anything since she moved back in because I'm scared to be downstairs. I've been apartment hunting for months but it now feels like a necessity to GTFO of here ASAP. Every place I find is either in the ghetto and super sketchy (I drove past an apartment building just to see it and there were armed men stopping vehicles) or they refuse to rent to college kids or anyone without credit. It's causing extreme stress for me and the people I intended to move into an apartment with because we all have pretty bed home lives. Any advice that y'all have would be appreciated but more than anything I was just looking to get some stuff off my chest and share with a community who may understand. Thanks :)"
6872,Why does enrolling in health insurance have a time limit??,"Someone please explain this to me. I'm 23 and just starting out on my own. Until earlier this year, my health insurance was covered. Then I was suddenly informed by both my parents that I wasn't on their plans anymore because it was too expensive, and open enrollment ended soon after before I could scrape up the money to get a plan. I'm trying to get insurance figured out since I got a new full time job, but it got me wondering: why is health insurance not like every other insurance I'm aware of where I can call an agency, get quotes, and enroll in any time of the year? Whats with the time limits? Can anyone more versed in trying to be an adult in the USA please explain this?"
6918,How to make and maintain good credit?,"I'm 18 and just out of high school. I had to full throttle into adulthood and managed to get an apartment, and a full time job. But I've never been taught how to do anything with credit. 
I want to find the best way possible to build good credit, and maintain a good credit score but I have no idea where to look and what to listen to. 
If anyone has any literature or advice it would be greatly appreciated:)"
6939,(19M)Should I lie on my resume? Struggling incredibly hard to land even a simple job amidst financial struggles.,"As the post suggests, I'm 19 and I haven't been able to secure a job at all. Even for the ones that state that 'no experience is needed'. I know I've been rejected as I don't even get an automated rejection email. At this point, should I just lie on my resume so that at the very least I can land an interview? I'm not talking massive lies, but small ones that'll make my resume seem more fit to my age. 

The only two jobs I ever did manage to land was working at a grocery store, but I had to hand in my notice as I was unable to consistently get to work on time since my college was on the otherside of my workplace (it takes me about 45 minutes by bus to get me from one place to the other) and I would be asked to get to work the hour after my timetable at college finished (e.g I'd finish college at 5 and be asked to go into work at 6). I didn't have (and still don't) a personal vehicle so taking the bus was pretty much the only way I'd be guaranteed to get there. The other was a temporary Christmas placement.

While I understand that the corona pandemic has made this endeavor even harder (especially to those who lost their previous job due to it), its come down to the fact that I'm struggling financially and need some form of monetary aid to gain some peace of mind. I'm going to be continuing my college degree this following September, but am debating on dropping out for the sake of landing a potential full time job for the sake of making sure I can at least have some financial peace of mind.

For those who might be wondering, my parents are supportive of me and try their best to provide me with everything I need and want. However, I live alone and my parents work abroad (through no choice of their own) meaning it's hard enough as it is for them to provide me with the support they want to. Not to mention, they also need to pay for both my sisters university tuition (shes living with my mom currently) and my brothers costs.  

I do have experiences outside of work, such as volunteering, community service, extracurricular activities, etc. And I made sure to put them into my resume (and update it accordingly), but even still I get rejected. For reference, I live in the South West UK area.

In all honesty, I'm in the situation I'm in due to my stupidity, absolutely horrid social anxiety, and the inability to motivate myself to put myself out there for fear of judgment. I'm aware of this and am now asking for genuine advice on how to proceed from here as I just want to be proud and happy with myself. More than anything.

Tldr: I was stupid with many things (money being one of them) and am now struggling. How can I land a job to give me some form of peace of mind? Should I lie on my resume?"
6978,(19M) I just got my first full time job! Should I commute or get a place near by?,"Hi all, I’m 19 and just scored my first time job as a helper to an electrician. I’m not close to either of my parents and neither of them are great examples of adults, so I guess I’ll be asking here about what I should do 

I was living at my college from January to August, but I had to leave since I decided on going to trade school instead. Now I’ve been living at my mothers for a week, but I can’t stay in permanently since she has government assisted housing due to her mental illness. 

My job is an hour away which equals 100 miles on my car there and back. The job starts at 7:30am and ends around 5:30pm. 

I start this Monday and I’m thinking of staying at an Airbnb for $269 for 5 days so that I can be close to my job and don’t have to worry about commuting and can see if it’d be worth getting my own place out there. 

I’ll be getting paid $15 an hour on the books, but I don’t know how much will be deducted from tax or how much I’ll be getting weekly to truly calculate how much I’ll be making and what kind of apartment I could afford, which is why I’m debating on living at air bnbs instead of an apartment OR just staying at the Airbnb for a week. 

I’m not sure what to do, I feel like this all comes down to whether I want to save time or money. 

I can either commute a total of 10 hours per week and save $269 from not staying at an airbnb, but have to pay about $40 in gas and put around 400 miles on my car and get up at 5am

Or get up around 6am, be right near my job, but have to pay close to $300 on a place for a place to stay for 5 days. 

Any advice would be really appreciated, thank you."
6989,Does Non alcoholic wine exist?,"I’m someone who primarily drinks water. Seltzer water, plain Jane water, you name it. Don’t drink caffeine, soda, etc and have a tea now and then. Needless to say, sometimes I crave alternatives to water. So when I’m stressed, I really enjoy the taste of a glass of red (dry) wine.

I’m getting ready to start my PhD part time while working a full time job in healthcare, and I feel the stress building. I don’t think wine can/should be my only non-water go to, and am looking for some non alcoholic options. It exists for beer, so I figured I’d poll this group: any options in the wine realm I could try?"

7533,Will full time work always stop my social life,"So I’ve recently started my first full time job. (So happy about it!) I’ve worked since I was 17, only part time jobs but often doing 40 hour+ weeks sometimes, just never permanently like now.

Since I’ve been full time i’m struggling so much to find energy to socialise and go out. I pretty much live with my partner so I see him nearly everyday and we go out every friday with his friend group, I see my parents separately once or twice a fortnight each. (They’re my priorities.) I see the weekend as recovery time where I just wana have a lie in with my partner and relax to be honest.

When it comes to friends i’m just so drained and can only manage to meet one person a week, sometimes not even that. My jobs really physically demanding where I’m pretty much always on my feet or driving, I wake up for work at 6ish and don’t get in til gone 5 as well, so by the time i’ve showered and everything when i’m home, i’m just ready to collapse somedays. I’ve explained this to a few friends and I meet up with each friend once every two months or so, I just feel so drained and feel like such a bad friend for never wanting to go out. There’s about  6 friends who I want to hang out with but can’t regularly.

Does anyone feel the same or have any tips? Please tell me i’ll get used to this and i’m not labelled as the boring young adult forever."

There are loads of apartments that allow pets, within my price range ($550-700/mo)  However, at the moment none of them have openings.  Like at all.  Even the ones who say they do on Zillow and [Apartments.com](https://Apartments.com).  The only places with openings are the upscale apartments - one I'm looking at is $1145/mo for a one bedroom.  I bring home $2505/mo so I could conceivably swing it, but I was hoping to move up to an apartment like that once I am in the $60K range at work.

IF that large price includes everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) I'd be more open to considering it.  I'm going to swing by the leasing office at lunch to ask.

I need to get out of my moms house.  She's not stable and reliable with money, and I'm having to pay bills that aren't my responsibility because she has no idea what's going on.

8097,Adult With no health insurance,What options are there for young people that do not live in a state(Texas) that offers Medicaid or Obama care to adults with no kids or dependents. I have no issues that would prevent me from working a full time job. How can I get affordable health insurance?
8228,Trying to go from spoiled dependence to adult independence. Advice?,"hi, everyone. i’ll try to keep this as succinct as possible.

i’m almost 24. i have loving parents who pay for my everything and always have, but i want to become independent and move out soon. because i’m so dependent they have rules and expectations (not allowed to date, for example, among others) that i think impede my growth and freedom as an adult that’s unhealthy for my age. never minding the rules, the dependence and delay in life experiences alone is unhealthy i think.

i graduated college in 2019 with a music performance degree. music was the most interesting thing for me to major in, the college was cheap and local and i got good scholarships there, i learned a lot, but because the degree was in classical singing and i’ve learned that my interests are in pop/contemporary singing, im training my voice in this style for my future career. however, covid has shut down performance opportunities whether pop or opera so it’s not possible to earn money from this right now anyway.

aside from one being retired and the other having another job, my parents have a fiction writing business and i help out a lot (edit all books, help with illustrations, etc.), but to be honest, we have yet to be profitable. also, for the past 8 months, i work online (about 5 hours a day) for minimum wage pay as an ESL tutor, just to earn some money during covid.

that’s the background. my question.

i’m considering creating my own business (most likely non music related because training and networking will take years before becoming profitable) since i have time and a great safety net to do this, and hopefully it can become my reliable income by time i move out (which i’d like to do in 1.5 years in the latest).

but, i don’t have any strong ideas what the business could be. i always imagined this business being my income while i travel and slowly develop my music career on the side, and my parents have always encouraged entrepreneurship, but i’m so stuck right now.

i could stay at home and keep working for my family business, but who knows how long that will take for it to be profitable, and that would also delay my adult independence. it would have to be staying at home because my parents aren’t comfortable with sending manuscripts through email for editing (possibility of someone else stealing or seeing their work before released), so i would actually have to stay home.

and i could also get a full time job, or waitress or something, but yet my parents are highly concerned about covid and wouldn’t let me get an in person job right now, and i wonder if finding a remote one would be difficult. the car i drive is also their car, technically, so they have ultimate say over this. furthermore, if i have time to create a business i’d like to take that chance instead, but again, i’m stuck at what to do.

not to mention that everyone says “travel when you’re young”, which i plan on doing 100% financially funded by me, but i feel like i’m both stuck in this current predicament and also losing years to do this young traveling.

any advice for my situation would be very much appreciated.

**TL;DR -- I've depended on my parents for my entire life and now need to be independent. Stuck between creating my own business, getting a job, or staying and working for the family business.**"
8315,Tips to buying homes?,"I am only 18, just barely moved out on my own, but I’m still trying to prepare for owning a home. I live with my fiancée of 6 months in a small 1 bed/1 bath for a fair price. 

We want to have our home bought by the time we’re 25, but we know that’s a lot of work to do in 7 years. So here’s a little more financial background. 

I started building my credit in October with a credit card I use for gas in my car. I have a credit score in the good range, and I’ve heard that to get a house, typical scores should be 720-750 minimum. I’m slowly working my way there and I’m hopeful I’ll be there in a couple years. I’ve never had a late payment on rent or my credit card bills. 

My fiancée hasn’t got a credit card yet, but she’s saving all her money and she’s out of work right now with the pandemic going on, but once she’s got a full time job again, we’ll be putting $2,000 minimum into savings every single month. 

Aside from getting her credit built up, what else should we be doing to prepare to buy a home in the next 7 years?"
8534,Why do I feel so unfulfilled even though I shouldn’t be?,"Basically I’m 29 years old, I live in NYC with my parents and work a full time job. Right now I feel extremely unfulfilled with life and I have no idea why.

I struggle with autism and adhd, making college and work a difficult venture for me. But I’m trying really hard to improve despite my faults. 

Right now my job doesn’t pay great, but I my major goal is to move out of NYC and find an apartment to live on my own. The reasons why is that NYC is too expensive and I feel like I’m missing out not living on my own (I commuted and finished my bachelors online).

I don’t have any friends as I was only focused on graduating and finding a job. I thought that that was all I needed to be comfortable with myself.

Now I feel unfulfilled, I lost all my friends and my family is becoming more agitated with me. They’re against me moving out as they want me to stay in New York, but how can I live in this expensive city? 

Right now I just feel empty and focused on my goal of adding more money to my savings. I also recently got back in touch with a goal of teaching English abroad.

But right now, things are closed and we don’t know if things will improve for future teachers."
8587,Just got my first full time job after college graduation and I’m really scared I’ll be unable to wake up for it and mess things up.,"My anxiety has been through the roof lately since I start my first day at my new job this Tuesday. I have to be there by 7:30am and end around 5:30-6pm. However this means I have to be up at 5:30am to start showering and getting ready for the day. I’ve always been a shower in the morning type person but for an extra 30 minutes of sleep I am seriously considering night time showering even if it means having my hair in a pony tail everyday. 


Anyways I am a Major night owl, like I don’t get to bed until 12-3amish. And quarantine has not helped at all. Well I landed a great job but I’m so terrified I’ll mess it up and sleep through my alarm since I am a very heavy sleeper. I already have 20+ alarms on my phone, a nightstand alarm clock and I just ordered another that’s extra loud to place across my room to see if that helps. Has anyone else gone through this or has any advice of being a night owl that needs to suddenly wake up early? 

Additionally I’ve also found the idea of a full time job very depressing. Maybe because the last 5 years for me has been college and a part time flexible job but the idea of “work sleep repeat” sounds miserable. I keep dwelling on the idea of “I’ll get home by 6-6:30, then I’ll have to go to bed by 10:30-11 which means I only have 4 hours to spend quality time with my boyfriend or do anything. It doesn’t seem like much and I’m worried I’ll get in a rut of just depression routine and not allow myself to do much because I’ll be worried about the time. 

Any advice on being more adult here, waking up early, and tips on handling the switch of working everyday for the rest of your life? 😅"

8867,Should I stay on my moms insurance until the end of the year in return for her to claim me as a dependent for this year? Please help.,"Hello, I’m 23, soon to be 24. I just graduated college and due to that my mom can’t claim me as a dependent come 2021. However I landed a full time job a month and a half ago and have to enroll in my benefits now paying $400 a month for insurance and file independent OR remain on her insurance until December 2020 and enroll in January under a “life change event” such as losing insurance. 

My primary thing is my mom has always been sketchy with money and taxes and tries to keep me out of it. But I want to be more informed and making my own personal choices here. I’m curious if anyone know how it may affect me working full time to be claimed as a dependent for this coming tax season. Will I lose money or owe more for this situation? 

Essentially should I stay on my moms insurance until the end of this year and file dependent BUT save $1,400 just in insurance costs. Or should I get the benefits (which aren’t the best) through my company employer now, not save the money, but have the satisfaction of filing independent? I’m very uneducated on taxes so I’m not sure how either situation affects me."
8896,Taking a job that pays less,"So right now I work at a bakery in a big grocery store chain. I don't like it very much but I didn't really expexct to and I know you're not gonna like every job you have. I make about 12/hr, work roughly 25hrs a week and I am part-time despite asking for full time often. I can't drive so my boyfriend has to drive me there AND take me home, 20min voth ways. My shifts are all over the place and I often get home clise to midnight. The work itself isn't that hard (although I am really sore at the end of my shifts) but my mental health definitely takes a toll.

Today I went into a local candy shop and I loved it in there, the lady behind the counter said they were hiring so I gave her my information. I could literally walk there every day it's so close to my house, they have a full time job available and I would be getting home by like 8:30pm every day. I don't know what the pay is yet, but I suspect it will be much lower than the $12 and hour I make at the bakery. I feel I would be much happier there at the candy shop, but if it pays less I feel like it would be stupid to take it, right?

I am working on creative projects that I feel would bring in money if I had the time to work on them consistently. Working at the bakery makes this difficult since my hours are never consistent, I can't develop a routine (which helps my depression and ADHD) outside of work. 

Assuming I would still be able to pay all my bills, do you think it's foolish to take a job that pays less even though I like everything else about it? I graduated in December and I want to go to grad school next year, so I'm not trying to build a full career in my major right now, just save money for grad school."

Should I apply for a loan? A big one just to pay off my medical bills and credit card and then save the rest to help start building up money."
8973,Coping with the lack of time after work,"I am very lucky to have a full time job. It's your standard 9-5. But I feel like I get nothing done after work, anyone else feel like this? After waking up early, commuting to the office, 8 hours of work then another commute in traffic. I get home totally exhausted and not motivated to do anything. I get home, do the dinner thing, and suddenly the few hours after work are gone and it's 10:30 time for bed, just to rinse and repeat.  How do you find motivation to work out, continue a hobby or even clean?"
9116,Looking for first job,"I (17F) graduated high school in June 2020, and I’ve slowly been working on making a resume and looking around at job listings. 

Is it possible to avoid a fast food or cashier job? If so, what kind of jobs should I be looking for? Also is it a bad idea to try to get a full time job as my first job? Lastly does anyone have any advice or tips for anything at all? 

Some info if it helps: I don’t have a driver’s license, I live in Ontario, Canada, I’m not going to university this fall but plan to the year after. I am very anxious around people which is why I’m hoping to avoid a cashier job."
9131,Getting a credit card/building credit,"I’m 20 years old and I have 1 more year of college left, and I think I should start building credit while I’m still a student. Hopefully I’ll have a full time job secured by graduation, and with that I’d like to have some credit built. I wish I posted this at the start of college, but hey, hopefully it’s not too late.

I have a couple concerns/questions:
Do I need to have a constant source of income to apply for a credit card? I’m currently getting unemployment benefits, so would that count as a source of income?

I really don’t have many hefty monthly purchases like tuition or rent because my parents pay for all of that (which I am incredibly grateful for!) so would it be reasonable to still apply for a credit card when the only things I buy are things like gas &amp; groceries? 

I know some of these questions I could likely find answers in a google search, but it would be awesome to hear anyone’s input on my situation! Any advice or suggestions on banks or types of cards I would greatly appreciate!"
9237,I've decided I'm only going to eat the flavors I like from the fruit gummies pack and that's okay because I'm a freaking adult,"I was one of those 'old soul' kids. So responsible and level-headed. Job at 15, car (I paid for everything) at 16, moved out at 18, bought a home at 19, full time job at a bank, very respectable. I did everything I could to become an adult as fast and thoroughly as I could. None of that was bad, but there were other consequences to my choices. 

In some ways, I went too fast. I had to back up and undo and redo many of my so-called adult accomplishments. I sold my house and moved back in with my folks so I could afford college. I sold my car so I could afford to move to another state for grad school. I graduated into the recession (the first one). I learned how to tell the difference between fair weather friends and real ones. 

It took me until I was 30 to have a full-time job again. Until I was 32 to have a car, and 37 to live in my own house again (and I'm still just renting). But you know, I don't feel bad about any of it. Now I'm sitting here eating only the gummies I like just because I can. 

Many things about adulting are okay and a few suck and some are good. But the great thing about adulting is that I get to decide how much of it I want to do. It took a while to realize that."
9251,"First Full Time Job, Boss Lied About Starting Pay","So I recently started my first full time job as a seamstress. There have been some red flags, for one, I was hired on the spot and the boss does not talk to her employees with any respect, hence the turnover rate is fast. I feel like I am learning a lot and improving my skills which is a positive for me, however, when I was interviewed I was told that my starting pay would be $13 an hour. Well two weeks have passed and I have received two checks for $320. I felt like this seemed low for working 40 hours a week but I thought it may have to do with taxes, (I file as single and independent). I realize now that I was likely lied to about my starting pay and don’t know how to approach this situation. I work for a small business so there isn’t really anyone I can talk to in regards to Human Resources. Should I quit? Demand reimbursement?"
9331,How to get an apartment at 15?," Hi there, I am an orphan in Michigan that is currently placed with a foster parent. I work a full time job, and am hoping to start earning college credits in addition to my high school courses. I understand that there are independent living programs for people in my situation, but I am already a very mature and fiscally independent person and to be honest I don't think daily meetings about how to do laundry properly or balance a budget are going to give me any benefit. I'm trying my best to figure out how to get an apartment signed for me for the next year before I go to live on a college campus. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"
