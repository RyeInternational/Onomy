# rye_data_project_spring2021

This project is presented by the Data Project Team of Rye International which collaborates with onomy for market analysis. Rye International is a professional fellowship club at UCLA with a data science track for interested students to share their academic and professional resources. With a team of 4 undergraduate students, we explored datasets and methods independently to answer business questions raised by onomy during our five months of collaboration. Our main goal is to provide insights into the current online education market and to decode peopleâ€™s sentiment around adulting challenges. In the post series of this project, we involved text mining, topic modeling, and emotional detection.

## Online Education Market Analysis
We analyzed the composition, number of subscribers, and length of courses offered by platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube.
Coursera and Udemy focus on career education that teaches general business skills. However, they have few courses related to adulting issues like the ones mentioned above. Several YouTubers have videos to introduce investing, insurance, and taxes, but they are too short and lack a structured syllabus.
