# Onomy x Rye Data Project

This project is presented by the Data Project Team of Rye International which collaborates with onomy for market analysis. Rye International is a professional fellowship club at UCLA with a data science track for interested students to share their academic and professional resources. With a team of 4 undergraduate students, we explored datasets and methods independently to answer business questions raised by onomy during our five months of collaboration. Our main goal is to provide insights into the current online education market and to decode people’s sentiment around adulting challenges. In the post series of this project, we involved text mining, topic modeling, and emotional detection.

## Online Education Market Analysis
We analyzed the **composition, number of subscribers, and length of courses** offered by platforms such as **Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube.**
Coursera and Udemy focus on career education that teaches general business skills. However, they have few courses related to adulting issues like the ones mentioned above. Several YouTubers have videos to introduce investing, insurance, and taxes, but they are too short and lack a structured syllabus.

## Word Frequency Analysis for Reddit
We deployed bigram word-frequency analysis and word clouds to identify several keywords that are of particular value in discussions around adulting: As youth approach adulthood, **Roth IRAs, savings and brokerage accounts, emergency funds, credit cards and student loans** are at the focal point of people’s struggle for financial independence, while **age, the high school experience, mental health and social media** are also receiving significant attention.

## Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling for Reddit
We conducted sentiment analysis and topic modeling to learn about people’s feelings towards adulting challenges mentioned above. There are three main takaways:
1.  People need advice on the **usage of credit cards and ways to improve credit scores**. They **worry** about paying back debt.
2.  Current college students hold **positive** expectations towards adulthood, while recent graduates feel **lost** after getting independent. The cost of schooling and mental health issues in college also **depressed** people.
3.  **Money and housing** is the focal point of **parental relationships** in adulting. Parents who support their children mentally and financially after they become adults usually maintain a good relationship. The same happens for those young adults who have learned how to plan their lives and future from their parents. However, living with parents as an adult often leads to **battle, guilt, and depression**. 
In general, we hope to understand people's needs and come up with more optimal solutions for their struggling to adulthood.See more on our [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@ryeinternational/struggling-to-adulthood-sentiment-analysis-and-topic-modeling-for-reddit-4f20463ef5da)
