       "  'selftext': \"You’re moving out. Great! Whether it’s from home or from the dorms into off campus housing there are few things you should know about renting an apartment or house. Basics The monthly cost to live not just the rental price. That is the baseline. The true cost is is rent + internet/cable + electricity + water + heat +...+…+… Your monthly budget should account for all of these expenses. Some properties include some or all utilities, others do not. Factor that in when comparing rental costs. You can ask the utility what the average monthly bill at your address was in previous years when you sign up to get an idea of the cost. Most landlords insist that all tenants sign the same lease. This makes you and your friends/frenemies/randos you find through Craigslist collectively responsible for the full rental amount. If your roommate can’t pay on time you still owe the full amount.  You are all collectively responsible for damage to the property. The landlord is not a judge and doesn’t care who broke the shelf in the kitchen. They only care about the broken shelf. You will have to reach an agreement with your roommates – ideally before anything happens – about how damage deposits will be handled in the event they are assessed.  Read the lease. Focus on the “End of Tenancy” section. Most leases require that you give notice 30 or more days before the end of the lease if you do not intend to continue renting. If you do not give this notice many leases anticipate switching over to month-to-month tenancy. The Landlord will not assume that you plan to move out and you may end up paying for one or more extra months of occupancy because you did not follow the lease.  Read the lease again. Focus on the “Notice” section. You will note that it does not list the Landlord’s telephone number. This means that for the purposes of moving out, or disputing something, or otherwise complying formally with the terms of the lease you will be required to do what is described there – usually either first class mail or less frequently email. You may have a tradition of contacting the landlord via phone - but if the issue comes before a court of law you want proof that you complied with the notice section.  Avoid if at all possible any arrangement that results in you paying rent in cash or by money order. Neither of those generate records. If you have to pay by either of those methods insist on a written receipt each month and keep it. Roommates Choose wisely. Your BFF from High School might or might not be a bad choice. Was she always borrowing money from people? Probably not a good sign. It's better to share a place with a responsible person who is no fun than a fun person who isn't responsible.  You are in this together. If you wouldn't trust them holding  5-10,000 of your money in their hands for a week - then it probably wouldn't be a good idea to rent with them - because that's the amount of power they have over you.  Trust, but verify. If you give money to your roommate who then pays the Landlord, ask for a copy of the check. Many people get screwed over when they've been paying rent the whole time but it's been used to finance roomie's partying. If the option exists - always use personal checks to the landlord, that way you have proof in the form of bank records that the rent was paid.  Moving in &amp; out Make sure to do a walkthrough of the apartment with the landlord or their agent prior to occupancy. Note all damage and wear. Take photographs of everything and save copies somewhere other than your phone. This is not the time to be polite and not mention a scuff. Keep a copy of the damage walkthrough, don’t rely on the landlord to keep records.  Don’t plan to move out the last day of your lease. Give yourself time to have a clean apartment. Plan to do the walkthrough with all roommates present, and have your copy of the report from the day you moved in.  Read the rules in your jurisdiction as they relate to return of damage deposits. Be wary. Do not let the Landlord charge you for normal wear and tear. Almost every city/state has laws requiring the money to be either returned or the reasons for retention explained within a certain period after you surrender occupancy. Familiarize yourself with those laws. Evictions &amp; Breaking leases You never want an eviction on your record. They follow you around like a scarlet letter. Your next landlord will not care that you were evicted because your roommate was “a dick” who didn’t pay his rent. Don’t get in that situation. You cannot kick your roommate out. They cannot kick you out. Only the Landlord can evict you. This includes when your roommate is your spouse or girl/boyfriend. It doesn't matter that they slept with that slut Gina.  Do not get screwed by a roommate. This means make sure to get proof that the rent has been paid each and every month if they are remotely shady. If they stop paying, you could be evicted even though you are current.  If you can't pay rent try to negotiate a way out that doesn't result in an eviction. Most Landlords are reasonable. They're in it for the money, not the thrill of taking people to court.  If you need to break the lease - expect to pay. In certain cities like San Francisco or Seattle someone will be waiting to snap up your lease on a moment's notice. That isn't true everywhere. Be prepared to make an offer to the landlord to let you out earlyRent Abatement You cannot choose to not pay rent if the landlord doesn’t fix something as a way of spurring them to action. Mostly. There are a few limited exceptions that are specified in the laws of your state - look them up. Even then they require action within a limited period of time once the landlord is notified. Remember “notification” means something different in leases than in real life. That often means you need to mail something to the landlord at the official address. If it is something small, like ants – just put on your adult pants and go to the store and buy ant baits. Don’t waste the landlord’s time and (more importantly) their good will on small issues. Same with lightbulbs and batteries for the smoke detectors. You can’t withhold rent on these issues.  Utilities You will probably have to sign up for one or more utility services. Make sure to terminate them on move out. This is doubly true if you move out but some of your roommates are staying on. Everybody has a horror story of a friend that never changed the electric bill and had to spend time trying to collect from the next set of tenants who moved in. Don't be the source of the next round of those stories - just be the person who laughs at them. Have a plan to budget and pay for these. Some are billed monthly, others bi-monthly. Keep a separate account at your bank if you have trouble keeping money in your main debit account. Sub-leases If you can avoid doing this, avoid it.  If you have to get a sublessee try to get the landlord to agree to have them take over your lease, rather than you acting as a jr. landlord. It’s worth  20- 50 per month remaining on the contract, at a minimum – so if there are six months remaining offer the landlord  300 cash to re-write the lease now. You get out with your security deposit and no headaches.  If your only option is to have a sublease then do a walk through with them, get the damage deposit from them, and in all other ways behave as if you are a landlord. You do not want to be on the hook for thousands of dollars because of damage they cause. Protect yourself.  If you are going to be sub-leasing then treat the person you are leasing from as a landlord and follow the steps listed here. Pets If the building is no pets – then don’t bring a pet. Don’t try to get a doctor to write you a prescription for an emotional service animal so you can get around it. Don't be that guy. Really you shouldn't even be friends with that guy. He's a dick.   If your lease requires a pet deposit, pay it. If there is a requirement for extra rent each month for a pet, pay that too. Don’t try to scam your landlord. Renter’s Insurance This is a 100% must have.  Get as much as you can. It costs almost nothing. It will protect you in all kinds of situations. If you are robbed, water damage, someone injured, or any of dozens other possible eventualities it will help you.  You can probably get it through the same people that do your car insurance. Big Picture Your relationship with your landlord is important. They can be your best ally or your worst nightmare. But think of them like you think of the Police. Ideally you have no interaction - but when you do it's because they are providing you with a service not responding because you screwed up somehow. Don't call them over stupid issues that you can handle.  It's not Black Mold. Yeah, I know it's black and it's mold. It's not Black Mold, however. 99% of the time you can clean it with a sponge and some disinfectant. It’s kind of intimidating, but all of this is actually easy. Good luck in your new place. \"},\n",

Congratulations, and welcome home.In this 101, we'll talk about the very least you need to buy for your kitchen.   This assumes that you have nothing and that you are the one doing the buying.  It also assumes you don't have more than three roommates who will be sharing the kitchen with you.This also assumes that you will be doing some (at least minimal) kind of cooking or meal preparation -- at least eggs, tacos, pasta, that sort of thing.  We'll talk more about cooking and how to learn to do it in the future, but for now, let's start with equipping a basic, economical kitchen with the very basics.  You can do this on a budget of  225- 250 or so, maybe less if you are clever with coupons and sales.(Note:  My links are to Amazon because I do a lot of shopping there and I know how to find things quickly.  You can find equivalent items for similar prices at stores like Target, Walmart, etc.   And I use Amazon Smile because it's nice to donate to charity!  Choose your own when you log in for the first time.)  Dishware:The first thing you'll need are some dishes; big ones, small ones, bowls.  You don't need anything fancy here.  A basic service for four can be had [here](  for as low as  28.  That includes big and small plates, coffee cups, and bowls you can use for salads or cereal.  What you want to look for is something reasonably durable and lightweight.  I also recommend a service for four for up to four people for the simple reason that it will prevent dishes from piling up!Flatware (aka utensils):Again, you don't need anything fancy for your first place.  [This] (  service for four has 20 pieces, and will fit your needs.You'll also need a decent set of knives] (   if you plan to cut anything more than butter.  Glassware:Coffee cups are covered in your dishware purchase, so you really only need some clear drinking glasses.  This set has [4 of each](  of three different sizes.  They can double as stemless wine glasses or cocktail glasses.  If you want something you can take outside, consider acrylic or durable plastic instead of glass.Serving Dishes:If you are living alone, you may not need any serving dishes or utensils to start -- if you have an occasional guest your regular dishes can serve double duty.  If you have roommates, though, you might want to consider adding a few serving dishes like [this one] (  in different shapes and sizes.  One bowl and one rectangular-shaped dish will probably do.   Things for Cooking:Sets really come in handy here.  You may end up with a few more things than you really need, but you will still pay less than you would for individual pieces.A set like [this one] (  includes most of the basics you need for cooking and serving.  It has spoons for cooking and serving, a peeler, a manual can opener, a corkscrew, measuring cups and spoons, etc.  Eventually you may want to get fancier versions of some of these, but for now, this will do, all for about  20.   The only thing I think this set is missing is a [set of wooden spoons](  and maybe some kind of jar to keep everything in on your counter, unless you have the drawer space.A [basic bakeware set](   is for more than just cookies. You can use it to broil chicken, steak or vegetables, bake homemade mac and cheese, and do a lot of other simple, oven-centric cooking.  Oh, and I'll teach you how to make the best chocolate chip cookies in the universe in a future 101.  With any bakeware, from this inexpensive set to the best you can buy, you want durable and easy to clean.Basic cookware, meaning at least [one good size skillet](  and [one good size saucepan](    For not much more money you can get a quite good [set like this one] (   with a lot more stuff in it.  If you can afford it and if you have the storage space, a set like that will last you for years.  (I use a slightly higher-end version of the same brand in my kitchen.)  A collander or strainer.  I like the look of [this set](  for the variety of sizes and ease of cleaning.  You will need this for pasta and anything else that might need draining or straining.  A cutting board [or set of them](  because if you don't use a cutting board you won't be getting your security deposit back.You will need [a couple of potholders and kitchen towels] ( One good chef's knife.  I'm not including a link here, because I want you to go shopping at a store for this item.  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or a similar place is a good choice for this, but anywhere with a decent selection with a broad price range will do.   You will want to spend a little more money on this, maybe  30- 50, to get something that will last for awhile.  Look for an eight inch blade.  Pick the knife up, see how it feels in your hand, and take your time.  This is an important purchase.Next time, we'll get into stocking a basic pantry and refrigerator.\"}]"

And I feel like a lot of things are tied to a persons address. like ID, bills, voting registrations, etc. i’m also not paying rent here (they wouldn’t let me or want me to even if I was able to lol) so idk if I can be considered a resident here then. Idk if that matters for an address change. can I legally change my address to be my boyfriend’s and his parents’ address? If so, how? And if not, what should I be doing instead?Is it even necessary? Should I just rent out a P.O. Box and get my mail forwarded there? sorry if this makes no sense lol I’m really lost and idk how to figure out what to do but this seemed like a good place to ask.'"
