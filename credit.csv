51,What even is a credit card?,"What is APR? 
How do I get one? 
I want to improve my credit with using a credit card to pay necessary things such as my phone and World of Warcraft account. 
I understand interest, and I'm comfortable with paying interest on things I would usually pay from my bank account in turn for a smidgeon increase on my credit. 

What do you recommend for a first credit card? 
My bank is Chase and they're pretty stingy with their credit cards. 
They didn't even respond to my request for one."

149,Seeking Advice: Buying an Apartment in NYC,"I'm wary of the TL;DR factor so I'll be as quick as I can: I'm a first-time homebuyer. Currently renting in Manhattan. Good credit. Not exactly gainfully employed (I wait tables - I'd estimate my income to be about 3k monthly). Combined with my fiancée, 6k monthly. Her credit is ok but our minimal credit history is what I see as hindering. 

From what I understand and read, NYC apartments come in 2 flavors: condo and co-op. I'm 30 yrs old, not totally bent on ""settling down"" but I'm tired of paying a butt load of money for rent a month when I could theoretically pay less per mortgage if I bought. My other downfall is lack of down payment, but I hear that banks are willing to slash that for first time buyers. 

I should probably mention I don't have much debt - about 5k in credit cards that I'm paying down very aggressively. Not sure about fiancées student loans amounts but I know she is paying them off. 

Just looking for some insight from a broad range of experiences :) thank you very much! I will gladly respond to follow up questions to further my quest. "
201,What does Changing your USPS Address do? Is it Important to Do So?,"As the title suggests, I am moving back home after leaving my last job and I have been wondering if changing your address with USPS is actually important.  I have already changed the addresses with the places that need my address, but I haven't done it with the USPS.

The last time I changed it to my past address (now previous one), it appeared that the USPS handed/sold my information to mailing lists, resulting in a lot of spam that I honestly did not read nor cared for.  The other thing too, is that the website hates my credit card and I would have to find a way to get to my post office. 

Thanks!"
228,Wells Fargo v. Chase,"Hello! 

So I’m moving to California in August — please don’t try and dissuade me— but in order to do so I have to get through my to-do list. I currently bank with a local credit union, and my credit card is with Discover. When I move, however, I won’t be able to just hop on into a nearby branch to resolve issues. I’ve thought about it a lot, and I’m pretty sure I need to open a checking/savings account with a more national bank chain like Wells Fargo or Chase. Does anyone have any suggestions as to which is better? 

Please note that I’ll be 22 when I move, and the only credit I’ll have is from paying student loans/ my credit card. I don’t know if this impacts anything, but if it does it’d be good to know. 

Thanks in advance! "
250,How to convince controlling parents that I could do my own adulting,"This post may sound like me bragging, but I'm seriously really bothered by my parents trying to control my life, including my quality of life. I recently got an internship offer in DC, and will finally be making some real money in life. I was looking for housing for my internship period. I found a few good places on Craigslist and some school forums. They are cheap, they are decently located and I was gonna look into a few of them. Then my mom would jump out and try to ruin everything, forcing me to pick a place that's located in center DC, with private bath and everything, and unsurprisingly at a daunting $8000. I tried to convince her that this is way out of my budget range but she said that if I am not willing to pay for it she would just go ahead and book it for me. Being the only child I know a can be a spoiled brat sometimes but honestly I just really want to live my life as everyone else does, get a job, rent a somewhat shitty place and start saving money on my own. How do I avoid falling into the trap of being the type of girl who uses daddy's credit card? It seems like no matter how I insist my parents would just rather outright spend money for me even if I don't want them to..."
303,The value of making decision and not being afraid to own up to mistakes,"TLDR: each choice you make will have consequences. It’s better to take time and weigh the outcomes of the choices before making a final decision. 

Being upfront and honest especially about mistakes saves everyone involved time (maybe money as well)

So today after I saw on a Linkdin that a college classmate is an intern pro scout for the Arizona Coyotes, I relooked at decision I have made in my life

To fully understand the story we have to go back to grade 11 where I dropped U math (I’m Canadian) because I didn’t like the work I needed to put in (missed a shit load of grade 10 math class). This became the start of my terrible decisions and the reason for me to quit on things

Flash forward; I rushed into University (for business). Thinking of business class was cool in high school I love it. That was not the case. More research would have shown me that. Do to my parents putting an importance of school (both a blessing and a curse) I was terrified to tell them after the first semester I didn’t like it and wanted to leave. So I wasted both their money and my time doing another semester where I dropped 4/6 courses. 

That one year  would have been very different had I done 1 of 2 things: looked into school and realized I hate business or owned my mistake and talked to my parents about hating school after first semester

Over the summer I again I rushed into school. This time I go to school an hour away from my hometown (I go to school in Toronto for sports management). Honestly I am depressed. Having to leave to come back to my school house every Sunday at 7pm it’s a fucking sad thing. Just because I said “I didn’t like my first business program so a 3 year supply chain management program at the same school I did business at (legit 20 minutes from my house) would suck compared to sports management an hour away. 

This is just my school decisions but that I have learned is never ever rush a decision. If you have the option to take time and think about it. (Even an hour is a good amount of time) do it. Had I taken time I wouldn’t have spent a year wasting time and money or being depressed for 3 years as opposed to mediocre for 3 years. 

Now let’s talk financially and how IMPORTANT FINANCIAL LITERACY IS

so this started last year where towards the end of the school year I could only pay off part of credit card bill. All through September I knew I would need to work (at my dads factory) during the school year (not a fan of it, as we learned when I dropped grade 11 U math). So first semester goes by with me saying (everything will work out in the end. It always does). Ya it never does. Come winter break where I had to work 2 full weeks of my 4 week break and spent another week for surgery (fuck groin hernia). What was suppose to be a delightful relaxing break turned into the start of hell for me (thanks gambling problem). And it became worse as I replaced and spent $1300 (that I didn’t have and charged in to my credit card bill that will be due in Feb). So now I have the amazing opportunity to work 24 hours at my dads place (every week in Jan then 16 every week starting in Feb until the end of March) and with this work, I also get to do an unpaid 250 hour internship for school this semester (another 20 hours a week at a ski hill) then you get to factor in annoying group work and class. Oh what fun hell is. 

So the importance of financial decision is (at least for me) just because you can spend money on something you think you want (for me it was micro transactions is video games) doesn’t mean you should. 100% you are better off waiting some time to decide it it’s the best idea. 

So the importance of decision making. Take time to consider the positive of decision of the choices. Whatever choice you make will have an impact on your life, mostly likely one of the choices will be more negative than the other choice. 

As for the importance of owning your mistakes. It’s much better to be up front and honest and admit your mistake than you wait until it is forced out. You will save everyone involved time (and money)


Feel free to add the time I completely destroyed a great friendship of mine over jealousy on here to my list of regrets (I have). It started after my baseball game and she texted me about her new boyfriend (me being impulsive and irrational) replied with an offensive term (slut)! She got mad told me not to talk to her again. I waited a week. Her still being mad I dug the whole even deeper by being a huge not ok douche (I lied about being terminally ill) which work until I felt bad and came clean a week later. Making a small hole a larger hole. Then I did more stuff such as harass her (luckily she never pressed charges. Thank god!) and make this now large hole into a fucking colossal pit. (Btw this was when I was in grade 10, I’m now 4 year of college or 22 in 2019). I message her last year as I do every quarter to try and make admen’s she responded with “me being a complete psychopath and lying to her about everything. 


So if we chalk that friend situation on the decision making board. Waiting after my ball game before deciding how to respond to her texting me about her new bf would have definitely saved our friendship instead I made my decision immediately and have been paying the consequences of it ever since

316,22 y/o facing issues with finding housing,"Hi y'all, I couldn't think of a better subreddit to turn to about this than r/adulting so hopefully this is okay, haha;; this is kind of a long post so I'm sorry, it just requires some back story.

So I'm 22, with a boyfriend of 2.5 years, I have recently decided to go back to college to get my AA (and eventually my BA, but I'm going to community college to start), I'm working on getting a job that will work with my school schedule, and...

... I'm the youngest of three siblings so my mom has decided to baby the living hell out of me for years. My boyfriend and I live in the bottom part of her tri level home, rent free. My mom pays for my health insurance, car insurance, and gas, I take care of our phone bill, my credit cards (been working on building my credit the past couple years with no problems), mostly I take care of our food, outings, etc. So while I'm not too worried about eventually taking on the big bills, here's where things get dicey. 

I wouldn't exactly call my mom an alcoholic, but I know whenever she drinks (which happens in phases, she may drop it for a week or two then start again full force) she picks fights with me. The other night it happened again. I went upstairs to show her something cute I bought and somehow it blew up into this massive thing about, somehow, my boyfriend. But the subject is beside the point here, the point is that I'm sick of being afraid of my mother and her drinking. This last time I stood up for myself after being diplomatic didnt work and honestly, I was fully expecting to get slapped or even kicked out. I'm so tired of this endless cycle of her drinking, fighting, then sucking up to the point I'm ready to move out. My siblings have told me to move out since I turned 18 but I've been financially under my moms thumb.

I'm scared for my mental health and well being as well as the security in my place to stay. I have issues with my brainbits that make it hard for me to function sometimes, I know depression and anxiety are a component but in the coming months I'm going to seek treatment and get diagnosed. I've attempted suicide before and while I'm not looking for a way OUT but instead a way out of my parent's (thankfully that's the difference this time versus other times shes pulled stunts like this), I have a bit of another issue with just getting an apartment and moving tf out.

After high school I got a dog to be my unofficial ESA. His name is kodiak and he is the dumbest, sweetest creature on the face of the earth. Hes half rottweiler/half goldendoodle. Hes been an amazing emotional support animal, and once I seek treatment I plan on getting him fully established as my ESA from my therapist. But hes an ""aggressive breed"" which blacklists us from 95% of apartments around us. In addition, my boyfriend has a German shepherd of equally good nature. I've heard you can get two dogs registered as ESAs under one name and it removes the ability to discriminate on breed and weight, and while I have no problem vouching that the pup has helped me (I paid for her anyway, shes my boyfriend's in name only), I just don't know what power landlords can have when it comes to ESAs and the ability to find housing.

My goal is to move out by the end of the year, but my boyfriend thinks we should stay until I've gotten my associates. While I've dealt with my moms possible alcoholism for years, my desire for autonomy is really clashing. While I'm sure I could keep things copacetic enough to be able to stay until then, I really dont want to. I'd rather slowly work on my associates but be free (or face it full force head on while we look for places, then slow down).

Honestly, r/adulting, I just need some advice here.
A) given the backstory, is moving out wise? I cant change my mom, she refuses to believe alcohol has any affect on her and instead it's all my fault, so there's really no changing her behavior. Shes 63 and stubborn as a mule. My siblings have no leverage here either. So it's either move out or suck it up till I graduate, which should I do? 
B) if we decide to move out, what do I do with my dogs? Get both registered as ESAs? Does that even help?
C) call me scum of society if you want, but I fully plan on utilizing food stamps and my college's support systems for poor students if we need it. Are there any other reliable programs to help support us if we need them? I honestly dont know what's out there besides food stamps, if there even IS anything out there besides food stamps lol

Sorry for the long post, but any help is super appreciated.

352,Why would anyone ever have a credit card?,"This is not a troll question.

Misuse of credit cards lead to debt and you'd have to start caring about your credit card score and whether you're paying shit

But can't yoy just spend the money you have on your debit card? Maybe I'm just an ignorant kid but why would you go out of your way to use your credit card instead and accumulate that monthly debt?

I mean yeah when you need to buy a house or car or something and you don't have 300,000 dollars down payment in your debit account but what if you're just living on rent and don't really have to worry about that stuff?

Like why use your credit card to buy groceries?

Can someone explain this"
353,Why do my credit card applications get declined instantly?,"A little bit of a background to the situation:

I just turned 20 and I’m still living with my parents for the next year until I move in with my fiancé near the college that he’s attending for law and public policies. I work full time as a phlebotomist at the local hospital and I’m taking this year to try and save money and have some things ready for living on my own with him. I told my mom that- even though it’s scary and she swears off credit cards- I’d like to have some really good credit built up for the future and she eventually agreed that I should get a credit card and ONLY use it for gas and very minor purchases and pay it off immediately. I’ve had Credit Karma for awhile now and it says I have a credit score of 715, but I’ve tried applying for 2 different credit cards through the app over the last month or so and both were denied immediately.  I’ve only applied for 2 and I’ve spaced the applications out because I know each applications takes a few points from your credit score. The only reason I can imagine is because in the ‘Rent’ box, I put $0 because I’m still at home. I’m new to this, as stated, but can someone explain to me why or what I can do?"
529,"[Finance] I’m trying to get my first car. Looking for whether to save for longer, or get a loan.","To sum everything up, I make around $1700 a month usually from college benefits. I am a college student without a job at the current time. I just recently got my first secured credit card recently, so I am starting to establish credit.

In this time, I have saved around $500 for it. I know it’s a small amount but I have stupid spending habits due to a recent breakup and I need to stop.

After all bills, I would pay around $950 for everything. This closes down to my spotify sub. I usually get food for free from my college so that isn’t a problem.

I need a car for a couple of reasons.
A. Getting a job.
B. Landry.
C. Groceries
D. Eventually getting back into dating.

Should I wait? I want to get a loan and do this asap (from capital one, I’m not stupid) and this would help build my credit. If I wait, I would have a chance at not being able to get food for myself, this includes my cat.

Anyway reddit, I would like your opinion and inputs on how I should go about this :)"
538,In a month my grandfather and I will be co-signing on a car. Will that help me build credit?,"My grandparent's have exceptional credit, and with me moving at the beginning of 2020, they've agreed to co-sign on a car for me. I've done all the research and know what car I'm going to get and that I can afford the monthly bills.

However, while they have fantastic credit, I myself have none. Nothing bad, but nothing good either - just...nothing.

Will co-signing on the car and paying each bill help my credit score build, and (assuming I'm on time with every bill) be positive? I also intend to get a credit card once I move, and have someone willing to co-sign for that as well, but I figure the sooner I start building my credit the better."

698,Question: Building a “wider” credit portfolio,"Hi everyone, 

Up until recently, all I had was a $500 limit student VISA card through my credit union. This past weekend, I got it bumped up to $1000 and changed to a normal card, because I’m not a student anymore. 

When I was talking with the employee at my credit union, she warned me that though my credit score is excellent, my portfolio is “thin”. All I have in my credit history is that card. Even though I had that credit card for 3 years and always paid in full and on time, she said it wouldn’t really be substantial to a lender for, say, a mortgage. 

What I’m wondering is how I can make my portfolio wider with very little financial impact. I know I can do that with jewelry, so I may buy something small in the next few months. I’m reluctant to open up another credit card (something the credit union suggested) because I’m making decent income but not a whole lot, so I worry that that could have the opposite effect (plus she might have just been trying to sell me another credit card). Is there anything else I can do?"

850,Unsure about credit cards,"So Im a 22 year old in the military, without a clue on how banking works. I just opened an account with a different credit union. I have a joint savings account under my parents that I want to get rid of.

I have never even seen this card before. My parents are hard to get in contact with so Im not sure what to do with this knowledge. Do I press on with my new credit union and apply for a rewards card?

I'm pretty cautious about these things cuz it is like the ""real adult"" issues that can seriously harm you in the future or something. Thanks. I'm 19 and in college if that helps?"
865,Credit Score advice,"Hi all

So this time last year I got myself a credit card solely for the purpose of upping my credit score. I’ve had a phone contract for a good few years and started paying car insurance etc 2 years ago (I’ve been told they give you a credit history, yes?), and even though my mum’s always said “Never get a credit card!” I figured the extra boost wouldn’t hurt. I’m typically pretty good with money so haven’t had to use it very much, despite the fact the company gave me quite a bit of credit to play with 😅  
I’ve kept a pretty small balance (don’t think I’ve ever owed more than 25%) on the card for the year to keep the card “active”, occasionally paying off larger purchases immediately and always paying more than the minimum monthly payment.

The main pro of this particular card was the introductory rate of 0% interest, but that will be changing in roughly 3 weeks time, and I’m wondering what move to make.

On the one hand, close the card, but I believe that will negatively affect my credit score in some way? Correct me if I’m wrong.

Alternatively, I keep the card but Im not sure of the best way to use it? I can always use my debit card without a second thought as I’m in a good position financially for all my outgoings at the moment. Would it be beneficial to keep the card, making one purchase each month and paying it off immediately (which I assume means I don’t pay any interest? Sorry if I’m dumb haha) or is it fine to just keep the card and not use it unless for an emergency?

Frankly I just don’t want to be paying out more than I need to, and with my credit score being in the Excellent category on Experian now, I’m not concerned about getting that little boost anymore, but I also don’t want it to go down 😅

1367,I Want To Move Out.,"After I separated from my ex-wife last September, I had to move back in with my father for the second time in my life. I've also had to move back in with my mom once before. Aside from when I was married, I've only lived completely on my own once. All the other times it was with family or housemates. Now, it's been nearly a year and I haven't got shit to show for myself. I've been trying and failing to save up cash and pay off bills, but my depression and anxiety will have to take the blame for a few misguided purchases.

I have less than $10,000 of debt. I was able to pay off my car and get some things fixed on it, which did eat up some cash, however I still have loans and credit cards to rid myself of.

As mentioned, I'm struggling with depression and anxiety. Yes, I'm on meds and am seeing a psychologist, but I have no life outside of my job. I hate my job and I barely get enough sleep. I pretty much spend all my time alone and barely leave the apartment. I'm starting to feel more and more miserable. My confidence is shot to hell and I don't feel like a man who is almost 40.

It's by far time I move out, but as a wise man once said, ""The rent is too damn high!"" I make $13.35 an hour. We're working 50+ hours a week, so checks aren't too bad. Once the overtime ends, however, I will probably be at $2,100 a month. I don't want half my check going just to rent. I'm trying to figure out what I can manage, but I don't know what utilities will cost, let alone normal expenses. I was never good at finances and it's part of why I feel so helpless.

I've considered studio apartments, but I worry that getting one might make me look even more like a loser divorcee, not that any women are in my life. It's all a big pity party over here and I'm desperately trying to crawl out of this rut.

Any advice on figuring out money and is a studio apartment an direct ticket to Forever Alone land or a smart choice for someone hoping to one day move on with a special someone into a bigger home?

1432,Secure Credit Card and Building Credit.,"I am an Independent Contractor and my bank does not want to approve me for a normal credit card so I am going to put 500 down on a secure card. Could I build my credit on this card by buying a water at my schools vending machine on this card? I would be spending less than 10 dollars a week on this card but it would be active almost daily.

If i want to make a payment on it and pay it off every 2 weeks when i get paid will that be good for my credit score or bad?

1700,Buying a car!! (Without a co-signer¡¡),"So like the title suggests, I’m looking to buy a car without needing a co-signer. 

Long story short when I began this whole buying a car process, my father said he would co-sign for me and now he will not. The car I have now is 13 years old and losing value by the second; it’s been having issues (many issues) lately and I’d like to off load it before it costs more to fix it than the car itself is actually worth. 

I am a 21 year old college student with a part time job. I haven’t checked my credit score like ever (which I know is an essential part of getting a loan and all that jazz, I just don’t even know how), but I do have one credit card I pay off in full every month and a few other utility bills and an apartment lease in my name that have never been late. My net income is WAY under the cost of all my monthly expenses that are taken care of by my college fund, so I’m sure that will have an impact on me as a prospective lease candidate/my credit score itself. 

I know none of you are banks, so I don’t expect a hard yes or no as to if I can get a loan without a co-signer based on the information given, but does anyone have any tips on maybe how to make it more likely? I know large down payments can look good to banks when considering handing out loans and I have about 7,000 in savings right now I’d be willing to spend and IF I can sell my current car I might be able to add 2,000-3,000 more to that amount. 

This is my first actual, real venture into the adult world so any advice here is much appreciated. Thank you!"

1823,I recently graduated and moved to work full-time and have gotten out of my healthy eating habits. I am starting to get out of shape and want to nip it in the bud before it gets bad. Any advice?,"Note: I'm sure that a post like this already exists on this subreddit so I'm really sorry that this is probably a repost. I'm also new to reddit to please bear with me

When I went to college, I had a lot more time to cook healthily, my parents gave me grocery money, and my best friend was super into health and fitness so I had a lot of resources to be able to cook healthy meals and to eat regularly. However, about 4 months ago I moved to Seattle for a 40 hour a week internship which has now turned into a 40 hour a week job. The first 3 months I was making minimum wage so of course money was tight, given that I'm now paying rent in a big-ish, expensive city, especially on top of my car insurance, gas, utilities, credit card, etc. There were times when I had $20 in my bank account so I was literally living off of ramen and office snacks. 

Now that I got hired on, I'm making enough to actually grocery shop (which I love to do!). However, there's still the issue of time. I'm not a morning person, so there's the issue of having time to make a decent breakfast or pack a lunch. And then when I get home at the end of the day, I'm so tired (I've always been very lethargic) that I just resort to quick and convenient meals. It just sucks because I love to cook and I'm actually good at it, I'm just having trouble adjusting to the 9-to-5 lifestyle.

Does anyone have any tips for making time to cook, recipes, how to force myself to fit in some physical activity time, or really anything along the lines of get-your-shit-together-and-treat-your-body-well?"

Problem is with CreditOne bank. My credit is new and I'm having a hard time trying to get approved for a credit card. That's when Creditone sent me a mail with an offer. I'll post the pricing summary if anyone is interested ( https://i.imgur.com/yBCmNSOr.jpg ). I really wanted a credit card to start building my credit so I responded positively and today I got the card in the mail. I started reading the papers it came with and it has a 23.99 apr with interest being charged on day of posting date of transaction. No grace period. Now it's not that I want the grace period but I thought that you shouldn't pay interest on a card unless you're making late payments, am I correct on this? Thanks!"

1999,How do I get myself to do things?,"I want to do life stuff but I never learned how to control myself at all  and just skated k-12 on test scores and barely graduated highschool and got to JC and just couldn’t get myself to do anything And kept just giving up 


Then I got into a 3 year long relationship with a 30 year old that tried to use me and my parent’s Mooney to support himself, stole a ton from them and my inheritance 

And this is where it gets crazy. I was loosing my shit in the apartment that I was paying for about the above and the way he treated me then through lying to the cops he managed to get me arrested 

I had a really good case because I had a lawyer and this man had a decade of a criminal record but I was still dating him and he convinced me to not go to trail and take a misdemeanor against my lawyers judgement and then he proceeded to blackmail me for years. 

I only ended up breaking up with him because I hadn’t seen him for a month in the beginning of quarantine so he didn’t have much legally against me after not seeing him for so long he couldn’t just lie and then finally he got arrested and it turns out the whole god damn time he was stealing peoples credit cards and wound up in the papers arrested from stealing over 70000 in total 

Now when i called up my lawyer worried he’d try and frame me realizing that he had no heart and wasn’t just fucking up that he couldn’t care less about me but he basically said that because of the fact that my parents spent the last three years telling the police he was stealing from them only for them to do nothing that they can’t do much without looking stupid 

So anyway, talked to him one more time(or more like answered a phone call) and apparently he was just going to  some fancy rehab place for six months   

And it just sucks. He used a system meant to protect abuse victims to abuse and manipulate me and it’s fucking with me hard 

Which fuck I hate because it sounds like the kinda shit someone would say after abusing someone and shift the blame and don’t believe me if you want I probably wouldn’t but that’s what he did to me 

And now I have issues from trauma and ALL OF THESE FUCKING HEADACHES FROM THE CONCUSSIONS(I think). One of the saddest memories that made me cry to even say and still makes me cry  to even write when I asked him to hit me anywhere else besides my head because my brain is the only thing I have going for me 

And of course he just said he was never going to do that again but for a few weeks at least he was punching me on my head 

In fact the major thing that got me into this mess was when he threw me to the ground and tried to punch me and ended up breaking his hand. He told them (without me knowing) that I slammed his hand in a door and later used that to press charges and of course I wasn’t saying anything because I wanted to protect him  

Even though, it even said on his medical records that the sort of fracture he received was a boxers fracture and there’s no way that could have come from a slam but whatever you know how American cops are they just wanted to build a case against me 

So Holy fuck this was the only place I’ve ever recounted this whole story online this post was supposed to be about motivation because I’m 22 and need to get my life together my parents had me in their 40s and are just too old to really help me aside from monetarily and I just don’t know what to do my room is full of a lifetime of cluttter and distractions 

Anyways if anyone reads this I might manage to deal myself but i could use some positivity"

Then apply to fafsa and then community college, maybe even apply for food-stamps (don’t know how that works though tbh) and so far that’s all I have on my list, other than the usual “save up money to move out [eventually]” but I know that’s going to take a lot of time to get to that point.

My family is a little conservative on my mother's part and in general I don't talk about my private things to my parents since they just don't know how to express themselves (scream/overreact) or ask a lot of question (They want to many details). My family is difficult to manage and sometimes I have to do their paperwork or tell them what to do (adult things) and during the quarantine I realized that I cannot work remotely in the future or just take classes because they interrupt too much or they scream (to me or to each other) or complain that I am in the room all day (I like my privacy and everything is in my room, desk, computer, console, bed, ect), My family is always in an emotional or economic situation and they never manage to get out of it, the decisions they make sometimes have no logic.

My only assets are my car (Loan, $251/m paid in full by FEB 2022), 6k in savings and some stocks worth around $800.

Do I accelerate my plans to moveout or do I wait to earn more to leave more comfortable? any other advice?

I'm renting a basement room from a dude that has been reasonable and understanding, willing to work with me on a lot and I'm very grateful but I also share a home with 3 other people.

2239,Credit Card Pre-Approval?,"Hi, so I'm a college student!

A few years ago I started trying to build up my credit by getting a starter credit card with a $500 limit and cash rewards. I've been doing a really good job for like 3 years of making immediate payments! I still don't really know how credit cards work but I know that if I only spend what I can pay that's good, and use the credit-wise credit estimator to try to make smart decisions, too. 

I just got an email from my credit card company that I've been pre-approved for a new credit card. It has no annual fee, 1.5% cashback, low introductory APR, etc, but doesn't tell me how much money is on there? My question is, isn't it bad to have too many credit cards? So would accepting this ""great opportunity"" actually worsen my credit score? At this point in my life, I'm not even sure that I w*ant* another credit card. I'm just wary of this email because it seems a little scammy like ""take this offer now, or you'll miss out!"" and I want to make sure I'm making the right decision to accept the offer or miss out on it.

Thank you :)"
2264,"Trying to climb out of my debt, unemployed, and no health insurance (25M)","I am 25 years old, back at my parents, in debt, and unemployed. I have been unemployed for about 6 months now. I was working in the insurance industry as an underwriter assistant. The place I worked for was horrible place to work at. The systems were so old, that they literally couldn't handle the amount of volume the business was bringing in. Anyways, when COVID hit things just got worse. They let go of people so that they could secure the PPE loans. Increasing my work load when I was already working weekends. Mind you, I was working every weekend. Another important fact was that i was making $14 an hour. As my workload began increasing, I found out that two coworkers got paid more than me. One made $17 an hour, and the other $15 an hour. The one making $15 an hour also got a quarterly bonus of $1500. This just infuriated me. Neither of these people had as much experience in the industry as I had. (I have been a licensed insurance agent and then my time as an underwriter assistant at this company) Although I didn't have any formal education past my high school diploma, neither did they. In any case, COVID made its way to where I lived and the company handled it horribly. There was an outbreak at work. Employees still had to come in. So I decided to quit. I am fortunate that my parents can help feed me and provide a roof over my head. This being said, I have over $6,000 of credit card debt and no job after 100+ applications. In addition, my parents are foreign and have French health insurance which means I can't get on their plan.

2296,References for buying a house,"Hello!

For background, I am 23, and looking to buy a house some time after I graduate and start a full time job in January. I have no clue where to begin; I've read that 20% would be enough for a down payment on a house, but I've heard from older friends that they've put down 5% and been fine, since in their opinion, 20% is a little bit less realistic. 

I *could* save for 20% on a house, but it would take about 10-11 months, to over a year, with maximum saving towards the house. But aside from this, what are some specifics? Do I really need a realtor? I've had a credit card for about a year and a half, and have maintained good credit; will this help, especially given that I'll be able to buy the house basically in another year?

I appreciate any advice, links, or references to any resources that can help! Thank you in advance :)"

So far so good right?

Except I feel like I'm always on the verge of losing my *ish*.. 
This year particularly had been chaotic for me: In November of last year I quit my job of 15 years, for a part-time position at half the pay. Completely different field of work of which I knew next to nothing about.

In my 1st month on my job I had to research &amp; set up health &amp; dental insurance benefits for the 9 employees in the small business.

I had to clean up bad reconciliation records for the bank &amp; credit card accounts in QuickBooks.

I had to plan for both of their funeral services... All while planning a 25-year surprise anniversary party for my sister &amp; her husband &amp; planning a family trip to New York (13 people)..

When I first got it I logged in online and saw that I had an ""available credit"" limit of 5000$. This shocked me and I was not expecting it to be that high. I thought my limit would be 1000$ at the most. I have no previous credit experience but have had a debit card since I was 14ish.

Anyways, I'm kind of confused because in the few days or so that I've had it I've put about 500$ (probably not the best idea?) on it but my available credit dropped to 3500$. I have a 500$ medical surgery that I NEED to get in a few days and I was relying on my credit card to pay for it until I get paid next week.

3045,I got a credit card. Adulting progress.,"I’m a college sophomore, paying for pretty much everything except tuition and housing. 

Apparently a credit card is something adults are supposed to have. So I have one now. Just thought I’d share this adulting step/success. 

Due to more expenses than usual and less hours at my part time job, money’s been tight this month. I blew through my limited savings and need to get my car registered in my new state, as well as renew my license. 

Figured it’s time to handle being low on cash like a real sort of responsible adult rather and get a credit card rather than asking my parents or equally broke friends to lend me the cash. My plan is to only use it for gas (a fairly large expense, which I budget for and would be buying anyway) and emergencies. 

It shouldn’t cause too much trouble; it’s got a $500 limit and I don’t even want to use it more than necessary. I’m not thrilled about knowing I’ll be charging $100+ so soon after getting it. But it should be payed quickly, I just got a second job and things will be picking up soon at my first one. Fingers crossed here."
3071,My mom is going to beg me for money again.,"Since my parents’ divorce when I was 14, my mom has relied on my sister and I for money.  Now that my sister works and lives on her own (very low income), my mom doesn’t bother her for money because she can’t spare much.  Once or twice a year she comes to me.  

At the moment, my mom (59) tells me she has -1200 USD in her checking account, because she didn’t have enough for her automatic house payment, and close to half of the 2300 she brings home per month goes to paying off payday loans.  Her electricity was supposed to be turned off last week, but it was extended to the 23rd - she can’t pay it.  She was supposed to use her car as collateral on a $700 payday loan to get her through, but I had to drive her from work yesterday because her cat broke down.

This has been over half my life.  She has such problems.  She can’t manage her money, and her boyfriend (45) of 3 years is unemployed and sits around in her house all day, she doesn’t make him work or anything.  It’s insane. 

I’m 25, in grad school, in a really nice full time job with great benefits.  I am financially healthy for the first time in my adult life.  My student loan refund comes through next week, and my mom knows it.  I have told her for months now that I need every dollar and cannot give her any.  She already asked me last week - I was open that the answer would be no.  She acted offended that I “didn’t even want to talk about it.”  I said she could say what she had to say but the answer would be no.

I’ll keep saying no.

I have been saving money and slowly furnishing my new apartment.  It’s been so great living on my own, away from my family with their problems.  My mom will not fuck this up for me, I’ve worked to hard.

She will ask again, it’s coming.  I have had trouble with her before trying to apply for credit cards with my SSN and info, I have to be on the watch for things like that as well (I’ve told her, next time I’ll pursue legal action and I don’t care that she’s my mom).

Granted, this comes from the fact that I have a privileged lifestyle.. I’m from an upper middle class family in a third world country (PH) and I have a stable job, as well as stable income from our family business and a sustainable amount of money from my dad’s passing. 

I’m 23 and I’m finding that everyone around me has a credit card. 

When I was in my teens I used to have a postpaid line for my cellular device, but because of excessive charging and the pressure of constantly paying for them or fighting not to, I’ve since stopped anything that would tie me to such companies financially. I lumped in having a credit card under such companies (in this case, banks) due to my mistrust for those big corporations.

Anyway, is it naive or stupid for me to think that I wouldn’t need a credit card? And if I really would need one down the line, would it be better to get one ASAP to rack up my credit score/rewards/points?

Sorry for the dumb question lol but thanks in advance for any help."
3148,Screwed before I even got started,"So I’m 23, have no debt, no credit cards, have no loans/mortgages or anything like that (nor have I ever), and I saved up and paid cash for my car so I own that outright. I recently started looking into building credit finally and found that my score is.... 552. I was on my moms insurance while I was in college and any medical bills went to her (very very lucky, I know) but she has always been super horrible at keeping up with that stuff (my dad took care of it before he died) so she never paid on time, lots of stuff went to collections, yada yada yada. I didn’t realize there was even an issue on my end until I looked at my credit score. I never learned about any of this stuff growing up so I thought that as long as it got paid, it went away. I have done nothing myself to get either good or bad credit, but since my credit score is so low thanks to those bills, I will have a hard time getting a credit card to even START working on it. That all said, my question is: where DO I start?"
3162,Young adult here. I think I messed up.,"So last night I was looking on ordering something off of a website. So I proceeded to go to checkout and buy it. But when I did it told me something was up with my card info or postal code and told me to check my profile. So I did and realized I put in the wrong billing address. I recently got a new credit card and my dumbass but in the old address. So now I'm freaking out I would've thought they would've rejected it but when I check my bank account they took out the 80 dollars. Without sending a email, payment, order confirmation. So I check under purchased iteams and nothing is there. I sent them a email (since they have no customer service number) and tried to just cancel my order and get my money back. Is it likely that I will get my money back."
3283,How do I pick a decent credit card if I have no credit history?,"So I'm 19 and in the Army and I want to start building my credit score but my parents are anti-credit cards so I have nowhere else to go for help. (I tried googling this but all the answers talk to me as if I understand everything already... I don't even know what APR is...) How do I choose the best credit card for me? Especially if I have no credit history? And what is a good ""APR"" for someone just starting out?"
3345,Adulting Checklist Ideas,"I’m making myself and excel spreadsheet with adult things I have to remember to do every month, 3 months, 6 months, and yearly. Here’s what I have so far, and I am looking for any other suggestions: 


Monthly:
Pay credit cards 
Pay bills 

Three months: 
Oil change

Six months:
Insurance 

Yearly:
Taxes (when, what I need, receipts to save)
License plate and tabs 
Registration"
3383,Do we need a co-signer?,"Me, my sister, her boyfriend, my boyfriend are all wanting to split rent on an $1,800 house. Our combined income is $7,200. My boyfriend got his credit card in July and has been building it well: paying off weekly, using it well, etc, etc. I know it takes around 3-6 months to generate a score though. Do we still need a co-signer?"
3461,Credit Card Remorse,"A couple weeks ago I decided to finally sign up for my first credit card (Petal). I confess that I didn’t know much about the company and was only choosing them because my dad had said they were a good place to start building credit with. Well, stupidly enough I decided to trust his judgement thinking he’d done his research and made an account... But now after reading reviews after reviews as well as all the horror stories on Twitter, Reddit, Facebook, and NerdWallet, I’m feeling some major regret and panic.

I’ve received my card since, but left it unactivated. What should I do? Call and close the account? Take the risk? Or since there allegedly isn’t any fees, just don’t use the card and leave it in my safe?"
3511,"Constantly anxious about bills but financially stable, any advice?","I am a 21 year old massage therapist whose been working at a spa for about nine months now. I make about $1500 a paycheck plus plenty of cash tips but am working extra hours to build my savings (should have $7000 when I move), which I can't continue indefinitely due to the joint pain from overwork. My only debt is a car payment and my current job pays as little as possible for massage therapy. I didn't have a car when I started so had to pick it based on proximity to my house--I can reasonably expect to make slightly higher pay at any place I work since most nationwide massage chains pay slightly more. I expect about $1200 paychecks at the lowest plus cash tips and that is what I want to budget around since I would rather be too pessimistic than mess up my finances majorly.

I currently live with parents but am moving to the city I went to college in beginning August when my best friends lease is up. We've found an absolutely wonderful apartment that's everything I've ever dreamed of where rent would be about $1400 a month after utilities, parking, all that stuff. I know that I'm in an overall okay financial position but I'm terrified I won't be able to afford rent. My car insurance is currently $195 a month living in the suburbs and my car payment is about the same, so I have approximately $400 in bills in addition to rent so nothing crazy considering I have no pets, children or credit card debt but I am stressed constantly that I won't be able to afford my rent or that I'll have difficulty finding a job or that I'll get into a car accident and be unable to work. This anxiety is seriously impacting my life and I haven't even moved out yet. I have to pull over while driving sometimes to double check my budget just in case I made a mistake and I actually can't afford something. I don't want to give up on our dream apartment because of unreasonably anxiety but part of me feels like its foolish to consider renting anything that isn't the absolute cheapest hole in the ground I can find. 

I guess I don't feel like a real adult and I constantly feel like if I so much as blink I'll make a horrible financial mistake and be ruined and touring apartments has really made me even more worried that something out of my control will happen. Does anyone have advice? 

&amp;#x200B;

tldr: Okay job, good financial background, about to move out and overwhelmingly terrified of not making rent for no real reason"
3515,Finding my first Apartment. Am I missing something?,"So I live n a major city, I make decent money and by the end of the year, I plan on getting rid of two of my 3 ongoing financial debts (a loan and my credit card leaving only mr car payments to be quickly paid off). 

Anyway,I’ve kinda been looking to get my 1st apartment (1br, 1bath hopefully) and it’s very confusing. 

A place I’m looking into has a 1bed, for $885 but a two bed for $445. 

Is... is there something I’m missing here. I’m also seeing another place that has a 1bed for $375 but that’s just seems to good to be true. 

In the home hunting field, is there something I should be aware of when making these kinds of choices? I’m very new to being an adult."
3517,College Student Living at home with bills,"A little bit of a backstory.. I began working in high school and have had a job every since. I was making pretty good money at one point after graduating HS but was only going to College part time specifically so I could work. During this time i got a phone bill and a gas credit card to start my credit. I then was forced to get a used car due to my old one crapping out. At the time I was able to pay for everything. 
I got my Associates Degree and transferred to a University and it became a whole new ballgame. I realized that I should have been focusing on college instead of a good paying job when I was right out of HS. I’m now going to school full time and working part time. I’m also struggling with a new diagnosis that has been difficult to get used to and rearrange my life around. 

With all that being said, I’m now full time college student, part time job, absolutely tons of hw. 
I no longer make enough to cover all 3 of my bills and one has already been sent to collections. My parents have been helping me out and I have been doing tons of chores in return. They just told me today that they aren’t helping me anymore without any explanation. 

What they aren’t realizing is that my life is flip flopped and I’m having to live out the years that should have been right out of HS with no money, later on down the line. If any of my other bills are sent to collections my credit is done for. That means I won’t be out of their house for an even longer amount of time. It is kind of setting me up for failure in a way.. 

Don’t get me wrong, I am BEYOND grateful for everything they’ve done for me and provided me but I feel like they’re deserting me during a critical time in my life. 

What resources or information or points can I provide them to maybe get them to understand the situation I’m in and that would be created if they cut me off? For example, how can I show them calculations of the cost of living, credit scores needed, my current income and how I pay almost all of my check towards one of the bills each pay day? 

Thanks for your help!"
3547,Just got approved for a debt consolidation loan!,"I'm very relieved and surprised at the same time. I resisted this for a while because I believed it was ""taking the easy way out"" or ""doing it wrong"" and I should be toiling away and throwing every extra cent at my debt. But when I sat down yesterday and wrote out my credit card balances and averaged my interest rates...well my average interest rate was 26% and I was like...I could do better almost anywhere else. 

I am still no money expert, but if you're reading this post and have considered doing the same thing...here's what helped me go in this direction:

\-The cards I'm consolidating are cards I haven't used in a long time anyway and don't plan on using once I use the loan to pay the cards off. I plan on keeping 1-2 cards open for emergencies, but I didn't include those cards in the consolidation. The total balances on the remaining cards will make paying them off more manageable. If you're like me and are somewhat impulsive, be sure you have a plan and are willing to make sacrifices in the future to not run up the debt again. I used YNAB this month and already got a sense of what I don't need and could cut back on. I also have a seasonal side job starting in the next month and a half to help with extra money, and I also plan to cut back on my cell phone bill. (My biggest victory was spending nearly $100 less on going out to eat, and I also cut almost $50 worth of subscriptions.) From now on, I'm going to ""act my wage"" as Dave Ramsey says. 

\-I decided not to be afraid to not take the first loan offer I got. I used all the sites you've probably seen on Facebook ads (Lending Club, Lending Tree, Marcus by Goldman Sachs), but ultimately opted to apply with a local branch of my bank. 

\-By consolidating, I'll go from making six different payments at multiple times of the month to making one payment on that loan. It relieves some of the pressure for me. So overall, I'm going from nine monthly payments on debt to three (personal loan, student loan, two credit cards I'm keeping open). 

Final disclaimer: I don't work for my bank or any lending company, or even in finance at all. Just wanted to help anyone else who might read this and be feeling stressed about debt."
3551,I feel peaceful.,"Yesterday I cleaned out my rabbits outdoor pen and got rid of the hutch from my bunny who passed away recently. It took 2 hours and was very emotional, but it felt good to get it done.

Today I got paid so I paid two credit card Bill's, ordered a new hutch for my remaining bunny and paid off one of my hospital bills entirely. I also cleaned out my chicken's hutch and aired out the house to let in some fresh early spring air.

I still have a lot to do to clean up my life after a really long depression slump (about 3 years, not counting sporadic moments). But for now I'm relaxing, having a hard seltzer and enjoying a home cooked meal with some comedy shows on youtube.

Things have been difficult, but for now life is looking good."
3580,Can someone explain to me how Annual Percentage Rates work when buying a car?,"I am buying my first car and have heard of APRs. What exactly is it and how is this calculated when buying a car?

In addition, while it wasn't mentioned in the title can someone explain how it also relates to credit cards? Is it roughly the same concept? How do they differ?"
3596,Advice for getting first apartment?,"My boyfriend (25M) and I (20F) have discussed getting an apartment together, most likely by spring 2020.  We decided on that because I’m graduating college in December 2019 right before my 21st birthday and I would like to be 21, have access to all of my savings accounts and whatnot, and be done with my undergrad before moving out. I’ll be graduating with ~9k in debt which I have been paying off little by little while I’m still enrolled- since I wanted to get it down as low as possible before finishing. My grace period before I need to pay it off is December 2020. 


I like to think that I’m financially intelligent regarding stuff like this but I’m not exactly sure of what steps need to be taken before renting an apartment. I recently found out that one needs to have good credit, so I intend to open a credit card with my bank soon. My boyfriend and I usually pay with either debit or cash for everything. Are there any other things I should keep in mind? Thank you :)"
3608,Not Sure About Selling Home,"I could really use some advice I dont want to make poor life choices but, the reasons leading me up to want to sell is after 2 years my home has increased in value which would give me a small profit of 35k and after talking it over with my realtor including closing costs, debts I owe on credit cards, and including other costs like down deposit, four point inspection, deposit, and appraisal for for my home and the property I'm interested in buying. That alone had my head spinning but they would include it all in closing costs leaving me with roughly 22k to walk away with after selling this current home and the same day buying and moving into the home I'm interested in.

My realtor did a walk through my home and told me what fixes to make and so I began working on projects, clearing out rooms, put most of my furniture in a storage unit and then find out the lender can't get me approved for the home loan. I was shocked because my credit is good but apparently my 5 maxed out credit cards and bank loan make me appear as a risk or liability despite the credit. My lender who has an underwriter did various scenarios when they finally found a solution.

If  I sell my home and afterwards temporarily rent a place for 3 months my credit score will reflect 5 paid off credit cards and a paid off bank loan which should increase the score enough to have an approval. This at first seemed appealing but now I'm thinking ""not smart"" since its not a guarantee that would actually happen. So, I'm between a rock and a hard place now. Really unsure about my future choices for selling this home.

What would you do in this scenario?"
3642,Can you pay the down payment and initial rent for an apartment with a credit card?,"I found my first job and moving across country. Unfortunately they are not paying for relocation fees and I have only ~1000$ in cash savings. Fortunately though I have excellent credit and have a good amount in my credit limits in my cards to be able to spend for logistics expenses that I figure I can pay off immediately once I get my first paychecks in.

Would a bigger sized rental company allow me to put a down payment and first and last months rent on a credit card since that money is technically not mine? I figured my credit score tells them I am a trustworthy borrower and I always follow up with my payments"
3649,A gay that might Move out of parents house. Need to make a decision,"I’m a 23 y.o and live with my parents. In our foreign household it is very normal for children to stay with parents until married. Sometimes the youngest boy will actually take over the bills and live with the parents, while having kids and building his own life, while taking care of his parents as well(which I respect) however....I’m a gay female and my parents aren’t happy with it, but we stay civil and we all still love each other, but I feel uncomfortable when we have company over bc my parents asked me to keep my sexuality to myself and not tell our community, and it’s all okay but deep down I’m not very happy, and I feel like a fool that’s living a lie. I’ve respected their wishes thus far) However, I have a great desire to move out and have the freedom to creat a life of my own and have my own friends and build a social life outside of my community. At the same time, my highest level of education is High school diploma with about 16.5 earned college credits. I currently work at a hospital full time making a little over $14 an hour. MY monthly expenses are my car $310.14, my phone $95.50 , one credit card $28(minimum), my music app $10,  gas approx. $160. I have a emergency credit card with $500 credit on it that I only use when abso needed(which hasn’t happened yet) if I moved out. I would have to work full time 36-40 hrs a week AND Ive decided to go back to school (Pursing nursing at a community college) bc I have no future without an education. I AM STUCK ON DECIDING to stay home and finish school(even tho Ive grown out of my parents) so I can save money( for the future and be more finically prepared and stable by the time I graduate) and not have the pressure of paying rent and meals while studying hard to finish my degree. OR moving out, having independence, freedom, growth, opportunity but having less financial freedom, less money to travel, less money to save. Stress of paying more bills/working while studying to gain a better future for myself. I feel like I’m battling between my heart and what’s logical. 

Is it as hard as I think it is to work and go to school while living without parents financial help?

Should I follow my heart or be logical ?

Thought/opinions/experiences?? 

Please and thank you.

3654,How to start building credit,"As a 19 year old I want to start building my credit. I bought a car two months ago so I have car payments every month, so I know that is helping with my credit. I have been thinking about getting a secured credit card. Is that a good idea? Should I wait a little longer to apply for one since my credit took a hit from checking it for my car loan. And what is the best way to use it? Like I head only use 10% of the spending limit and pay it off ASAP, but I also heard spend close to the filly amount and pay it off ASAP too. So that’s a big difference. Any advice and what and what not to do?"
3677,Parents have been using my bank account to check up on me,"Hi all,

I'm (24F) staying with my parents during this quarantine and it feels weird to be back home for such a long time. I am very independent from them, I moved out at 18. We have a complicated story but I choose to never depend on them for anything, they always make me feel guilty if I do. Even if I'd ask for donuts, it would be this weird feeling of wow I better be grateful. My dad wanted me to come back home for the quarantine because he was worried I wouldn't have money for groceries or if I got sick who would take care of me kinda thing. I live in a completely different state and was like yeah that's true, I don't want to have to depend on my boyfriend of 1 year and my few friends. All of my savings had been depleted due to my depression and lack of motivation. Lol right before this (Covid-19) all started I did finally get a job and I got to work there for two weeks before the restaurant closed down. ANYWAYSSSS getting to the point, I'm low on money and I like to have privacy when it comes to my finances. Privacy in general, and my parents have always been really nosy, tracked me on my phone when I was younger, etc.. And my dad kept asking me recently how much money I had in my bank account and well I didn't want to tell him. I told him it was none of his business. Today he's like, I bet you have \_\_\_\_ money in your account and I was like wow that's really close and I was like nopeeee don't worry about it, you have no idea. Next thing I know he pulls up my bank account on his computer. He has been checking up on me this entire time! I was like wow that's an invasion of privacy, I only gave my mom access when I initially started it years ago for emergencies. I had absolutely no idea that he had access or that they could do that. I was pissed. Then he gets mad and is like I don't see the big deal, it puts me at ease knowing how you're doing. How would you feel? I got really mad, because then I was like, how do I know you aren't going through my messages because you are concerned about my relationship with my boyfriend and reading everything. He got super mad and was like now you're making stuff up and walked away. I just always feel like he ignores my feelings and get disrespected. He doesn't see it and says I shouldn't have these hard feelings...

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Dad has had access to my bank account for years and has been checking up on me this entire time. To be fair I recently got a credit card and now the transactions are only my subscriptions. 

How would you feel? My parents don't think it's a big deal, but I do..."

3767,Opened my first credit card recently. I have some questions,"Before I got my card, my father and I went to the bank and we were talking with this lady who helped us though the process. I had originally went there to cash in a check but I didn’t have a bank account yet. 

Anyways I have my card and it says my total credit line is $500. Is that a monthly thing or in total? Reason I’m asking is because I was told that if I spent 1000 in the first 90 days, I would get a $200 cash rewards bonus. My father wanted to do this and I was on board because I don’t really know anything. 

Now I remember I was told from someone else it’s best not to max out your credit card and to only spend about 30%  or less of your available credit. Obviously spending 1000 will be way more than 30% 

So what do I do? Also how do you pay off your credit cards? Is it through your bank? I already spent $55 so far."

3848,I really need help understanding my credit card,"I'm 19. My parents don't know much about credit and have only used debit. I opened a line of credit to prepare for getting an apartment and loans in the future. Right now my debit card is unable to work due to what I think is a manufacturing error so I've only been using my credit card. The balance on my card reads (numbers slightly edited for simplicity) 250. But my limit is 500. I thought this meant that i had 250 left available to spend until I made another payment. However, I unexpectedly got declined today and was surprised. I went home and checked my statement and I was out of credit. But the report still read 250 balance. What does the balance mean if not how much you owe the credit card company? So I paid 250. But it didnt change the balance. So I paid 250 again. With the actual numbers this would put me over 500 available credit, and my summary reflected a perfect 500 in credit. But the balance is unchanged (payments update automatically with my bank). Can someone help me figure out what is going on here? And also where that extra money went because I definitely paid more than 500 credit and I dont see the extra (60 something dollars in actuality) money anywhere on my account. It just disappeared.

4217,I turn 22 today and I feel so lost.,"I know 22 isn’t a big number, but it just hit me that there’s no “age” to look forward to anymore. 

I’m about to graduate college and still feel like I lack this fiery passion that many young people have. I’m set to apply to grad school and am terrified, because grad student loans will make me feel officially like an adult. I let myself gain SO much weight from the relationship I’m in, and I’ve avoided seeing people (also due to the pandemic) simply because I don’t have energy or feel unattractive. I’ve lost energy for new friendships even though I used to be very sociable. 

I have a choice to move to a new state with my sister next year and land something related to my undergraduate degree. The thought of leaving my life behind and heading off to California terrifies me. Cause then it’ll feel real. 5 years ago, I would’ve jumped at the chance to move. But the older I get, the more I wanna stay in one place and embrace my routine for some reason.

I’m disappointed I’m not where I envisioned my older self to be. I thought I’d be madly in love with my girlfriend after a year, but it seems the opposite and I feel like time is wasted. I don’t know when shit will get REALLY real in life, but right now I’m just terrified for the future. I’m terrified for changes because it’ll make me “feel old”. I guess I’m just missing my childhood (like no car payments, credit card payments, paying for my own food). I hope it gets easier!"
4263,Moving cross country-do I need a credit card?,"Basically what the title says.  I'm with a Credit Union right now and I'm guessing I need to cancel my account before leaving town (?).  I have a credit card for my car but it's specific to a regional car repair place, I don't have one for extra expenses/if needed kind of stuff.  I have just over 3k in my savings and not sure how to pay for things on the way out to the new town before I have another bank account--is it best just to use cash or should I take out a credit card/if I did that is it going to be an issue if I'm canceling my credit union account and moving?"

4290,I got pre-qualified to buy a house!!,"I’m so freakin happy!!!!! This is something I thought I’d never accomplish, but here I am, 29 years old, about to start the home buying process. 

I’ll give you a brief backstory, so you understand why this is a huge deal for me. 

I come from poverty and rampant drug abuse. A truly dysfunctional family. My mom kicked me out when I was 18, and I promptly lost my job at the gym 2 weeks after signing my first apartment lease. As a student, I had limited availability to work, but I put my mind to it and went job hunting every single day. Ultimately I was hired at a retail job that I loved. 

Over the following seven years, I racked up (and paid off. And racked up again. And paid off again) tons of stupid credit card debt. I was duped into buying a used car with an outrageous interest rate and then made the situation worse by trading up for a better car. I was massively upside down. My car payments are still $400+. I’m glad to say I’ll own that car free and clear within the next 2 years. 

I’ve been in and out of apartments my whole life. Often with a boyfriend or a friend. And it often failed. Not that I can’t live with other people... but I have standards for my home. And so many people violated those standards (smoking in the house! Never washing dishes, etc). 

I have not finished my education, but I have amassed $20k+ in student loans. Those cost me $250/mo. Between rent, loans, insurance, and other lines of credit I’m whittling down, plus bills and the gym, the doctor and physical therapy, and groceries, gas and entertainment ...... it’s been a lot. I also care for my little sister in a few ways, like taking care of her phone bill. I have made every effort to make payments on time and more than the minimum when i can. Bonuses go to debts. I have a little cash savings and my 401(k) is looking really good. 

I work my ass off. As a flight attendant, I can work nearly as much as I want, and it’s been great! It’s a costly career. I often MUST buy things out of convenience or replace my luggage and uniforms. But I am making it all work. 

I tell you allllllll this to say: you CAN do it! Your past will not define your future. Be brave and make things happen. "
4421,Car buying PROCESS????,"Hey all! 19/f and it's my first time buying a car. 

TLDR; Don't understand what the ""process"" (eg paperwork, applications, financing etc) is for buying a car.

    I've tried looking at guides online but nothing seems to be very helpful for what I'm asking specifically. I' super lost on the PROCESS of buying a car. Not the ""what car do I want,"" just the ""how to go and get it."" I don't have a reliable adult in my life to walk me through these steps (I hang out in r/raisedbynarcassists ), and feel so so lost.


Background info:

   I have a few models I'm interested in (Honda fit, kia rio, volkswagon golf, hyundai accent etc... all hatchbacks-- used/CPO of course. Looking for something simple, reliable, and lots of seat-foldy cargo space for if I ever have to live in my car.) I have a downpayment (2k) right now but am interested in financing. I have Bank of America account as well as a discover credit card, and I'm on my parents insurance (USAA)- I'd like to make sure everything is under my name though. My credit is pretty good (699 last I checked) but also very new- I opened my first card two months ago. Not sure what other information I can give but I probably have it I think! 

Questions:
- How does financing a car work? Can I do it with such a new credit history? 

- What is the actual process of buying a car?! Who do I call, what website do I go to, how do I not get completely ripped off as a first time buyer?



Please, someone help?! 😥"
4479,When Do I Pay My Credit Card Balance,"I feel really stupid for having to ask but I don’t want to mess this up. I’m 21, I have ehh credit. I got a credit card! $200 down for a $200 credit line, credit karma recommended it for me. OpenSky if it matters. 

So I’m only using it for a couple small bills (netflix, spotify) and not touching it otherwise, I intend to pay the balance in full monthly. But here’s the thing.

The app I have with the company says that I made some purchases, and paid the start up fee, totaling about $67. But where it says “minimum payment due” it says $0. And there’s no date listed for when payments are due. 

I’ve had the card for about 2/3 weeks now, I want to pay it on time but I also don’t want to pay too early? If that’s a thing? I want it to report on my credit that I used it and paid it. 

TL;DR: When do I pay my credit card balance if I’m not being given a minimum payment/payment due date? 

Also my apologies for formatting etc. im on mobile and I don’t use reddit often."
4496,Credit card help?,"Hey all! 
I am currently wrapping up college, and have avoided getting a credit card this far. But I can’t go into the world with no credit, and with that said I’ve been applying to different cards. I’ve tried discover, capital one, and so many more. I’ve tried regular and student and they all decline me. I have a steady part time job, never am late with rent, and my credit isn’t bad at all.

I recently got bit by a dog and went to the clinic and I needed to pay $200 immediately because I have no insurance. I didn't have those $200 on hand so I used my credit card.

4657,"Can't decide on a bank, I haven't gotten my drivers license yet, and no idea how to get a car. Please help.","I want to preface this by I'm 18 and I don't have a great idea of how things work or what to do. I'm from Indiana.

I've been trying to get a bank account with Chime but have hit some bumps, it's fine, but it's causing me to think about other banks. I don't really know what to do? I've been told go with a bank with no fees (that's only online ones), go with a physical one, go with a local one, etc.

I was advised to look into getting a credit card so I could build up my score to getting a better deal on financing a car, Chime doesn't offer that yet.

I've been considering/pointed to Chase, Ally, CapitalOne and a credit union. Any seasoned advice is appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

I have no idea how to drive a car, and I don't have my license either. I know, not having a license at 18 is weird.

I was planning on paying a driving school in my town $300 for classes, but...I don't know anymore. I brought it up to my boss and she said she'd look into finding someone to teach me, that was 2 weeks ago. I don't want to bug her about mentioning she'd try to find someone, so I'm trying to figure this myself.

How should I learn? Should I ask a friend? (My parents aren't options, my mom refuses to and to let my dad, and he's awful at driving tbh)

Should I pay for the classes? I don't believe they have physical classes in December and I'm too late for signing up for classes this month, the first class of this month was today.

I don't know how soon I'd be able to get my license, I read some things saying I'll need to have a permit for 120 days or have 50 hours of supervised driving, I don't know what it relates to or if it applies to me since I'm 18.

I've heard about videos on youtube, but I probably need more education beyond that.

&amp;#x200B;

My third new-to-adulthood problem, I don't know how to get a car exactly. I have my mind set on getting a pre-owned Toyota from a dealership, I'm saving up for a downpayment, but...I don't know what to do once I get enough. Or what it requires, please tell I'm wrong thinking I'll need a parent to co-sign? I know neither of them will if I have to. Can I have someone else co-sign?

How can I get a good deal with financing? That leads back to building up a credit score, a friend of mine told me he got to have his brother sign cause he's got a pretty good score. 

How the hell do I pick an insurance company that won't hate me cause I'm 18?

I've been losing my mind thinking about all this the past few days, I'd appreciate any help or advice."

How can I get myself a credit card and credit history so I'll be able to rent an apartment when I move out?","I hate my goddamn bitch of a narcissist mom who loves to infantilize and attack me for the most trivial of things, mainly pertaining to her strict standards of subordination.

Every day I look forward to when I can move out for college paid for by merit scholarships and my own money should my parents ever pull their funding because I don't talk to them.

The dorms aren't open on holidays or extended breaks so either I go back home or get and apartment and go there in the meantime. I do not want to face my family again. I want to be free and emotionally, financially, legally, and completely dependent of them. They're too far up their own ass to mend any relationship with me, and the infantilization and strictness has gone on my whole life.

4711,Tips - planning to move two years out,"I am 25, living in my hometown.  Just about finished with my masters degree.  I was able to start my career in a wonderful job, which is awesome.  My boss acknowledged when I began and at every review that he knows it’s just a stepping stone for me, and he is down to help me move up - which is awesome.

I got into the field of higher ed because I can work anywhere there’s a college.  The mobility and potential for advancement in my field is wonderful.

Recently it’s hit me that I need to move away.  This town seems to be going downhill.  People my age all leave it seems like, to bigger places with more things to do.  As a gay guy, there are no LBGT spaces and the pool of guys to date is very very small - I’m starting to think that if I don’t leave I won’t find anyone to date and hang out with.

My plan was to do 3-5 years at my job.  My mentor is telling me to shoot for 2 years. I’ve decided to aim for 3 years and see what happens - I’m coming up on a year now.  That’s enough time to reach some real fitness goals (another story).  In my field several years in a job at my level is very respectable and will lead me to a job with a better salary going forward, as long as I finish my masters.

Leaving this town is a dream.  My parents always acted like the town 45 mins down the highway was so far away, it’s where we’d go for “vacation” (working class).  My parents and my grandparents were born in this town, their parents arrived from Europe.  I don’t want to be like my parents and believe this small town is the entire world.  I want to see things and meet people before I get too much older.

Do you have any tips regarding ways I could prepare to move away, that I could begin now?  These are what I’ve got so far...

1. My credit cards are mostly paid down.  I will continue to work on these so I am as debt free as possible when I move (besides student loans of course).

2. In my apartment I’m treating it more like a studio, so o can avoid purchasing furniture and such for the living room space.  This way I can save money and have less to pack/sell when I move.

3. I’m looking at institutions and locations in Washington and Oregon so I know what to expect in terms of jobs available and the cost of living.

Any tips you’d give me to prepare?

If I never leave this town I’ll go nuts."

I don't know anything about how to be an adult.

Examples:
-I don't know how to get a job
-I don't know how to not get scammed for my salary or about how much should I work
-I don't know how taxing works or how it is payed
-I don't know how insurance, health insurance, dental insurance...etc. works or how to get it
-Should I go to a bank to get a debit or credit cards
-what is the difference between debit and credit cards
-how to not get scammed by the bank
...etc .

Basically what I lack is basic adult knowledge.

Why don't they teach this stuff in school it is easily more important than most of the other subjects they teach.

If you can link me sources from where to learn, stuff I've missed, or even tell me a little information i would immensely grateful.

4858,How to get your shit together?,"I’m going on 29 years old and feel like all I’ve ever known in life is being poor. I was raised by a single mom who never made over $10 an hour and often experienced being unemployed due to mental illness. We had to utilize church food banks when I was younger, constantly went without seemingly basic things like phone service. If it weren’t for my oldest sister sticking around years into her adulthood to help out financially, we definitely would have been on the streets. I was an honors student in school and assumed that I had a bright future with a great career ahead of me. However, I dropped out of college before my junior year due to my own emerging mental illness, joined the workforce, and was never able to go back. Within a couple of years I was fully supporting my mom and this wreaked havoc on my life. I took out loans and opened credit cards to make ends meet, most of which I was unable to maintain payments on. 

Now I’m almost 30 with my credit score in the toilet, a $14 an hour job that just *barely* allows me to break even on bills and necessities every month, unreliable transportation that affects my ability to get a better job, and I feel like I’m spinning my wheels. I literally have no hope of getting out of my situation.

4885,Help with leasing a new car?,"In December i (19f) am planning on leasing a new car. I was in an at fault accident in November of 2016 so in December of 2019 i will have my good driving discount back. I understand to lease a car i have to have full coverage insurance which is super expensive without a good driver discount, hence why i am waiting. 

I currently drive a hand me down 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid. In decent condition, but a huge ding on my driver side and half my front bumper breaking definitellyyyy decreased its value. I am the owner of the vehicle. 

My credit is not the best, and I currently have $835 in fafsa I have to repay for dropping out of school which is being presented as a debt so it is prohibiting me from expanding my credit in terms of opening new cards or getting a bigger line. I am responsible for the credit cards I do have, but my age and lack of “bigger” credit is weighing me down. 

I’m just wondering what even is the process to start this? I’m completely alone (no family members to help), and I work for the government and use all my banking through a credit union, if that matters. Should I buy a car and ask for a loan? Or is it cheaper to lease? Also are leasing and financing different?"

Anyone else like me?,"So I found out a few months after turning 18 that someone had been using my social security number since around 2004 (I was 4 at the time).

I’m only 19 and unable to do any of the normal stuff people my age are doing (getting credit cards, loans to help pay for school, apply for pay as you go things, get cars/ own apartments).

I’ve done everything they tell me to do. I’ve reported it and I’ve tried getting my hand on my credit report but it’s set up in a way that asks me about the person/people that have been using my number for so long. They then have alternative ways that are through you sending in your things with a utility bill but I don’t have any utilities in my name because I don’t have any idea what my credit is like because someone else had been using it so they are all in my roommates. I’ve been told to get a lawyer but I can barely even afford my rent most of the time. I honestly don’t know what to do.

4938,Moving Out of Your Parents’ Basement: Should You Buy or Rent?,"Let’s start with some basics you may need to know before you get out into the real world by yourself.

**What You Need to Know**

* Begin by establishing a deadline for when you want to move out. Chances are that neither you nor your parents want you living at home forever. So, first, talk to your parents about both your and their expectations for how long you will be living with them. This will give you an idea of how long you have to save, to budget, to search for a new place, and to prepare for #adulting.
* Next, you need to create a realistic budget. It is imperative that you budget and save during this time with your parents. Some parents might ask you to pay rent while others might not. Regardless, begin practicing your budgeting skills by setting aside how much you think you will pay in rent every month plus the amount you would need for bills and any “going out” money. Keep in mind that housing, transportation, and food will be the majority of your budget. If you allocate your money properly, you should be able to begin saving for your own place. It is important that you know what you are budgeting for. In other words, are you planning to rent an apartment or are you hoping to purchase your own home? The choice can seem overwhelming; especially if this will be the first time you are living on your own. However, for some people who lived in a rental during college, they might feel ready to buy a place. Here is a rundown of important questions to ask, what is included when renting an apartment or house, and the pros and cons of buying.

**Renting**

There are some expenses associated with renting a property you will need to consider. Some apartments, houses, or duplexes include utilities in the rent while others do not. In addition, you will need to furnish your new place unless it is pre-furnished. Cable and internet are two more expenses you will need to consider when moving into a new apartment. Finally, many people get renters insurance which covers damage or loss of property. When you are starting your rental search, look on property management or realtor websites, online listings on sites such as Zillow or Trulia, ask friends, or go to online forums for the city you live in or are planning to move to and ask for advice on the best places to live on your budget. 

Compare different rental properties before deciding. Make a list of what you want in a rental. Make sure the properties fit within your budget. Take a tour of each  option so you can see them in real life and get a sense of how you would fit into the complex. When touring, and before signing a rental agreement or application, ask whether the rental price will go up if you do not sign by a certain deadline. Questions to ask during your rental search:

* How much is rent and when is it due? How is it paid? Online, in person, by mail , etc. 
*  What is the length of the rental agreement? 
*  Who pays utilities? How do I set them up? 
* What amenities are available? Are there any extra charges for them? 
*  What is the policy for guest parking and pets? 
* Who pays for maintenance on my apartment? Whom do I contact? 
*  What are the eviction terms?

After you have chosen your apartment, you are ready to sign your rental agreement. You may have to pay a security deposit, which may or may not be refundable at the end of your lease. The property may also ask you to pay first and last month’s rent and/or have a co-signer. The rental company may need additional information such as who is living in the apartment, your income or employment information, rental history, references, and a credit history check. Always read the rental agreement and ask any questions you have before you sign.

**Buying** 

Having a stable house payment allows you to incorporate that expense into your household budget much easier. Although it is possible for your mortgage payment to increase over time because of changes in insurance fees and property taxes. If you have a fixed-rate loan, your principal and interest payment will remain set for the life of the loan, which could be as long as 30 years. Many people view home ownership as an investment with potential return. In addition to building equity with your monthly mortgage payment, the value of your home could increase in value. 

Finally, home ownership offers the owners a sense of stability and freedom, knowing that you have a place of your own to meet the needs of your family. Although buying a home can be very exciting and has many benefits, it is also important to think about the disadvantages associated with home ownership. In many cases, monthly rent at an apartment complex would be less than a monthly mortgage payment. 

* Some of the monthly costs of home ownership include: 
* Your mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. 
*  In most cases, if you do not have a 20 percent down payment, lenders will require you to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is an additional expense
* As a homeowner, you must either make repairs yourself or pay someone to do the work. • Often with home ownership, you have reduced flexibility, meaning you will most likely need to sell or rent your house before you can move.
*  Finally, the opportunity to build equity is generally considered an advantage to home ownership.

 However, it is important to realize there are no guarantees that a home will increase in value. 

Consider This After carefully weighing the pros and cons of home ownership, there is something else to consider before making your decision to buy or rent: How long you plan to live at the residence. Depending on the housing market, it may make financial sense to rent instead of buy. Although an advantage to buying is the buildup of equity while you are living there (as opposed to paying rent to a property owner), there are several upfront fees called “closing costs” associated with setting up a mortgage. If you plan to live in a home for a short time, consider how much your home value would need to increase before you would recoup the fees you paid in closing costs, in addition to any real-estate broker fees you would pay when selling the house. Because it can be difficult to predict the realestate market, buying doesn’t always make sense. 

**Four C’s of Credit**

*  Capital is the amount of cash you have available. As part of the home-buying process, you usually will need capital for the down payment, loan fees, closing costs, reserves, and moving expenses. 
* Capacity is your ability, based on your income, to pay your new mortgage payments as well as your other debts and living expenses. Your capacity is calculated based on your current income, income history, future earning potential, and amount owed, including car payments, student-loan payments, credit card accounts (Visa, MasterCard, etc.), and any other monthly payments.
*  Credit refers to your credit report and credit history. If you do not have a credit history, you will need to go through the process of building a credit history with receipts and payment slips showing regular monthly payments to property owners and utilities. 
* Collateral will be your new home. The lender will do an appraisal of the home you decide to purchase to determine the value of the house. Collateral provides the  lender with security on the loan if the borrower defaults (or does not pay the mortgage). A general rule of thumb to determine how much you would be able to qualify for is 2.5 to 3 times your gross annual income. This is assuming that you are in good financial shape, have a steady income, low debt, a sizeable down payment, and good credit. Using this as a guideline, a family earning $60,000 a year, would probably qualify for a loan between $150,000 and $200,000. Mortgage lenders often use ratios to determine the maximum loan amount for a borrower. Two common ratios used by lenders are housing expense-to-income ratio and debt-to-income ratio.

 • The housing expense-to-income ratio represents the maximum percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income that can be used for the house payment. Twentyeight percent is a common percentage, but different lenders will have different percentage requirements, normally ranging from 25 percent to 33 percent. Using 28 percent as an example, if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend each month on your house payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI) is $560. ($2,000 \* .28 = $560). 

• Debt-to-income ratio is another number often calculated by lenders. The debt-to-income ratio represents the maximum percentage of the borrower’s gross monthly income that can be used for all debts, including the house payment. Typically, to be able to qualify for a loan, lenders will have a preset limit between 36 percent and 41 percent. If your loan has a maximum limit of 36 percent, and if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend on your home mortgage plus all other debts, such as car payment, student loan, etc., is $720. ($2,000\*.36 = $720).

Want to move out of your parents’ basement? Follow this guide to begin budgeting, saving, and planning your move. If you pay off loans, take care of your credit, and weigh your options carefully, you will be living independently in no time at all.

4944,Have No Money and Traveling to Germany soon for Vacation,"Hey there, 21 M college student here

So heres whats going on with me.
Ive been working since I was 16 and had a great internship this past Summer, but decided to not pursue more work as my Fall Semester started. I enjoyed having more free time and am pleased with how much work I put into my classes this semester which just about ended! Anyway since I didnt continue to work I had no set source of income coming in, so continued to use up my savings leftover.

I currently have about $150 in my bank account and even worse - two credit cards open, one with ~$500, the other with $200.

I tried looking for work too late near end of November, because surprise surprise after lightly mentioning how I'll be free for January since Im not working. my mom then proceeds to buy me a ticket to Germany to visit my uncle. Great but unlike her im someone who likes to plan for things and fell under a great deal of stress due to my financial issues. My mom does try to tell me dont worry that she and my dad will help fund this trip to Germany but im not from the wealthiest of families so I don't know where this ""trip"" money is gonna come from, she told me she bought the ticket on a credit card.

Anyway its to late to get a job, I didnt have the best of luck finding work right away but just recently ive finally been called by someplace like Walgreens. But my trip is three weeks away, why would I start a new job now. I told my mom starting a new job is not an option and slowly have been coming to terms with my stress, my problems are all financial. So im trying to push into selling more of my things from my closet that I dont need, adding up $50s and $20s with everything I sell, trying to get by.

My mom keeps telling me dont worry go have fun, but like how am I gonna have fun when I have no money and my credit cards are sitting there waiting on monthly payments. Its been quite a stressful month for me but anyway my plan is to go enjoy Germany in any way I can, come back and get my fatass a job again so I can more fucking money. This whole experience just makes me more aware of how awful my mom is with money and worst of all, PLANNING. I love to plan ahead, my classmates even are shocked at how organized I am and how clean my room is since ""im a guy"". Its just how I am I guess. 

I absolutely admit when talking to my mom about going to Germany last month I was absolutely excited on the, idea since I barely travel. I wish I had thought things over but instead it was more of my mom going to a travel agency one day, calling me and saying hey theres this amazing deal for Germany! Which was true, it was a pretty good deal within the ~500 range but still. 

I hope to adult better than my parents when im older, being good with money and taking decisions unlike my mom &amp; taking responsibility and not sitting on my arse all day like my dad.

I know im not good with money, thats why I had ~$1000 in June and now $150 in December, but I absolutely admit it. I want to learn to be better, to grow. Unlike my mom who never admits shes wrong because of her ego. I want to learn from my mistakes but anyway, I hope I can scramble up atleast a couple hundred to enjoy with in Germany for 3 weeks, and then I can come back and get my arse another job. 

I call this moment of my life sonicbillymay's Financial Crisis of 2019, 

TLDR: Going to Germany in January, wish I planned this better so I can have money. Instead I dont have money. So I'll round up some change, then get my ass a job when I come back"
4993,How to make credit?,"I'm a college student and I desperately need credit so I can move out and be independent. I don't know anything about credit, I just know I need it. 


So, I'm just curious if there's some credit card for students that I can qualify. Where I live there's one that with $500 minimum, you can get it. I've been trying to get another one but the requirements for it are so unrealistic for a student."
4995,Finally paid off my ex’s debt!,"It’s a Christmas miracle. Six years ago, my ex racked up 2k on my credit card (we were still dating, she had terrible credit and couldn’t get her own) with promises to make the payments (she never did and it went to collections). A year later, I broke up with her.  When I asked her for the money, she went on a ‘woe is me’ rampage, accusing me of being heartless for asking her for money and blah blah blah.

Five years later, I finally made my last payment and am officially free of the debt she left me. My credit has also gone up nearly 300 points after she tanked my credit.

Feeling like a big time adult over here ☺️"
5013,Starting 2020 by fixing my credit,"So I got the idea to fix my credit when my Dad called about a cosigner. 

My credit is garbage due to bad choices during and after college. Mainly my major...

So I decided to use a bit of my savings to get a new credit card through my bank so I can repair my credit this year. I'm tired of sitting on a bad score, and I'm pushing 30."
5027,Are some banks better than others? (USA),"I use Chase bank and I feel like while they’re secure they have a lot of hidden fees. If I make five or more transfers in a month I get charged a fee and if I don’t have X amount of income then I get charged a fee. I need to open a credit card to start my credit soon but I don’t know if I should just switch banks entirely.

Also, are cash back cards worth it? What about airline mile cards? I think I’m more interested in the air mile cards because a coworker recommended I try one but I don’t know how any of it works.

Please help! I wish they taught this in school."
5035,I want to buy a house within 5-6 years from now. How do I do that?,"I [20F] have been living with my parents in the same house for 17 years, and we are renting. I do not want to rent for the rest of my life, therefore I would like to buy my own house after I finish college.

I am new to credit cards, I just got my first one in August of 2019, and my score is 698. How can I start saving to buy a house? What do I need to look for when I'm searching for a house? Any advice on buying a home and tips and tricks for the process of doing so are welcome!!"
5057,Any real life tips for getting yourself out of credit card debt?,"In America, if that helps."
5125,What are some handy things every adult needs to have?,"My car broke down yesterday while on the road, and my friend used this as an opportunity to completely admonish me for not having AAA and screamed I need to ""get my act together and sign up."" She may be right that it's a good thing to have, although I disagree with the rude delivery of the message. I just turned 24, still don't have everything figured out!!!! And haven't needed AAA before in the 8 years I've been on the road. Anyway, today I signed up for AAA plus, which covers roadside assistance and towing up to 100 miles, which is good since I drive a lot for work and my long distance relationship. What are some other basic things similar to an AAA membership that every adult should have handy? I already have a credit card/good credit score, debit card/bank account, venmo, cell phone/laptop/basic business electronics, car &amp; driver's license, gym membership, college degree and a job, etc. Please don't say health/car insurance, already have those until I'm 26 and then plan on signing up for them myself. 

I suppose check book is on the list, I have no idea where mine is but I never have to use it! Probably should dig that up though or get a new one. What are some other things every adult needs to have handy?"
5134,Just got approved for my first credit card and trying to understand these terms and conditions...," I’m reading through the brochure for my credit card application, and of course I understand the basics: charge to the card, pay them off monthly, don’t go over your limit. But there are some specific things that I don’t quite understand (and I’m not sure if I’ll even need that information but it doesn’t hurt to know) so I was wondering if anyone could answer a couple questions for me?

• What is the APR? Mine says it’s 27.24% and will vary with the marker based on the Prime Rate, but I have no idea what that means. There’s a little chart for the rate information and I have no idea what to make of it. Add to Index: 21.74% | APR: 27.24% | Daily Periodic Rate: 0.07463%

• Does the minimum payment mean that you have to pay a certain amount on the card each month? The brochure says: “The Total Minimum Payment won’t be less than $28.00. If your Account balance is less than $28.00, you must pay the amount indicates on your Statement in full.” So does that mean I have to charge and pay off at least $28 on the card each month? And if I only charge, say, $14, I still have to pay the difference in order to meet the $28?

For reference, the credit card I applied for was the Hot Topic store card."
5150,Turned 18 2 weeks ago and I have no idea how to adult or how to learn about adulting.,"I'm still not done with school but I think now is as good a time as any to start learning everything about the ""real world."" I don't know anything about taxes, I've never had a job before, I don't know how to cook, I don't know how renting a house or a car works, I don't know how bank accounts work or how to open a bank account, I don't know how credit cards work, I don't know how to manage my finances etc. etc. Basically I know absolutely nothing and would like to know where I could learn about everything."
5152,How important is it to build your credit score early?,"I'm 20 years old and my friends all have credit cards, mostly for emergencies, but I've seen them use it for small purchases when we're out. My boyfriend also has one and says the best way to build a good credit score is to make small purchases and pay off the bill in full right away, so you appear responsible to CC companies. 

I'm financially responsible, I buy what I need and occasionally the things I want, but expensive charges such as a new phone or my college tuition is paid by my parents. I've also been working for a few years and all the money I've made is thrown into my account that I have no access to (controlled by dad). 

I asked them for a credit card, and they accused me of wanting it to spend on luxurious things, or to go shopping constantly. They think I will rack up a big bill which is very unlike me. I would only follow my boyfriend's advice, which sounds mature and reasonable. 

I am not sure what to do, I am approaching the age where I will buy a new car, rent an apartment, or even buy a house in a few years. I know credit scores are important but how will not having one in my 20s affect my ability to get the things I need? How else could a company trust me to pay off expenses in a reasonable manner? I do not want to be financially dependant on my parents forever. I appreciate what they do but I want to take care of myself a little too."
5196,"I downloaded malware, what do I do?",Shit on some of my accounts is already changing. I can’t get to the Malwarebytes website to download that. I’ve put holds on my credit cards and changed as many passwords as I can think of. What do I do?!
5208,getting a credit card to buy a mattress..,"Pretty much, my mattress is just about shot. I bought it second hand about 3 years ago. Since I am moving into a new apartment at the end of the month, I figured it was about time for a new mattress. However, forking out the money for a good mattress at once is daunting to me and my wallet could not handle it right now since I am already buying a lot of stuff for this apartment (moving out of parents house, sold most of my college apartment stuff).

I was thinking of getting a credit card if possible and buying a mattress (within my current budget) and paying it off that way. Is this possible? Is this a sound financial decision?"
5220,I think i need some help but i dont know who to turn to,"  Hi all, I've been trying my hardest to adult lately. I was thrown out at 16 and 2 almost 3 years later here i am trying to pick myself back up but its hard with no family or friends to turn to.

5273,Got my first credit card... at age 25,"I’m so glad I found this page because I feel like I’m very late in “growing up.” That being said, I just got my first credit card. Any general tips, tricks or advice you’d like to share? I’d appreciate it. Thank you in advance 🙌"
5275,I faced bill shock for the first time,"Honestly looking for some solidarity and comforting here. So I went to the salon the other day to book an appointment and was told what I was getting done would ""be anywhere between 150-200"". I was thinking worst-case scenario the full 200. I was there for 5 hours and was getting nervous because I was anticipating my fate that what was done was gonna be beyond $200..... $330. THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-THREE. I thought I was gonna faint. For context, I'm a student librarian who makes $344 paycheques every two weeks. Really goin' through it rn and just needed to vent because my credit card is in pain. I'm finally experiencing the sitch of being so close to paying off a CC and then getting rammed with an exuberant charge. Adult expenses are hard."
5330,When and why should a person get a credit card?,"I've never had a credit card before. When I pay for stuff I usually pay for stuff with cash, debit card, paypal, gift cards or those prepaid credit cards. And on the rare occasion use my parents credit card for stuff I can't pay any other way then paying them back in cash.  

So now I'm thinking about getting my first credit card, as I'm looking to do more online shopping in the future and I hear credit cards are a more secure payment method for doing that instead of with paypal. Also for more independence from my parents I guess. 

I'm just wondering when you guys think is the best time for someone to get a credit card if they've never owned one before. What kind of card to get and why. What pitfalls to avoid. What to be aware of. I have a full time job, so I don't think being able to pay the bills will be a problem for me. But I've heard cases of people having pretty bad problems with cards, like getting into debt or paying a lot of money for stupid fees, and I want to avoid that."
5376,how’s my plan?,"so i’ve been thinking about my future a lot lately . it started off with me just being curious as to whether it would be possible to get a college degree in less than four years. a couple late night google searches later and i now know the name of two adopted daughters. 

anyways, i think im a little too young to be worrying about all this but i do think it’s important i have a career choice in mind. i was really big into having a job i’d genuinely enjoy but to cut things short i have a long history of mental health and physical health problems all relating to an unhappy life style and high levels of stress, something i really didn’t want to bring into my adult life. finding a career i didn’t hate sounded like the best way to keep that shit out. 

but i don’t have many hobbies that i’m passionate about or anything that can be made into a serious career. i know i want to attend college, actually i want to benefits going to college gives you but who doesn’t, but i also know i’m not good at keeping my mental health and school life stable at the same time. so i started thinking about what careers i could get with minimal time in school.

i eventually came across dental hygiene. i don’t hate the idea of being a dental hygienist but to be clear it’s not the dream but it’s probably closes thing to it. 

doing the research it could take just two years to get an associates degree and become a dental hygienist. but then i started thinking about money.

i figured if i get a job now and save up until i start college i can easily pay my way through classes and even have some left over. i could take the left overs and put in a savings account. i figured i could work part time on the weekends in order to add to it. the nearest community college that offers associates degree in dental hygiene is a good 2 hours away so i’d be doing online school and living with my parents. 

i like the idea of building up a savings account as a just in case so i thought what if after i graduate i stay home for another year while i work as a dental hygienist then take that year longs worth of pay checks and add it to the original savings account. 

i did the math but i can’t be too sure on everything as it’s almost completely out of my control so i did some basic rounding. 

i’d be able to afford the average rent for 2 bedroom apartment, if i stick to a budget i can afford to also buy new clothes monthly (not likely as i’m not a clothes shopping type and tend to hold onto things until they rip beyond wear), food, renters insurance, car insurance, tv and wifi bills and the other basics and still have extra left over every month. 

this is if i get a roommate. 

when doing the math i can probably live in my own no problem but i’d like to be able to continue with the savings account. 

i’m talking multiple savings account. i factored in how long it’d take to save for all of them and the absolute longest one would take 8-10 years and that’s for a decent 3 bedroom house (preferably with a basement an a decently large backyard but i’m just dreaming). 

now, i don’t know much about how loans and credit cards work but from what i understand i might be able to get a loan for house from the bank if i have great credit and i swear to you i will. my parents have shit credit and complain about it often, i will do everything in my power to stop that from happening to me.

that’s all the money stuff, now here comes to family stuff.

to be extremely specific i am a trans man (female to male). i start hormone therapy in a week and that will mostly cut my chances of getting pregnant- which is completely fine by me. there are trans men who choose to carry their own children but i absolutely refuse to. i also suffer from a medical condition that lead to me never having a consistent menstrual cycle and then completely cut off my cycle for 2+ years. i’m guessing the chances of having biological children are extremely rare but i’m okay with this.

i’m way too young to decide whether or not i want children but i am mature enough to decide whether or not i want biological children and i don’t. i actually plan on getting a hysterectomy as part of my medical transition. i know i don’t have to carry my own children in order to have biological children but even then i don’t want that. my family has a ton of health issues that i don’t ever want to pass down to a child. 

but like i said i don’t know if i want kids and i am way too young to decide for sure but in the off chances that i do decide i want kids i have a plan prepared. let me know if i’m wrong in any way. 

by age 28-30 i will become a foster parent. within that time i’m sure i’ll figure out for sure if i want kids. my research has lead to me believe that adopting from the foster system will either be extremely cheap or basically free. but again- i am way too young but i think it’s a good plan just in case i do decide i want kids. admittedly doing all this research and fantasying as actually made me a little excited.

i have a feeling getting babies would be somewhat rare and also not something i think i’d be good at. i think kids over the age of 1 would be my speciality but who knows. i feel really silly saying this but in my head they’re both girls close in age but pretty young. young enough so within the 1 1/2 years that i have to continue fostering them before adoption i can change their names. 

i always liked the name Paisley. the story goes i misread Halsey (back when she was getting big, not a fan of that type of my music but for a while she was everywhere) and thought it said Haisley, googled the name to see if it was in fact a name and Paisley came up and i ended up really liking it. i always kept it in the back of my head for a story character but never used it. I like the name Paisley Ana for the oldest. 

While i was day dreaming i also came up with the name Ashton, which i know is usually a guys name but i really liked the name Ashton Rose. I like the idea of a real butchy name with an almost overly feminine middle name (it’s not but in my head Rose has always been fairytale sort of name). 

I’m also fairly certain we’d be able to survive on my pay check alone after the house but i can’t be sure. if by some miracle i can then i’d take the money the government would be paying me to foster the kids and put it into a savings account for them for college or an 18th birthday sort of gift. i don’t know, we’ll have to wait and see i guess

and i know, i know, “what if they want to meet their bio parents? what if the parents come looking for them? what will you tell them?”

well, i’m not adopted nor am i a foster kid but my bio dad left before i was born and my mom been a real chap about it. 

my mom has always encouraged the idea of some day meeting him. she never said i had to wait until i was 18 or wait for him to find me. we tried a couple times but never did find him. she talks about him when i ask, tells me about their good times and bad times, things i do that remind her of him.  a lot of the people i know who’s dad are in the same place as mine hate them. wish their dad was dead or wish they could meet him just so they could start a fight and some wish they had been fathered by this mysterious man in their life. i have never been mad at my bio dad, never wondered if my life would have been better had he stayed, never wished him dead. i think maybe im like that because my mom never painted him as a perfect man or a bad man, just a man who made a few mistakes much like everyone else or maybe i’m just extremely passive. either way i wanna teach my hypothetical adopted kids to be the same way. 

so if i adopt kids i’ll never hide the fact they’re adopted. they’ll know always. if they want to meet their bio parents i’ll help them and if they decide much later they want to use their old name then i’ll be there when they get it legally changed. personally, though i love my step dad, i wish i never changed my last name. i wish i kept it because sometimes it feels like i’m hiding the only part of my bio dad i have. because i also don’t want to seem like a traitor i’ll be changing my last name too when i get older. i will either adopt my mom’s maiden name (with her blessing but she most likely won’t) or use one i’ve had in my mind for a while. i don’t want to feel like i’m talking sides as weird as that sounds. so if they decide they don’t want to “take sides” too that’s fine. 

anyways, that last part was sort of a little rant. let me know what you think of this plan or if i left something out (credit? i dunno man)- or just basic advice!"

5775,How bad are closed accounts on credit?,"Long story short, fell for a credit card scam back in December to get debt paid off, ended up racking way more debt. Credit utilization went up to like 150%. I was stupid and I learned my lesson the hard way. 

I called my credit card companies and there was basically nothing I could do, so my best option was to just keep making payments and pay off the debt myself.

I checked my credit score today and it went up to 654 from 592 (yay! my credit score has always been in the 500s), and my credit utilization went down to 0. I noticed it was because capital one and discover closed my accounts.

5848,Small Victories,"So I struggled for awhile trying to get approval for a credit card. I had goals so move out into my own place and it can be difficult to get approved for apartments without a good score even if you make 3x the rent.

Unfortunately my car finally started having some major mechanical errors and I decided to buy a newer car. With a little help from family, a decent down payment and trade in I was able to pick something out that fit my needs. I took out a small loan with my bank for 8,000 which I’ve been making regular payments on. 

I just checked my credit and since October I’ve gone from having 0 credit to a 607. It’s not great but I’m proud of myself. I’m moving into my own apartment in April and have a newer vehicle. Nothing’s perfect but I’m looking on the bright side and I’m pretty proud of myself."

5893,Gaining control over your finances,"	Hello ladies and gentlemen! This one is going to be a doozy so buckle  up! As I was brainstorming through ideas of how to be of most assistance  to you all, I tried to think about what skills or ideas had the most  profound impact on my life as I started my 20s. With zero hesitation,  gaining control over my finances was the first thing that came to mind.

	Unfortunately, in school, there seems to be a shortage on quality  personal finance experience. Many people enter adulthood with zero idea  of how to support themselves without help from the Bank of Mommy and  Daddy (BMD). I was one of these people. Of course, I understood general  concepts like “I can’t afford to buy this new car”, “Don’t open a credit  card and immediately max it out (I did it anyway)”, or “It’s good to  have some savings (But not mandatory, right?)”. But I never really  minded any of that or knew exactly how to implement it. 

# What Not To Do: My Experience With Money

	My sophomore year of college, I opened a credit card to pay the  security deposit on a house with my then-girlfriend of 3 years. Six  months later, we broke up and I moved out into another house with some  friends. With my name on the lease of the original house and no one to  take my place, I quickly took on two rents when I was struggling to pay  one and I had $0 in savings. I used my inheritance from my grandmother  to survive. This is the exact scenario I hope to help you all avoid  through this series of posts on finances!

	But worry not, this is a story of triumph not defeat. I managed to work  my ass off and stay afloat. My finances were awful for the next year,  but nothing near what they were during that 6 month period. In my senior  year, I found the holy grail of finance. Enter Ramit Sethi’s I Will Teach You To Be Rich.  Although the corny title sounds rather scammy, I had heard the book  suggested on a variety of podcasts and, finally, caved after hearing Tim  Ferriss’ interview with Ramit ([Episode 371](https://tim.blog/2019/05/07/ramit-sethi/)). This post references several of Ramit’s concepts from the book and I high, highly, highly recommend investing in it. 

	That’s enough about me. Let’s dive in to the nitty gritty of Part I:  Building a Budget.  We’re going to break it down into 4 easy steps:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Building your idea of a rich life
2. Building your current budget
3. Cutting spending
4. Creating financial goals

# Your Rich Life and Conscious Spending

	Before we bust out the actionable steps to get your finances in order,  we need to cover two concepts from Ramit’s book: Living Your Rich Life  and Conscious Spending. I’ll just be scratching the surface on these  concepts while Ramit takes a much deeper dive in the book. In short,  living your “Rich Life” is all about the fact that there is no reason  every one of us can’t be rich or enjoy the things we want to enjoy. That  means if you want to spend $200 on a jacket, go for it (with the right  system in place). If going out and spending $300 on drinks at the bar is  a part of your rich life, we’ll put it into your plan. This isn’t going  to be another post telling you to stop buying your $7 venti, non-fat,  organic, paleo, mocha, java, frappe with stevia and two pumps of  sugar-free vanilla.  As long as you identify what is truly important to  you, there is no reason for you not to have it. 

	The counter to this is “Conscious Spending”. You deserve to be able to  spend however much money you want on the things that mean most to you.  But to do that, you much cut back relentlessly on the things that don’t  matter to you. Example: If your $12 post-workout smoothie 5 days a week   is what matters to you, but you could care less what you workout in,  then stores like Walmart, Bargain Hunt, and TJ Maxx are where you need  to be hunting for deals on clothes, not Nike. And you need to be  utilizing as few outfits as possible. As we go into the initial process  of building a budget and building your “Rich Life”, you need to keep  both concepts in mind.

**Before  we move on, get out your phone, laptop, or a pen and paper and, at the  top, write “My Rich Life”. Underneath, write down everything that is a  part of your “rich life” no matter how silly it may seem. Once you’ve  done that, we’ll move on to building your budget.**

# Building Your Budget

	If you’ve ever sat down a tried to build a budget before, you’ve likely  heard to shoot for a 50/30/20 split. That means fifty percent of your  income is going to fixed costs like rent, gas, groceries, insurance,  phone bills, etc. Thirty percent is going to your wants like going out  with friends, video games, movies, books, and other dispensable items.  Finally, the last twenty percent is your savings, both short- and  long-term. Overall, this is a great guide. But it doesn’t fit everyone. 

	When I first started getting my finances in order, I took my income and  applied the percentages to see how much I could spend in each category.  After I took out for rent, utilities, car payment, and gas, I had $50  left each month to spend on groceries each month. That’s $12.50/week for  those of you busting out a calculator. If you can eat healthy,  convenient food for $12.50/week, please let me know how. Between school,  fraternity leadership, work, a relationship, and my family, I had  little time to prep all my food every week or bargain hunt cheap  veggies. So I adjusted the percentages a little to fit my lifestyle. 

	After looking at all my expenses, my budget looked a little more like  60-65/15-20/20. While you’re still in school or just entering the  working world, it’s okay for your spread to look like this. As you take  steps forward in your career, you’ll be able to get closer and closer to  50/30/20 or even surpass it with 40/35/25. But you have to be honest  with yourself about what matters (remember “conscious spending”).

**To  get an idea of where you’re at budget-wise, you have two options: If  you’re a card user (debit or credit), you can retroactively track all  your expenses from one month and see what you’ve got going on. If you’re  a cash user, track your next month of spending by keeping all receipts  and using either an excel sheet or an app like Mint or Clarity.**

# Cutting Spending

	It’s time to get ruthless. If you’re anything like me, after putting  together your budget and using Mint or Clarity, you saw how  unsustainable your financial situation is. Remember when we discussed  spending extravagantly on the stuff that matters and cutting back  relentlessly on the stuff that is less relevant? It’s time to be honest  with ourselves again.

	 When you examine your spending tracker, it’s likely something sticks  out to you and make you think, “I spend that much money on that!?!” But  don’t worry, we’re not going to immediately jump back to medieval times  and live with the lights off, bathing in a nearby creek. We’ll take baby  steps. 

	First, identify your biggest source of unnecessary spending and set a  reasonable goal for spending less on it in the next 2-4 weeks. If you  found that buying a case of beer every few days is setting you back, cut  back to one case for the week. Then one 12-pack for the week. All the  while, experimenting with other, cheaper beers. Don’t get me wrong, I’m a  craft beer guy too. But if you’re pounding 24 every few days, you’re  past the point of drinking as a hobby.

	Another good place to cut back here and there is groceries. Experiment  with various recipes and try buying mainly whole, real foods found on  the outer rim of the store, not in the center aisles. Invest in an instant pot  ($60-$80) and cook whole meals in there for the week. By buying large  quantities of whole foods and cooking for the whole week, you’ll feel  more accomplished and healthier which leads to more energy and  confidence. You’ll also save a lot of money on groceries and food by not  eating out as often.

**Before  moving on, try out the steps above. Identify your biggest source of  unnecessary spending and come up with a plan to slowly cut back.**

# Setting Goals

&amp;#x200B;

![img](lrzelh45yyh41)

	If you haven’t checked out my [post](https://20s.life/f/new-year%E2%80%99s-resolutions-it%E2%80%99s-ok-to-restart)  on making S.M.A.R.T goals, I highly suggest you hop over there after  finishing this! It is a much more in depth look at how to properly build  goals so that they get done. 

	When it comes to building financial goals for cutting spending, there  are two approaches: the big stuff and the small stuff. Focusing on the  big stuff means cutting expenses and organizing your budget based on the  large expenses. This means figuring out how to save money on your rent,  cable, car, etc. Focusing on the small stuff is more dialed in. This  looks like cutting out a cup of coffee each week, not adding queso to  your Chipotle, or buying reusable Ziploc bags (Bonus: This one’s much  better for the environment). 

	While, the small stuff is very effective and comes with it’s own  bonuses. It can also be very taxing on the psyche. Having 100 different  things to remember when shopping that end up saving you $50/month is not  a great return on investment (ROI). If you choose to take the small  stuff route, try finding one-and-done options like the reusable Ziploc  bags or investing in a coffee pot to make your own coffee.

	 Focusing on larger expenses will cut more off of your monthly  expenditure and, typically, only has to be done once. This looks like  negotiating a decrease in your rent by offering to not smoke or have  animals. Or getting a decrease on your cable bill by finding a lower  option and asking your current company to match the price (Pro tip: It  is much more expensive for companies to get a new customer than it is  for them to keep a current one; they’ll want to keep you). Ramit has  several scripts for these exact conversation on his [website](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-make-money-fast/).

	It is also important to set savings goals, the important part in these  goals is to approach them systematically and not get overwhelmed by the  size of them. For example, thebalance.com recommends having 1x your  income saved for retirement by the age of 30. With the average income of  people in their 20s being around $40,000, this can be pretty  intimidating. But let’s break it down. That’s $4,000 a year for our 20s  which is $333/month. This rate is much more manageable. I know it sounds  impossible for those of you still in school or working part time, but  as your income increases your savings rate will increase. Do not think  that you need to be saving $333/month at 21 lest you be screwed when you  hit retirement!

	Be sure to be realistic and time-oriented. Save enough that you can  live your rich life, but also put a “due-by” date on your goals. For  more steps regarding setting up goals that stick, I highly recommend  checking out [my post on S.M.A.R.T. goals](https://20s.life/f/new-year%E2%80%99s-resolutions-it%E2%80%99s-ok-to-restart) or searching YouTube for a video on S.M.A.R.T. goals.

	Once you have cut spending and are saving all you can, the only  direction to go is up, meaning increasing your income. There are a  multitude of ways to do this from negotiating a raise, to finding a  higher paying job, to starting a side hustle. I’m going to cover all of  this in a separate post as the information is way to broad to be covered  here.

# Conclusion

	Gaining control of your finances is no meager task. It can be scary,  stressful, or feel impossible. But the freedom that comes from it can be  life changing. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, just hang with me here.  Start with the few steps in this post and keep an eye out for the rest  of the guide. We’re going to cover it all: credit, increasing income,  retirement, all of it. 

	Once you’ve applied even just the simple steps from this one post,  you’ll already be light years ahead of anyone else who is still being  controlled by their finances. 

	Our 20s are tough. But only if we do it alone. Let’s figure them out together. 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Budgeting should be easy. You just need to be honest about what's important and cut back relentlessly on what is less important. Additionally, setting goals will keep you on track and accelerate your progress. This is all information that can be found on a post at my site: [20s.life](https://20s.life)"
5911,25yo M and need to move out and be independent.,"Hi Reddit,

I am a 25-year-old male who lives at home. I have never had a reason to move out and also did not make enough money to do so. But earlier this year I received a nice raise so I can afford to buy a new car and move out and do what I need to do. I currently make $15.50/hr and get a minimum of 10 hours of overtime every week (but if I request more the company will always oblige).

Here is a list of my goals (ignore the all caps):

1. NEW CAR

2. CREDIT CARD

3. OWN PHONE

4. OWN INSURANCE

5. OWN PLACE

6. COMPLETE SCHOOL (FUCK SCHOOL)

7. FIND ROMANCE

8. LOSE WEIGHT

The school goal will work itself out naturally (2 more classes and I am done). Also with the credit card -- I have already ordered it or put in the request with my bank. What I am looking for is detailed methods to the other goals. I.e. how to finance a car. How do I go about getting my own phone and phone plan or whatever. Do's and don't's of moving into an apartment. How to find romance. Weight loss I am about 235 and I want to drop to 200. I am avoiding all fast food and drinking smoothies at least every other day. I want to have a new car before I move out because the 2000 truck I have now is not reliable. And by new I mean like 2014 onwards."
5938,Credit scores and stuff?,"So I know what a credit score is, but I don’t know the details of how it works. I just recently moved into an apartment with my dad, and we both had to put our name on the lease. I’m 20 years old, but don’t currently have a job or any income, so he will be the only one actually paying for rent. 


As we sat down, the lady said something like “Now that you’re over 18, you get to put your name on the lease and start building your credit.” I didn’t know what she meant, so I was just like “cool” and nodded lmao. (I was busy the day my dad signed the lease, so he wasn’t there to help me when I went) 


I don’t know if she does or doesn’t know that I don’t have a job or a credit card or anything. I thought I had to have an income and a credit card to have credit? ...so her comment really confused me. Even though I’m not ACTUALLY paying, will it APPEAR like I’m paying because my name’s on the lease? And is it possible to build credit just by having your name on a lease??? 


Or maybe she was just listing adult responsibilities and stuff? Like “Now that you’re an adult, you get to do things like put your name on the lease, start building a credit score, etc.” even though she didn’t actually word it like that? Idk man, I’m confused."
5944,Ever since I've gotten a salary I feel like I blow money super carelessly.,"I just need some other opinions here. Or a reality check.

Rundown: I guess you can say I've never been in a tight money situation. I started working when I was 16 and have consistently been working since then, having multiple jobs throughout college. My parents still supported me so most of my money either went to food, alcohol or weed. I saved some, plus $3000 after my high school graduation and $4,000 after college graduation, I had $11,000 saved up. Then I spent about $3,500 on furniture and other various things for my new apartment. That left me about $6,000. I now make $1400 every two weeks at my new job. Currently still have $6,000 in savings. I don't have any outstanding debts/loans.

So here's the thing. I spend money super carelessly. Because I feel like I don't know how much I should have, and I've always had thousands of dollars to fall back on, so what does it matter if I spend an extra $20 on food today or go on two $500-$1000 vacations in a span of a month because $1,000 isn't that much compared to $6,000, plus I'm making it back with my paychecks now? And I have a ~credit card?~

I guess I need to know, is this normal? I've only been working a couple months so maybe I'm just ""carried away"" and reality will hit me like a ton of bricks soon enough. But is anyone else in the same boat? Have you had trouble saving money? How much should I have saved at 22?"
6028,No more junk mail,"I finally jumped through all the hoops and ""opted-out"" of pre-screened offers...so yesterday when I got the mail, instead of handful of credit card offers, mortgage refinance letters, and insurance quotes all I had was one piece. From my insurance provider. I opened it immediately, recycled the envelope and shredded the letter after addressing it."
6064,COVID-19 and a College Student,"It is very hard in times and situations like this to remain calm. I am a student from Georgia, and my University extended spring break another week, so two weeks off. I am currently freaking out about it. I am employed by my University but as a student worker. That therefore qualifies me as non-essential, which basically means for as long as this thing is here, I will not be receiving a check or getting payed. There’s is a possibility my University will extend this break to the rest of the year, putting all students in online classes. This is a terrifying situation to me because like many others, I live pay check to paycheck. I am a regular adult with credit card bills, car note, insurance, rent etc. How will all of these be payed within the next month if the entire United States it practically at a standstill? I currently have $2.48 in my bank account, a few cans of food, and one new pack of toilet paper that I nearly had to fight someone over. I cried today because the amount of money related stress that I am going through is getting to my head. Can anyone provide me with some advice? This virus seems to have no end in sight. How does the US government plan to elevate the hardships people are going through because of this? How can we live in a country where someone (not just me, but many others) has to worry about their entire livelihoods coming to a screeching halt if one paycheck doesn’t show up? This is insane. Advice?"
6124,[Question] how to see my debt and take out a loan?,"Hi. I’m trying to run away from an abusive mother this fall by going to a new university. I have a few questions I need help with and can’t ask her about.

1) how do I see my debt? I don’t have a credit card, I just have a debit card at a local credit union. I have federal loans I took out for school. How do I see them?

2) how do I take out a large private loan for university? How do I do it without a co-signer? 

Thanks y’all."
6136,"Posted this in r/movingout but nobody commented, figured I’d bring it here. TLDR at the bottom!","How do I go about moving out with a controlling mother? TLDR at bottom, this is a lengthy post.

I’m 22F and live at home. I moved back home last December after graduating from college. I work at a hospital making $17.30 an hour and I don’t pay anything to live at home, so I’m lucky enough to save all of my money (especially while I’m self-isolating and don’t go anywhere anyway). I get paid weekly and I usually bring home close to $500

I don’t really have any major bills besides my cell which is $104 a month (I’m financing my phone), I do have Disney+ which is $7 a month, and I did rack up about $2.3k in credit card debt because of textbooks so in total my monthly payments add up to $88. I don’t have a car because I always take public transportation to work, and I feel like I will be okay not having one for a while. Definitely helps me save on insurance, so that’s not a problem for me. Other than that, that’s really it for bills.

With this whole coronavirus stuff, I doubt I’ll be able to find an apartment anytime soon. I check from time to time and there’s nothing really available in my price range ($1300) at this moment. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years and we have been looking to find a place hopefully by the end of the summer, I hope that still happens but if not we are willing to wait it out. 

Now, I live at home with my mom, dad, and older sister. My mom is the problem, but I do want to reiterate my mom is not a terrible person. She has always helped me and supported me in every way possible and I love her dearly, but she still tries to control every aspect of my life. My dad doesn’t care what I do; he let me go as soon as I turned 18, so he’s not an issue at all. My sister can be a problem sometimes, she acts like my mom but I don’t let her bother me. 

Anyway, my mom always tries to micromanage my life, tell me what to do with my relationship even though she has never spoken to or met my boyfriend, she even told me not to tell my dad because we were together while I was in school and to this day I haven’t told him, tell me I need to do this or that because I’m an adult and she will constantly blow in my face that she always gave me everything. For example, a few days ago I did my sisters hair. I was on my feet for like an hour, I have knee problems so I was in pain after. My mom wanted me to do her hair too, I jokingly said no. She had an attitude for the entire day, complained to my dad, then the next day my dad lectured me about not stressing her out she gave you everything so be nice and all this other stuff. I just can’t because my mom is the type to not say no anyway because she feels bad if she does. So I don’t get it. She said she would help me buy a car, but I know FOR A FACT she would 100% blow it in my face if we ever got into it. I love her but holy shit don’t do something nice for me and then turn around and throw it at me.

So, here’s my issue with moving out. My mom is under the impression that at 22, I’m too young to live on my own. That after college you’re supposed to live with your parents. My mom thinks there’s this rule book to life and you absolutely have to abide by it otherwise you’ll be screwed in life or whatever. I feel like because my other siblings (theres 8 of us total and I’m the youngest of them all, 5 are my half siblings from my father) have somehow in someway screwed up in their life, when it comes to me my mom is trying to literally shove me on her version of the correct path. I know for a fact my mom would not approve of me moving in with my boyfriend before marriage, but I personally believe that before any type of commitment (even engagement) you should see how you and your SO live together. I personally don’t want to be excited about getting married, move in with him, and then find out that we cannot live together. I’d rather find out sooner or later.

So, my boyfriend and I are starting to save up for a security deposit, first and last, and a couple more months of rent just to be on the safe side. I haven’t told anybody my plans just yet, I want to make sure I have the money saved up first so that way I can at least say I am financially secure enough to have my own place. My boyfriend has furniture from his apartment that he’s living at now, so I’m not too worried about that part. I feel like if we can at least have a bed and storage, we will be okay for the first month or two.

I feel like when the time comes, it’s gonna cause problems between my mom and I. My mom would definitely call up some family members and complain to them and try and have them change my mind. I don’t want to deal with the backlash because it’s nobody else’s business. I’ve asked for advice among my friends who have been in similar situations, and they’ve all pretty much said that their parents got over it, it’s your life, you need to just do it because you’re an adult and they can’t control you or tell you what to do anymore. Any advice?

Tl;dr: my mom tries to micromanage my life and I want to move out with my boyfriend, but it’s gonna cause backlash and problems that I don’t want to deal with."
6224,How many rewards points do you generally need for a general night at a hotel??,"I have Wells Fargo’s and currently have 12,000 and planning on a big road trip next summer so not sure if I have 20,000 by then that will get me very much? Like I know it varies but like what’s the range? I’ve had my credit card for like a year and a half."
6261,Tips for Air travel,"So I just had this conversation with my younger brother and thought I share it here too.

Air travel can be intimidating, but it isn't hard, especially if you take a few steps to make it easier.

Checking in:

This is pretty strait forward. First, be sure to arrive at least an hour before your flight. Boarding usually starts about 20-30 minutes before take-off. If it's a big airport maybe get there 1.5 hours sooner,, and 2 hours for an international flight. Go to the check in desk for the Airline you are flying with. If you are going with multiple airlines go with the one you are flying on first. Almost all airports now have kiosks where you can do most of your check in. You can just just swipe a debit or credit card and it will bring up your info. If you need to check a bag or suitcase instead of carrying it on the plane after checking in you'll be sent to an agen. Have the tickets the machine gave you and an ID ready. Driver's license is fine, but if you are going international you'll need your passport. If they don't do it already you can ask and they'll point you at which direction to go.

Security

I don't know why, but people freak out over this. This is also where the most hold up is to be found. You'll wait in line a bit and then have to show a TSA Agent your boarding pass and ID. They'll make a few marks on your pass and then move to the scanners. 

At this point you are going to have to take off your shoes, belt or suspenders, and empty everything in your pockets into a big tray. Yes, your cell phone is going too. If you have a laptop or tablet in your carry-on bag it needs to come out and go in a tray. There is usually someone there telling people this over and over. Yet people still want to fight and argue. They always lose. Don't fight with the TSA, you will absolutely lose. 

It may be rediculous, but you will not get to keep the water bottle you brought from home to save money. Or a can of soda, big bottle of hand sanitizer, that pocket knife your grandfather gave you, none of it. I've seen so many things get taken and lost a few myself. I once lost a multi-tool knife I had since I was 15, carried it through two deployments, and many jobs. Just missed it when I packed my carry-on. They will offer you the opportunity to go put it in your car, sent it in the mail or put it in luggage, but this may not be a possibility for you. So be sure to check your bags carefully. Once on the scanner you will go through a metal detector. You may have to get a pat down there. It's not uncommon to miss a coin or a key or something in your pockets. If they are not, you can request that the person patting you down is the same sex as you. Don't ask for someone of the same race, I've seen that go poorly. 

You may also have to get your bags checked. It's not a big deal. You'll be asked to open the bag and perhaps remove some contents. If they tell you something isn't allowed you'll be given some options as mentioned earlier, but don't fight it. If you do want to go out to your car or whatever you'll have to come back through security. 

After you're done there you can put on your shoes, fill your pockets and go to your gate.

Going to the gate

This easy, just follow the signs. You may have to travel by tram to different parts, like in Denver they have 3 main concourses (A, B, and C) then numbered gates within. So if your gate is B23 you take the tram to concourse B, the follow the signs to gate 23. Minneapolis is laid out more in a horseshoe shape, they use letters and numbers and you just have to follow the signs to get there. There are also maps all around.

If you are at a bigger airport you'll probably have some shops and restaurants you can go into. Medium airports will have an A La Carte style shoppette with a few basic things, and small airports might have some vending machines. Prices will be marked up a little but its really not too bad. If you want to get some better food or some drinks for the flight its not a bad idea.

Boarding and flying

Unless its a smaller plane, you will board in groups. Parents with small children, the disabled, and people who need extra time or assistance (like the very elderly) will go first. The the higher class passengers like first or business class passengers. The rest of us economy peasants are broken into 3-5 groups. Your boarding group is on your pordind pass, you can board anytime after your group but if you try to go before you'll get turned away.

Once on the plane you can find your seat. There are little diagrams at every row telling you what the row number is and which seat is which. If you are a bit on the bigger side you can ask for a seatbelt extension if you need it. You won't be able to recline your seat or use the tray until after you are up in the air. More planes have entertainment systems on them now and should have at least something you'll enjoy. 

Depending on they length of your flight you'll at least get a quick service with drinks and snacks like nuts, pretzels, or cookies. Longer flights will offer a meal, you'll have 2 or 3 choices (one of which is vegetarian). There might also be an opportunity to buy better food or premium drinks like alcohol. 

Layovers

If you have a stop on the way you may not have your next gate on your boarding pass. But there are usually big screens that have that information. Look under departures and look for the city you are flying to, then look at the flight number (its on the boarding pass). If you are having trouble you can ask a gate agent and they can look it up. There is also a possibility you'll have to move to a different terminal and go through security again. At Denver you don't have to, but in Boston you do.

Arrival

Once you get to your destination its pretty simple, if you are traveling internationally you'll go through border control and customs. Its pretty simple, you'll show your passport and answer a few questions about your plans and maybe about what you have in your luggage.its not a big deal. From there you go to baggage claim. If you are not flying international you just go strait to baggage claim. There are screens that have the flight number and where it came from, usual over the carousel. It might take a few minutes for luggage to start coming out. Once it does you wsit for your stuff, grab it and leave the airport. 

Few extra tips:

-Dress comfortably, I get hot easily so I usually wear light loose layers. My wife is the opposite and usually brings a hoodie. 

-plan your carry-on. Bring medicine you need of course. But if it is liquid try to get individual packets. You can get small packets of drink mixes too. A tablet can be a good way to entertain yourself on a flight, as well as a book that doesn't need to be turned off during take off and landing. Pack charging cables too. I also reccomend battery packs for charging electronics on the plane. They are super handy and worth the money to get one that holds more charge.

-prep for security. Wear shoes that are easy to remove, but are comfortable. I usually stick my keys in my carry-on bag until I return home. And I try to have as little in my pockets as possible. I try to basically just drop everything in the bin and move forward as quick as possible. Then when I'm through I can grab my stuff and throw on my shoes all in 2 minutes and be on my way.


Upgrades

If you have never flown first class or business class on a decently long flight (2+ hours) I gotta tell you, its awesome. It can also be very expensive. There are some nice perks like  boarding the plane first and decorating first. Your luggage comes out first. Plus the seats are way nicer and you get better service, food, and drinks on the flight included. 

You can of course by your ticket for that class, but this is the most expensive way. You can buy a regular ticket and upgrade it, this is often much less expensive. Sometimes the price goes down if you upgrade when you check in. Don't be afraid to ask if an upgrade is available and how much it would be.

If you travel a lot you can get on a frequent flyer program and with a high enough tier you will get free upgrades."
6343,How do you buy a house? Florida,"I am so lost and confused at figuring this out. I am going to start saving now for a down payment. What I have found that I comprehend, I need to save up for a down payment. Which is fine, I'm gonna start saving money every week till I have at least $8k. I'm looking at houses less than 300k. 

But I'm overwhelmed. I have anxiety disorders so that isn't helping. I'm afraid I'm going to cry in front a realtor or lender because of the stress I feel over being 42 and not knowing this shit. Literally no one has ever explained it and at this age,.I feel stupid asking anyone outside of an anonymous setting. 

I have had the same job for 2 years, before that it was a job for almost 10 years. I make about around $6000 a month. I've also taken my credit from 340 4 years ago to 620 right now. I know that's still not great credit but I'm still fixing it using keeping up on a couple of credit cards and a car payment without any late payments in 2 years. 

I also want to move to ag land 1-3 acres where I can keep chickens and other small farm animals. I have found USDA loans but was wondering if there was any other avenues I should seek."
6357,19 years old feeling like a failure in life and getting kicked out.,"1. I failed High School poorly mostly because I was struggled academically and couldn’t understand the material it was put in below shitty classes even even then I struggle.

2. i’m really not that smart and because of that I suffer a highly abusive situation in the hands of my parents and my brother.

3. I don’t really know how to do some basic things that most people should know how and take care of myself do might be embarrassing but I don’t really know how to wash your ass or how to wash your dick and I have literally have orange shit growing inside of it like when you pull the foreskin back to basics and see a bunch of orange yellow shit. So I don’t really know how to take care of my skin and I feel like I have pimples growing everywhere.

4. Have zero money or barely enough I can’t afford to see a dermatologist or a therapist or a doctor about my issues.

5.Finally I don’t really know how to live on your own like the necessary skills cooking I struggle with that and I have suffered I can’t really remember shit I tend to forget things so it makes my cooking order. 

Very important thing I don’t know how to do is understand how money works like really know what a foreign key is I don’t know how personal finances work what is that what the hell is credit what is taxes what is insurance I barely know a thing about it my parents refused to ever teach me the only thing I don’t even know how credit cards work the only thing I know how to do is use cash to buy random shit that’s it that’s it I don’t even know banks work."
6508,Tips for getting a car by yourself?,"For background I never really had a supportive family. I wasn't allowed to have a job while I was at home and I wasn't allowed to be an adult while it was all I ever really wished for. After I left home to go to college, I got a full ride scholarship to college but to build my credit I got a credit card and now have a pretty high score with okay borrowing power. 

Fast forward I'm 21. I've been a full time student with a couple of internships and a job as a VR service attendant for the past three years which gives me a lot of experience in my field. Covid has seen me currently unemployed but I know I'll bounce back! I graduate in December 2020 so it's time to get the rest of my shit together so when I search for fulltimes there isn't anything in my way. 

Where I live, NC, USA, you have to have insurance to be able to get your driver's license. Seeing as my family was unable to put me on their insurance to even get a license I'm kind of stranded to even get a car. I don't know where to start and while I ask them for tips (not financial help), they just tell me not to worry about it and that I don't need to car right now. Well how am I supposed to get to work if I don't have reliable transportation? 

I need help. I need to know what I should be looking for in a used car (I think I may go to CarMax because it's been recommended by my friends and bosses but any other places are good too), what I need to do for insurance, and then I can get my license. I use Kelly blue book to get prices of cars and so far I'm thinking early 2000s Chevy Impala or Volkswagen Jetta as they are pretty reliable and fairly priced. I'm more leaning towards an Impala as it's parts are cheaper. I'm also leaning toward asking my credit union for a loan instead of the dealer as I've heard if you have your financial situation already fleshed out it could get you a better deal and end up being less interest. 

Any other info and tips is very much appreciated and if I'm thinking to naively feel free to correct something as everything I've gathered is my own research and experiences from my college friends."
6511,"I'm 26, and I am not an adult.","So, my situation is that I graduated from college last December. It took me 7 years to graduate and my parents supported me the whole time. I moved back in with them right after graduation and I live in their house now. 

My problem is that I don't know how to be financially independent. I don't pay my parents rent or help with the bills. They paid for my car. They pay my credit card bill. I live like a parasite.

I do have some adulting skills. I know how to find apartments, I can cook and clean, I do my own taxes every year. I lost my job due to covid but I have held down jobs long term. What I don't know how to do is be financially independent. It especially feels hopeless considering the state of the world. How am I supposed to support myself using my own two feet?"
6549,Not sure if I’m doing the right thing.,"Hello all, 

Recently I have been saving up my money for when my family moves and I’ll have to buy new furniture for my room and other things since most of my stuff is from G&amp;W. Saving up for about a year since I got a new work-study job on campus, but ever since the Rona hit I haven’t been getting paid. Fast forward to today and last week, my step-dad comes in and is being weird about stuff (asking me how I’m doing, school, just in general trying to be involved w my works) and I knew he wanted something. I ask him if he needed anything and he told me that if I could let him use my debt card to pay off his credit card, now I only thought this would be once so I allowed it. Yesterday, he came in asking for the same thing and again I allowed it, usually is $100. Sure he pays me back with some interests, but I feel like I should be paying my OWN debt and not the debt of someone else. I want to help him improve but idk how. He just isn’t good with money sometimes and doesn’t trust banks for some reason. 

Should I stop paying his debt? I want to start building my own credit, but can’t do much atm. Would I be a bad step-son by not helping him pay it off? How can I tell him in a nice non-confrontational way?"
6550,Should I Move Out?,"There's a tdlr at the bottom.

My current living situation isn't ideal. Since my family isn't the richest, we often have to live in 'less than good' neighbourhoods in an apartment. Throughout my teen years there was a constant issue with cockroaches in our previous apartment. We moved a few years later, and now in our new place, after 4-5 years without any bugs, there's been quite a few bug issues. Currently we have an infestation of cockroaches and possibly bed bugs (though my parent says they handled it). Since I didn't understand how to use credit cards (I got one right after I became an adult and after a depressive episode I spent a lot; definitely my mistake), I took on about 7000 dollars (CND) in debt. That and student loans of about 20k (CND) and probably 5k more for my last year. I really can't handle having bugs in my living space anymore. My parent's been doing some things to handle the cockroaches, i.e. putting borax in a cabinet with food in storage boxes, but not to the point that it'll probably remove the cockroaches, i.e. keeping the sink dry everyday (fyi, I tend to sleep earlier than the rest of my family members (they sleep till 3 am sometimes) so if I do try to make sure things are clean esp. in the kitchen, they usually get midnight snacks and put unwashed dishes in the sink). And I remember that when we moved from our last place, I don't think the cockroach issue was solved. I'm constantly worried about eating (food poisoning) and sleeping (that one will crawl into my ear). I'd like to call the landlord today about the issue, but due to the quarantine, kind of scared to, esp. since cockroaches are persistent. I want to go to grad school after my last year (this upcoming one) but I don't think I can do well in my classes if I'm constantly commuting for hours and can't sleep because of bugs. 

Should I take on an additional 5-10k in loans (in addition to the 5k that I have now), to live outside of my current home for the school year, or should I suck it up?

Is this normal?",I get paid every week and I usually throw a big chunk of my check at one of my cards plus pay any bills necessary. I just feel guilty that as an adult I don’t have 1k in emergency savings yet. I don’t know I feel like I should by now especially with this pandemic going on. It’s going to take me a while to pay these cards off so in turn it’s going to take me a while to pay off these cards. I mean I do have enough in my savings to completely pay off one of my cards but I feel like that’s not really a smart move. Am I overthinking this or am I doing just fine prioritizing paying off debt?
6621,i’m really concerned...idk if that’s the right word,"my credit score went down 9 points and i don’t know why. i paid off 100% of my credit card debt. wasn’t a lot, but better than minimum payment, i added centurylink to my monthly payments, and i was one day late for my utilities but that’s it.

6627,Buying a condo with no rent history?,"My (23F) boyfriend (23M) and I are graduating college in December and are set up to start great jobs, so we’d like to look for home loans and get a condo pretty early on in 2021. He has 30K in a trust from his mother passing away that he wants to use towards a down payment. His credit score is 721 and mine’s 698. The issue is, we are just now transferring non-credit bills to our own names and have lived with our parents up until now, so the only credit history we really have is on credit cards and student loans we don’t have to start paying yet. 

Is it too unrealistic to get a reasonable home loan at this stage? We don’t want to dump money into rent when we could be paying a mortgage."
6695,Just paid off my credit card debt from the last 8 years.,"I got a credit card when I was 20 because I worked minimum wage at a crap job and couldn't afford groceries. Over the years, it stayed almost maxed out, but I made sure to pay at least minimum. Because of my steady payments, my limit kept getting increased, from $300 to $3000. Each increase caused my dumb brain to spend more. 

Over the last year or so, my husband and I have been working hard to get our finances figured out, so we can buy a house in the next few years.

Today, I was able to pay off that $3000! My oldest account is now paid off, and I can still use that card for my groceries to build my credit score even higher. New house, here we come!"

I didn't care for my job (I only made slightly above minimum wage and it was a dead end office job), but I needed to experience and money with the end goal of eventually moving out of New York (I've managed to save 23K).

Now that I've lost my job, I don't know what to do next and I'm not sure if I even want to apply for another position in NYC (I have no desire to place roots here and develop a career in this city/state).

I've applied for unemployment and now my next focus is paying off the rest of my credit card debt/student loans hopefully. But honestly right now I'm lost and feeling like I'm just running around in circles."

6748,(22F) Advice on moving out and living on my own,"So I’m 22, just graduated from college in May, braved hell through the pandemic and just landed a job in November. This jobs pays well enough to cover my loans, car insurance, phone bill, food, and other monthly charges for my gym and internet while allowing me to save. It’s only part time and has the potential to go full time, but I don’t have an exact time frame in that. 

Now onto my dilemma. I live with my parents, one of whom is terminally ill on disability and needs a full time caregiver. My relationship with them isn’t great and overall my situation at home is not good, but I have no clue how to move out. Even though I went to college and worked full time, and my parents did not pay more than $1-2k a year on my $50k yearly education, and still continued to claim me as a dependent. This totally screwed me with FAFSA, and because I still live with them, they are trying to claim me as a dependent until I’m 24. This is part of the reason why I need to move out. Although my parents assume the financial burden of me on paper, I am still paying the bulk of it myself outside of a warm bed to sleep in. 

I also have no idea how to get medical insurance like Medicaid, because knowing my family, when I move out this will severely sever ties with them, including their insurance . 

Basically, what resources can I access to get support? My family has never helped me with things like this, and won’t be keen on doing so given our relationship. I’ve had to get a car on my own, open a saving account, credit card etc, all on my own and I genuinely just need advice on how to do this. 

Is there anyone else in my situation who has done the same thing and can give some advice?"

Here’s the bad news: no credit, no potential roommates, no one I know is trying to move out or make an attempt to adult. My mom wants to move to another state and I can’t go with her because I have job security here and it’s where my chosen family is. Plus she’s wanting to move somewhere way more conservative and my lil lesbian self can’t do that move.

I want to buy a fixer upper, so I can flip it.

My dealer said I could refinance in a year or so and possibly get a better interest rate. I’m also at a point where I am comfortable putting more down on my loan. (I have a loan that I can put more down without penalties) 

So my question is, should I refinance then put more down, or put more down and then refinance? Or does it not really matter?

7058,Advice on dental insurance?,"A couple of years ago I had several rounds ofq chemo, stage 3 breast cancer, and it completely wrecked my dental health. I have a broken tooth that needs surgery to be removed and the dentist refused to tell me exactly how many cavities I have for fear it might cause me anxiety, which actually caused me more anxiety but that's besides the point, lol. 

There is absolutely no way for me pay these costs out of pocket, I was thinking insurance was the best way to go. The dentist also recommended care credit, a credit card for medical purposes but I'm already in hundreds of thousands of medical debt, I would like to avoid that at all costs if possible. 

Any advice or tips on the subject would greatly be appreciated."

I'm still getting an income, but it's inconsistent. Unfortunately it might have to be longer  than it should for me to be able to move out. But I need to be in a position to be able to whenever possible.

And yeah, I know that getting a consistent job is huge in this, but as of now this is my only option going foward.

I know building my credit is a also crucial part in this, but I'm really struggling with trying to figure out where to go from here.

People keep recommending I try a low limit credit card, but there's always an issue with the ones I find. Either it is only valid while I'm a student, has an incredibly high required payment, or an insane interest rate, which the last part might not be too much of an issue for now, but still.

Others say getting on another's card first is the way to go, but I don't have anyone to do that, so that's not exactly an option either.

I haven't been able to find any cards offered by my bank that are reasonable for me.

I've even tried applying for specific cards like musician's friend for example, but I still got declined because of my non-existent credit.

7214,Why did I fail a credit check for a phone contract?,"I could use some advice from someone who knows more than me. Yesterday I tried to apply for my first phone contract under my own name. I'm 22 and live in the UK.

I failed the credit check. I have a credit score in the 700s and I've had a credit card for over 3 years, so I was taken aback by this. I called the provider I was intending to sign with and they said I could send an appeal, providing me with an email address and instructions on what to include.

So I wrote an appeal email which included my personal information, my current address, previous address, employment status (as a student) etc. I then had to make a case for myself. I included that I have a high credit score, a long standing credit card with my bank, and that despite me being a student and having only recently moved into new student accommodation, I would have absolutely zero issue paying monthly for a phone contract, especially one that would be less than £40 a month.

The same day, I received an email back saying my appeal failed and that the decision to deny my credit check now stands for 90 days. Furthermore, and this particularly rubbed me the wrong way, they claimed they are unable to provide me with specific reasons for why I failed the credit check. I don't understand why this is the case unless it's somehow illegal or a data protection issue, but then it's my data anyway so what's the issue?

Any advice? How can I prevent being denied phone contracts? What it is that's causing a problem?"

My big question is this, say I make a payment on Monday using the credit card. Can I pay it off on Tuesday just so it’s out of the way? Or would it be better to wait until I get an alert at the end of the payment period? Would paying it off sooner affect my credit score in any way?

All I remember from my older siblings is that they fucked up their credit really bad, and now they’re trying to rebuild from the group up again. 2 of them are at an average, but the other two are at a low average. 

I asked my brother what I should do, since I’m deciding to get 3 of them. He said “get 3 or 4 credit cards, but don’t use them. Don’t spend shit on it, pay the annual fee and that’s it. Don’t use it, treat it like it’s not there.” I was super confused cause he said I’d still be building up my credit like that. I’m not sure how. 

I was super confused, because I’ve previously had questions about credit in econ in high school, and all my teacher would say is “treat your credit cards like they’re your babies”

Now I’m just stuck at some sort of limbo where I feel like I don’t know what to believe or think about just general credit and how to build it.


Do I still use the 20% or 30% of my maximum or do I treat it like it’s just there and not spend it?? I’m so confused."

7410,Adulting (arguably) well lately!,"I got my first credit card 4 or 5 years ago with a stupidly low credit line of around $200. It was fine at the time since all I used it for was lunches while at work and that was about $50/month since I brought my lunches from home too. Present day with the same credit card, the credit line is only $500. A week ago I leased my first new car(!!!) and put my down payment on my debit card. The dealership people asked me why not put it on my credit card so I could get rewards (1% back for example) and I was embarrassed to admit that I had nowhere near enough of a credit limit for that. 5 mins ago I applied for a new credit card with better rewards and was instantly approved and with a new credit limit of $5000!! 10 times more! Just so proud of myself for accomplishing two big adult goals of mine in the past week 😀

P.s. Just wanted to put it out there before anyone gets concerned, but I’m not going to go crazy and buy superfluous things just because I can now. It’ll just be nice to have when I eventually need to buy furniture/other expensive stuff and I’ll be able to put it on my credit card and get rewards instead of getting nothing for using my debit card."

I've made it this far working shitty minimum wage jobs within walking distance. Approaching coworkers to help is something I cannot do, and if you tell me to bootstrap then do not respond because all I've ever done is bootstrap.

If I don't get a license and at least a scooter I'm fucked, I cannot continue working for 7.25/hour 20 hours a week. I'm going to have to walk around 10 miles tomorrow just to get my ID updated and pick up my food stamp card. I am utterly alone in this.

What's the reasoning behind it and should I be worried? Am I going to be charged a insane amount right off the back?"
7634,Save money or pay debt,"So I acquired about $1,700 on a care credit card when my cat nearly died in december.  Thankfully I get 6 months no interest and had written a whole plan with the amount I need to pay each month to pay it off in 6 months. 

But now I'm getting my tax refund and I just had a thought. Now when he almost died I paid 1400 out of my savings which put a dent in it bc I had just started building it up to a point where it was growing decently. With my tax money I planned to save half of it then use the rest to pay off my regular credit card, pay off my phone and invest. But now I'm wondering if it's smarter to just pay off as much of that as I can. But I'm torn because it would bring my savings closer to where it was before. Then I think ""Well if you paid down the card, you could just use the money you would use on the card toward your savings"". 

I'm just not sure what the smartest move is. I know generally it's taking care of debt first and I'd love to have my credit cards down but also want my savings up."

I have all the money in my bank and I can pay off the whole credit card bill right now if I want to, but my family says I should just pay the minimum balances over a couple months since I still don’t have a job right now. If I pay the minimum balances over a few months instead of paying everything off right now, would there be any negative impact on my credit score? I don’t fully understand the importance of a credit score, but people keep saying it’s important, so I’m trying to do what I can to keep it good."
7867,I feel like I'm out of options.,"I'll include a TLDR at the bottom for those of ya'll who don't want to read everything, just read the paragraph below and skip to the bottom. 

Before I explain my entire situation I want to make sure everyone who is reading this is aware of one pretty important thing. Both my SO and I, are both legally blind and thus, can't drive. We are NOT completely blind, we have ""functional vision"" and can do quite a bit of things, however, we both can't drive or operate any motor vehicle legally, so finding a job IN THE AREA we can do is pretty hard.

Now that I have that out of the way, let me give a bit of backstory and context to our current situation.

Originally we are both from Florida but lived in different cities, after a while she moved in with my family and I, and a while after that we decided to make a move to North Carolina. At the time of our move, we both didn't have a job but were in a very long hiring process with a reputable company for work from home positions. She (my SO) had a childhood friend that let us stay at her house until we finished the hiring process and were able to move into our apartment that we had found while we were still in Florida. We stayed there for a little less than two months before we moved into our place. My SO didn't get the job but I did. 

So my SO and I moved to a new place, where we have no family and a friend of mine who I had known for a while who was helping us adjust to the new city. My friend helped us A TON, he found us a bed, gave us food, and a list of other things including money sometimes. 

Fast forward about 6 months and everything was going fine. My SO was struggling to find a job she could do since we had moved to a fairly small town. At this point, I was also looking for another job that would pay a bit more too since I was in a sales job that was part-time and was barely keeping us afloat in conjunction with my SO's SSI. 

At this point, I would be getting SSI but I was making too much at my sales job. BUT, about two months ago, I lost my job with the company because of semantics and overhiring. You would think that I would be perfectly fine since all I would have to do was call the SSI office and let them know I was no longer working right? NO, apparently my mother was still my payee, and that needed to be changed. And I also needed to send them my paystubs for the entire time I was working so they could see if they owed me anything. So as I am typing this, I am STILL waiting on a call from the local SSI office to talk about lord knows what, my SO still can't find a job, and neither can I. 

Additionally, we've pretty much run out of savings, super late on our credit cards, and today I just go ta letter in the mail about the electric company disconnecting our electricity due to late payments. Not to mention the water bill and other things coming up. Putting me and my SO in a terrible spot where we need to come up with roughly 300 dollars in a couple of days before our water and electric get shut off AND if that happens we apparently can get evicted as they are required according to our lease.  We both feel cornered, We've already asked friends and family back in Florida for help before, so we can't do that either. We are basically waiting for the SSI office to call me back before we lose everything and wind up on the street. 

I'm grasping for ideas, advice, resources, honestly anything at his point. 

TLDR - Limited job options, loss of my job, collection of bills, and having nowhere to go have left me and my SO soon to be homeless, need help, guidance, or to find a winning lottery ticket on the ground."
7868,"Health Insurance from Work or Marketplace - Help Me, Please...","I'm trying my best to find out which plan would work best for me. I've been told to always look at the monthly premium and base that on how often you need RX drugs and/or doctor visits.

7928,When should you switch banks?,"Hi friends. 

My parents are a member of USAA thanks to my grandpa’s time in the military. Given the eligibility rules, I have two checking and savings accounts through USAA but am not eligible for any of their other services (credit cards, insurance, etc). Now that I’m 22 and have an apartment, I’m curious when I should move banks that don’t have those limitations. I have renters insurance through Allstate, don’t own a car, and have a Discover credit card. I live in the Seattle area so BECU is an option that many people recommended. 

When should I make these banking moves?"
8059,What do I even do now?,I am 19 and before COVID hit I had nearly $10k in savings/investments. I lost my job and had to liquidate all of it to pay rent (to my own parents that are well off without my rent). I finally found a job but because I had a lot of months of bills to pay off I have literally been living paycheck to paycheck and it scares me. If I never liquidated my assets I would have nearly $25k now and that’s what makes me so upset. But now my sister moved here and I can’t decide if I should move out with her and pay a little more for rent or just stay where I am. I hate the stress of living paycheck to paycheck and I don’t even know what to do if I can’t pay my bills. I’ve always paid my bills and credit cards early so what happens if I can only pay the minimum? Does it affect my credit score badly?
8182,"Just turned 21 and moved to the US, having trouble getting started here"," 

I was born in the US, spent most of my life in another country and just got back to the US last week to start a new life. I have my Passport, SSN and birth cert with me.

I moved to CA and I'm trying my best to get started but I'm having a hard time getting started, I can't really buy anything online with the cash I have in my bag.

Most banks won't even accept me because of my lack of information, I live with a family member so I don't even have any proof of address. I can't even get a drivers permit because of having no proof of address. I have a drivers license from the country I came from and law says I can use that for 30 days, but I couldn't get an insurance because I had no online bank account (they wouldn't accept the debit/credit card from my country).

I messed up and bought a pre-paid cellphone number because its cheaper, but it turns out I should of bought a legit cellphone number because they would put my address on the bill, which I could of used for proof of address.

I got a Capital Checking Account Approved, but I can't deposit anything into it since I need another account. I just need to find a way to get a proof of address to get started, so I can open up an account at my local credit union and deposit the cash I brought. 

I heard from another Reddit post I can just print out a lease agreement and use that? Is that legal tho? Is there anything else I can do to get an address? I also registered for voting, waiting for them to mail something to me too."
8205,Can anyone explain how a credit card works?,"I’m 23 and I have a basic understanding of it but my parents never really went into full detail of the consequences or benefits of having one. Besides my parents are horrible with money and I don’t know if I’d even trust their advice on this anyway. I’m basically looking to sign up for some kind of credit card to pay for school. I’m looking into online school and nothing that would take years to achieve, just a few months worth of courses to get a certification. I live on my own and have rent and other bills to pay so paying up front probably isn’t an option right now so I thought if I get a credit card and put the payments for the classes on there then I wouldn’t have to pay it back for a few months correct? Or I could make payments as I go rather than having to pay the couple hundred dollars up front. Any advice on any of this would be great as I’m pretty much trying to figure this out on my own."
8208,"Desperately need to leave where I am ASAP, just need the basics of renting a room from someone explained.","I’ve never rented a room before and I’ve got nobody in my life to ask.  I’m poor, currently unemployed, can’t drive, rock bottom, trying to just get on my feet, and tried to move in with an aunt I barely know all the way across the country just to get things turned around.  Turns out she’s legitimately insane, despises my mother, and is taking out her anger/jealousy of my mother on me.  Beyond that she’s absolutely disgusting and will do things like leaving meat laying on the counters all day that her cats will lick/eat or she’ll take pots and pans she wants cleaned and will give them to her dog to lick clean before vaguely rinsing them and then putting them back in the cabinets.

I landed and have been treated like a house servant and I’ve done a lot of work.  Raking, scrubbing mold off of surfaces, all of her dishes, always taking her laundry out of the dryer and folding it for her, always taking out the trash, managing her pets—I even spent time ripping out an old moldy carpet and cleaning a side room top to bottom, moving and installing a washer and dryer for her, and cleaning out the slow drains in the bathrooms and kitchen.  Every three days I’m being yelled at about something strange like not taking the green waste bins inside within 30 minutes of the garbage men come and take care of it, and I’m fairly certain she might be using drugs or something with her checking to see if my door’s locked before she zooms off on mysterious 3AM trips.  She also accused me and my mother of stealing my grandma’s credit card information to buy me things because my mother was sending me and my aunt Christmas gifts VIA Amazon and I didn’t tell her exactly what was inside.  It’s stuff like that constantly, and it’s freaking me out to be around, like I think it would most people.

I potentially have an online job lined up for $1,000 a month if I can pass some tests they want me to take, which I plan on studying like hell for.  A local person I know of is offering a room for $575 a month with a $175 deposit.  I don’t know him personally and obviously I’d want to meet up with him first, but if I were to take him up on that offer once I get the green light from the employer, is about $850 a month (freelancing tax, no state/local income tax here) enough to survive on *at first* with that sort of a deal?  I’d want to get another job too obviously and have been applying to a lot in the area but I’m trying to get out of here ASAP and am willing to spend some time just barely scraping by if it means I can get away from this ticking time bomb.

Are there any more expenses I’d be expected to pay for in this kind of a situation aside from the $575 and my own food?  I’ve also got 1.3K I can stretch out for however long that’d last, though I may need to buy a bike depending on where he lives.  I found the guy’s Twitter so I’ve been going through and getting a read on him, but I haven’t reached out yet.  I know that’s the best way to know but I’m not sure if it’s normal that you’ll have to pay more than the upfront cost for renting?

I’m just overwhelmed.  Any help/advice would be appreciated."
8315,Tips to buying homes?,"I am only 18, just barely moved out on my own, but I’m still trying to prepare for owning a home. I live with my fiancée of 6 months in a small 1 bed/1 bath for a fair price. 

We want to have our home bought by the time we’re 25, but we know that’s a lot of work to do in 7 years. So here’s a little more financial background. 

I started building my credit in October with a credit card I use for gas in my car. I have a credit score in the good range, and I’ve heard that to get a house, typical scores should be 720-750 minimum. I’m slowly working my way there and I’m hopeful I’ll be there in a couple years. I’ve never had a late payment on rent or my credit card bills. 

My fiancée hasn’t got a credit card yet, but she’s saving all her money and she’s out of work right now with the pandemic going on, but once she’s got a full time job again, we’ll be putting $2,000 minimum into savings every single month. 

Aside from getting her credit built up, what else should we be doing to prepare to buy a home in the next 7 years?"

My family always tell me to carry less, but I don’t know a reasonable amount. I put a $20 here and there Incase of “emergencies” and I see myself carrying up to roughly $200 which I know is unnecessary.

8616,Start gaining credit,"This has probably been asked before. However I am unable to find another post. I was wondering where a good place to start building credit is when you have zero. I have a great job and wage for being 18 at $22 an hour and average 40-50 hours a week. I would like to take a loan out for around 5k to pay back a loan I have with my father but wouldn’t be apposed to getting a credit card to build credit or another form. I pay all my bills on time and in full, and could handle $300 a month payment comfortably."
8635,Need advice or information with my boyfriend being a first time home owner for his mom,"So, my boyfriend and I are 19 and we’re not looking for a house until our 20s but we might have a problem. I don’t really know much about house owning and everything that goes in to it. I do know if your a first time home owner you get some type of loan. So, the problem is my boyfriends mother currently has townhouse she is renting that my boyfriend,his brother, and his mom live in. His mom has bad credit but she wants my boyfriend to put his name on a house for her to live in, in about a year. 

Background info:
My boyfriend is 19 and he has a job that makes 12.50 an hour. He bought his own new truck and he makes payments on it every month but the truck is under his moms name and his mom gets all the credit for it yet he still has to pay for all the payments. His mom took his old cars money from when he sold it too, instead of giving my boyfriend the money to help pay the car. My boyfriend also pays for pretty much every time they go out to eat or sometimes grocery’s. He pays for his moms electrical bill , their phones bills, water bill, and some other bills. I guess you would say his mom is high maintenance, she always has the money to get her nails done and hair done and shop but not enough for bills. She always wants the high end brands for purses, wallets, jewelry, perfume, etc as gifts from my boyfriend. He does a lot for her no questions asked because that’s his mom but sometimes I feel like it’s too much but it’s not my place to say anything so I do not but in this case I would like to know everything he is getting into and so would he . So, She wants in a year for him to put his name in a house for her to live in because she says her credit is too low and with the credit card he has it will be good by then. She said that she would pay all the bills it’s just his name is on it and if anything happened to him she would get the house. Also his mom works at a bank. 

My question is what would be the the negatives and benefits if my boyfriend puts his name on the house and as a first time buyer. Would it effect when me and him want a house and I want him to be a owner of the house with me. Does that mean we wouldn’t get as much or not at all money for a first time owners house since he would already use that money? He doesn’t really know anything about this stuff and neither do I and I want us to know all the doubts and benefits before he goes through with anything. I am not at all in anyway trying to get him against his mom or whatever by making a decision on the house but his mom might also get mad if he says no without a logical explanation. 
If I anyone can tell me what his responsibilities would be if he went through with it and just any information you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Sorry this is all over the place."
8645,Financing vehicles?,"Hi all, so I'm 29, my fiance is 30. Both of us have only ever bought cheap (&lt;$2000) vehicles out right.  Well my credit isn't really bad anymore (thanks student loans) his is low because he hasn't used credit cards or loans. 
I've done the ""preapproval"" thing that gives an estimate on auto loans without a hard credit inquiry.  
We have been looking for a car for me and a truck for him because both our vehicles are 25+ years old. 
Some questions that I'm not finding clear answers for on google.
Can we use one loan for 2 vehicles? 
Do we need to get 2 separate loans?
What if we buy them both from the same place? 
We aren't looking for anything crazy, just something less than 20 years old, less than 10,000 each so it shouldn't be too bad for payments.  We have enough to put 2,000 down on each vehicle, so in total, we would need less than $16,000 for a loan/loans. 

Please help.
Thanks!"
8691,"Just got a credit card, what should I know about it?","I've always wanted a credit card because I heard that building up your credit score is really important. So without trying to delay further I got one, but no one can really explain (or at least I cant understand) what I should do with it now. Some questions I have:

1) When should I make my payments? I understand that basically my credit card can pay for anything so long as I don't go over my allowed amount, but when should I make these payments to take it off? My gf told me to let payments stay in my account for a while so it can accrue interest and then I pay more which will help my credit score. I told her that I thought I should just pay it off immediately and she suggested against doing that.

2) How much of my allowed amount should I be spending? I am initially allowed a credit line of $1,500, but once again my gf said I never want to spend more than \~30% of what I'm allowed. Spending too much will look bad I guess and so it'll hinder my credit score.

3) Is there a time where I shouldn't be using my credit card? All I've ever known is just using my debt card to pay for everything and that was simple as it was. But now that I have the ability to build credit whenever I can, should I be using my credit card for everything now? Is there no downside to this?

4) Should I have multiple credit cards? If I'm not mistaken I think certain credit cards with certain companies give better value for items sold by them (eg an amazon credit card that gets you like 2% cash back compared to the usual 1%) Can I just go around getting as many credit cards as I want to maximize the value I get out of every business?

5) Does anything happen if I don't use my credit card? Will it go dormant and I can't use it since I'm ""inactive""? Will my credit score drop since I won't be doing anything with it?

Any help is much appreciated and let me know what you learned from having a credit card too! It's an exciting responsibility and I just want to make sure I handle this correctly and not end up in a financial mess.

TL;DR What does an adult do with a credit card? How should I use it?"

I bring home net of 2000-2600 a month with an average being about 2300 after taxes. My lease is up in March and I’m hoping that I can get overtime around Christmas to be able to show a higher income. My credit score is good, 750+, no debt, school and car and credit card are all paid off. 

I am comfortable paying around the amount I am currently paying, but I know that it looks risky to a new apartment complex. I am also considering picking up a side hustle again for a few months to increase income temporarily before I apply for new apartments. 

Not related directly but sort it- but I want to move because I have had roaches in my apartment for over 9 months at this point. I had pest control here twice, but they only come on fridays, and I tend to work every Friday. I have 2 cats and one likes to run when the door is open, and if I’m at work I know I wouldn’t be able to do anything about it. I have considered bringing my own pest control out, they are about 300$ for the first visit then around $100 for each follow up? But then another part of me is like - I’m not doing this for the complex they don’t deserve me spending my money on it. But I’m also not able to be home for pest control coming. 

I don’t know what to do. I want out of here for my next lease so badly. Any help is appreciated"

I can afford to do payments so I was thinking just use a credit card for this, cut it up and pay it off and then delete the account when all is said and done. Is this a bad idea?"
8952,Should I Get A Loan??,"I’m 23 living in my own apartment with a roommate, I have a car almost paid off, and I have a credit card I owe $500 on. I also owe 2k in medical bills. Was really hoping for a stimulus check to help me stop living pay check to pay check. I have a full time job and I make $14 an hour. But I’ve been struggling and I took up door dash for extra money. Should I apply for a loan? A big one just to pay off my medical bills and credit card and then save the rest to help start building up money."

8986,How does paying a credit card work?,"Hello,

I just signed up for a credit card a few days ago. I have a balance of $86 on it at the moment, and the website (discover) says that the next statement closing date is october 11th. When I signed up for the card, I got an email saying the payment due date would be the 6th of each month. 

Can someone explain when/how I am supposed to pay the bill? Is there like a window after I receive the statement for the month that I can pay the total, or am I just supposed to do it at any point before the due date? Also, what is the difference between the payment due date and the statement closing date? 

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!"
8992,How does paying a credit card affect the credit score?,"I'm just trying to figure out what the math behind this is. I'm using capital one credit wise to simulate my credit score if I made a payment on my credit card. What's really confusing me is that if I pay $44 the simulator says my credit will go up one point. If I pay $45 my credit will go up *NINE* points. That makes no sense to me. I'd have to pay $62 to get it up ten points. How is that figured out? 

Obligatory apology for any bad formatting, I'm on mobile"
9075,How can I go from no credit score to ~700 (or any good) credit score? Tell me all about credit scores please!,"Like my other post, I don't know anything about this! I don't know anything about using credit cards (although I do have a debit) nor banking! I've been coddled. I want to build up a good credit score to help me towards a nice apartment! Advice and info needed!"
9131,Getting a credit card/building credit,"I’m 20 years old and I have 1 more year of college left, and I think I should start building credit while I’m still a student. Hopefully I’ll have a full time job secured by graduation, and with that I’d like to have some credit built. I wish I posted this at the start of college, but hey, hopefully it’s not too late.

I have a couple concerns/questions:
Do I need to have a constant source of income to apply for a credit card? I’m currently getting unemployment benefits, so would that count as a source of income?

I really don’t have many hefty monthly purchases like tuition or rent because my parents pay for all of that (which I am incredibly grateful for!) so would it be reasonable to still apply for a credit card when the only things I buy are things like gas &amp; groceries? 

I know some of these questions I could likely find answers in a google search, but it would be awesome to hear anyone’s input on my situation! Any advice or suggestions on banks or types of cards I would greatly appreciate!"
9187,18,Today’s my birthday..officially an adult what do I do now? Apply for a credit card? Start saving for retirement? Save up for a house? Hahaha but seriously what’s your advice?
9197,How best to pay off credit card?,"So I have a low limit on my first card that I’ve had for a year now. Always paid the full balance off, not just the minimum, every month.

I havent been using it much buuut I’ve needed to use the card more lately, so heres the question: 

Whats better, paying just the minimum amount ($25) or paying a little more okay? Is it somehow bad to pay more than the minimum but not the full balance? I’m thinking $50 or $100."
9216,Question about Credit!,"Hey everyone. I’m looking to get a credit card but I’m wondering where your credit starts if you’ve never had a credit card?

Does it start at 0 or...?

I’m a bit late - I’m 22. But I’m just about to finish university finally and get a job and I didn’t want to get a credit card until I actually have an income.

Also do you have any tips about getting good credit? Is it best to pay it off right away?

Thank you!"
9223,I just received my first secured credit card for credit building purposes.,"Backstory: My credit sucks and I maxed out a BofA and a CareCredit card within a few months of each other about 6 years ago in a bad financial situation. They’re in collections, my credit is in the toilet. 

Current sitch: I got approved for a secure CC with a $200 limit. 30% of that is $60. 

So I took my $60 internet bill and set the auto payment to come out of the new secured card. Then I set the secured card monthly payment to auto-deduct from my checking account. Basically a closed loop to credit improvement, I hope. The only thing I have to think about is having enough in my account to cover the CC bill, so I set an alarm on my phone to remind me each month that the bill is coming soon. 

I am 31 and trying to change all the poor habits I created in my 20s. 

TL;DR: bragging about doing basic adult shit."
9240,Trying to move out help,"I’m 19 yrs and I make 9.50/hr. I want to move out bc my grandmother is restricting. I could make more money if I was allowed to make my art and sell it. I’m not allowed to paint in the house, I’m not even allowed to wash my own laundry but I’ve never been taught to adult. I had to wait till I was 18 to get a job and make my own bank acc, I have no idea whether or not I should make a credit card acc.
I do have a car resulting from a series of unfortunate events, it’s under my name and I pay insurance with my sister. I want to find a roommate to move out with but my friends aren’t available for that and I don’t know how to find one. The general rent in my area is 800-1300. I have a small dog, I can’t leave her behind because my grandmother will either neglect her or throw her out. At best give her to my grandfather who would leave her at his chicken farm. I don’t really have anyone helping family wise. My girlfriend of 1 year wants to move out together just not now, later but if I stay in this house I’m going to loose my mind.
She got mad at me a while ago bc I got catching painting a commission, I had to drop the price from 200$ to 120$ bc it’s gonna be a few weeks late since I’m not having any time to finish it. 
My friend’s mom whose the closet person to a mother I have said I could stay with them but it’s a small 3/bedroom 2/bathroom apartment with 5 people already staying there. The oldest sister has autism and has a meltdown everytime a new person comes and stays, she doesn’t want to share her room understandably. And the living room is already being used as a bedroom. Also half of the ppl living there are addicted to weeds and acid. Idk if that’s much better than over here but I’d have more freedom to do more things."
9241,How much will it affect my credit if I close an account?,"I have like 2 sources that affect my credit right now, my rent and my credit card. I moved states though and I’ve kept my credit card open through shared branches, and since it’s the oldest source of credit, I’ve been scared to close that account out of fear my credit score would drop HELLA. 

So how much exactly would it go down? The credit card has been open for less than a year, first used it in Dec, and I’m thinking of just closing the account and getting a bank account up here where I live now."
9249,Should I buy a credit card without a job?,"I’m 22 years old and have no credit card nor job (been unemployed since I graduated this spring). I want to start building credit so I can hopefully move out soon but I have no job. I currently don’t spend any money at all, I only have my savings from working on campus. Now that I’m gone, I have no income at all. Should I wait until I get a job to start building credit?"
9257,How to prepare for an apartment?,"I'm currently 18, I earn $13.62/hr at my job with ebay supplementing (with the help of my dad) and about 3.5k in savings. My plans to move into dorms this year were thwarted my covid, and next year I hope to move into a campus-affiliated apartment instead. Rent is anywhere between $585-$600+ (depending on the room) according to their website, and I'm looking for advice regarding the plausibility of my plan, and how to make it happen.

I currently don't have a credit card, I looked into it but without a cosigner I need to pay $500 for a secured one (the money is returned to my account in a year, it's a security deposit type of deal). I'm not sure if credit is required for the campus housing, but would it help my chances?

How much should I try to boost my savings before then? Obviously as much as possible, but I'm worried because tuition will wipe 2.5k out of my savings this fall and I will very likely require student loans after a quarter or two. What would be a good amount of money to have saved up by next fall?

How else can I prepare myself and make this as likely to happen as possible? I'm aware that it might be impossible, I'm used to working while taking classes though and my family plans to be as financially supportive as they can.

Thanks in advance :)"
9375,Credit,"I (22F) checked my credit score after years, and it’s 524. That’s so bad. I checked the marks and it’s all for collection agencies because of unpaid medical bills when I was living with my parents who didn’t want me to be on their insurance as to not raise their insurance prices, so I was without. I want to pay them off but I don’t know if it’ll raise my credit score at all, I know it stays in your score even after you pay it off for 5+ years, but I’m trying to be more responsible and pay things off as I’m working a steady paying job. My S/O (23M) and I want to move out of his parents soon so we can start our lives, and be responsible. The state I live in here in the US, 99.9% of the decent places around require credit checks. Which, hah, I would be denied instantly. That 1% are what’s to be considered as trap houses with slumlords. Mines garbage because of medical bills, and his is flat out zero. Should I pay them off from 6+ years ago, and get approved for a credit card? Build it up that way? This is definitely a topic they should be teaching in school, had it been more readily available, I wouldn’t be asking the lovely folk of reddit how to adult responsibly 🤦‍♀️"
