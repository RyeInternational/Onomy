180,"There have been many recent threads explaining why everyone needs an emergency fund and why it should never be intermingled with other investments. If you haven’t yet reached that point, saving in a more traditional emergency fund is beneficial. But if you’ve started to accumulate some wealth, you’re better off without an emergency fund. **What is an emergency fund? **The general purpose of an emergency fund or a “rainy day fund” is to ensure you can cover expenses in an unexpected financial emergency, such as job loss or large medical bills. The exact definition of an emergency fund is a bit murky, but there are two generally agreed-upon traits:- Held in cash or highly liquid vehicle such as a checking account, saving account, or money market fund- Able to cover 6-12 months of expensesHolding a traditional emergency fund like this is one way to mitigate financial downside, but it is not optimal. To determine what is optimal, we need to assess the ultimate goal of an emergency fund. Be able to withstand a period of up to a year with no incomeThe first goal should be met through the standard operating cash that you have available, without requiring an emergency fund. This opens many possible solutions, including cash under a mattress, gold buried in your backyard, money in a saving account, or a sizable investment portfolio.Since all of these could meet the goals of an emergency fund, how can we choose which is optimal? **What an Emergency Fund Should Be – Mitigate Risk and Maximize Net Worth**The two previously mentioned goals of an emergency fund relate to reducing downside risk. After the above two goals are met, maximize net worth over timeIf your portfolio is large enough to withstand a significant drop and still cover a year’s expenses, these three goals are best met without a traditional emergency fund. One investor (EF) saved an additional year of expenses in an emergency fund, with returns that equal inflation. The EF investor covered expenses from his emergency fund, and the no-EF investor sold stocks to cover expenses. The EF investor, on the other hand, misses out on this buying opportunity because he spends the next year-and-a-half building back his emergency fund before buying more stock. **Portfolio Size Needed to Forgo an Emergency Fund**Based on this analysis, it is clear that an investor with a large enough portfolio should forgo an emergency fund. If the market drops more than 75%, you likely have bigger societal problems that wouldn’t be solved by any emergency fund.This amount must be available for you to withdraw without penalty. **If you have built a sizable portfolio, you don’t need a separate stash of cash as your emergency fund.",24,2,You don't need an emergency fund if you have a large portfolio,Finance
