(Switzerland, as an expat)Now a new advisor came in, and started reviewing my position, and proposed switching to a more aggressive fund.The existing fund takes 500 CHF (more or less equivalent to USD) a month, and is structured as a life insurance, in case of death or disability (preventing me from earning) it will pay off a pension of around 2000 CHF/ Month. It forecasts a 2.5% to 3% yearly growth.The new fund will be a bit more focused on equity, and as such it is more leaning towards the 4.5/5%, which on the long run translates into almost double forecasted pay off (the rest of the benefits are comparable) we are talking about a forecasted fund value of 400k vs 8-900kI'm 30, so i have 35 years minimum before i get the pay off, the advisor suggests taking an interest loss closing the existing position (being a 40 years insurance, the first years, like mortgages, are mostly paying interests rather than capital)I would add that i currently have around 65% of my net worth invested, i don't own a house, but i have a decent salary and long term prospect, no debt.&amp;#x200B;Any advice is appreciated",2,1,Retirement Fund: worth switching &amp; taking a loss?,Finance
