She'd question why I post anything or who people are and want to control everything - parenting is basically from the 50's like anything that happens in the house stays in the house (even if you want to kill yourself which I have because if this environment)- therapy is for insane people- mental health doesn't exist you're either okay and sane or you have a illegal problem that needs to be locked up (but it's okay for her to have anxiety which no one can say she has just her or shell tell at you)-bizzare weird things that just make me uncomfortable: she think she can just into the bathroom when I'm taking a piss or a shower even if I'm naked and want privacy -she will go to the bathroom if I'm say washing my face even though we have a second one -she keep telling at me to get out if the bathroom because she needs to go even if I do even though we have a second one-shell just be naked like say after a shower and say I'm in the bathroom doing something even though it's not a sight I want to see without warning-she pushes her way into all my doctors and everything appointments and doesn't understand no matter how many times people tell her what patients rights are and I have to have my doctors and what not just straight up lie to her it's that badI've sprinkled examples of her weirdness and how she's abusive and controlling and unsupportive.-------------------------------------------------------------***SOME THINGS ABOUT ME:I have depression and anxiety that have been clinical and even lead me to emergency services and therapy.

They rejected this idea.\- Dad even sometimes accuses me of not contributing (I do, but it's not consistent or of my own accord, they just spring it on me) \- One time, parents demanded money from my savings (they said I'd be getting paid the next day so I could just put it back. )\- I haven't kept a ledger of the money they took from me, but I really should so that they can't tell me I don't contribute.Furthermore, my parents tell me the money they ask of me for bills is just a drop in the bucket compared to what I'd have to pay even living with a roommate, and that roommates are extremely unreliable and will leave me. I would like to try and live on my own so I won't have to deal with this, but I'm afraid my parents might be right, that even living with a roommate (even splitting the rent of a decent apartment with a rent of like 7 or 800 per month) would cost way over $1,000 a month with groceries and whatnot. I don't know how to drive (my parents either haven't wanted to or couldn't teach me how- though my mom is occasionally bringing up taking me out to an empty parking lot so she or my brother could teach me how) and the city bus doesn't go out to where I work. )**Tl;dr:** My financially irresponsible parents ask for money very inconsistently.

A couple other examples is that my parents refuse to buy a washer and dryer and so they go to the laundromat despite having a built in laundormat space in our back porch. Another more extreme example is that when our '98 car was stolen, my parents went two years without buying another car and made me get up at 4am every day before school to drop them off at work just so I had the car to drive to school and pick them up from work after (they def had at least $250 they could have put aside for monthly car payments + insurance).I also come from a South Asian family and typically education is very important in our culture and parents will go through anything to make sure their kids have university covered so I am quite upset that my parents have not helped in any way.
