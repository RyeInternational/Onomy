4938,"If you have a fixed-rate loan, your principal and interest payment will remain set for the life of the loan, which could be as long as 30 years. As part of the home-buying process, you usually will need capital for the down payment, loan fees, closing costs, reserves, and moving expenses. Your capacity is calculated based on your current income, income history, future earning potential, and amount owed, including car payments, student-loan payments, credit card accounts (Visa, MasterCard, etc. Collateral provides the  lender with security on the loan if the borrower defaults (or does not pay the mortgage). Using this as a guideline, a family earning $60,000 a year, would probably qualify for a loan between $150,000 and $200,000. Mortgage lenders often use ratios to determine the maximum loan amount for a borrower. Typically, to be able to qualify for a loan, lenders will have a preset limit between 36 percent and 41 percent. If your loan has a maximum limit of 36 percent, and if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend on your home mortgage plus all other debts, such as car payment, student loan, etc., is $720. If you pay off loans, take care of your credit, and weigh your options carefully, you will be living independently in no time at all.&amp;#x200B; [http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/FCS5/FCS5474/FCS5474.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3WH\_4ITuHsleNv0u3zSl4vMWC6MNyb9jfZspXq7iy\_sVFSx\_ckyLfxsf0](http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/FCS5/FCS5474/FCS5474.pdf?fbclid=IwAR3WH_4ITuHsleNv0u3zSl4vMWC6MNyb9jfZspXq7iy_sVFSx_ckyLfxsf0)  ^(Educational programs of Kentucky Cooperative Extension serve all people regardless of economic or social status and will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, marital status, genetic information, age, veteran status, or physical or mental disability.)",0,1,Moving Out of Your Parents’ Basement: Should You Buy or Rent?,Adult

2749,"**Some Background:**I just re-refinanced my student loans (more on that shortly). I first refinanced about 80,000 in graduate student loans a little over a year ago. When I did so, I dropped my interest rate almost a full 2.5 percent (from a 6.8% variable interest rate down to a 4.09% fixed rate), while also cutting the payment schedule of my loan from about 25 years to 10 years. This refinance also consolidated the “shell game” of paying off multiple student loans (some subsidized, some unsubsidized, some Pell grants, etc.) across four or five different loan service providers, each of whom seemed to change every 6-12 months. In short, this refinance took what was a stressful and confusing and frustrating amount of bookkeeping and organized my loans in a single, much more affordable, and manageable debt.I know that refinancing isn't always the best move for everyone because federal loans have certain protections in place (grace periods, deferment, income-based repayment, etc. Given the tens of thousands of dollars this saved me over the total course of my loan, I feel like this was one of the best financial decisions I ever made. Obviously, research your loans and your loan providers before deciding. I ran price comparisons with 10 different loan companies. Over the course of my loan, that saves me about $5000 (even more if I pay down the principal early). **Life Pro Tip 2: If you like your current loan provider, ask for a rate match**I'll start with a bit of a plug here: after years of terrible student loan providers shuffling my debt around different servicers ever year or so, I was thrilled with the quality and easy-to-use customer service by my new loan provider: SoFi. I was able to speak with a loan representative in less than five minutes and negotiate a match. **Bonus Life Pro Tip 3: Before refinancing with a loan provider, try calling their customer service line to test their wait times. **I learned the hard way early on in my student loan journey that some student loan providers are a pain in the ass. I had a series of nightmares, from a loan company accidentally sending me too much money once (then demanding I send it back as a lump sum) to another company accidentally putting my loan into repayment while I was enrolled as a full-time student (this impacted my credit and I had to have my state’s attorney general’s office intervene to get all of this sorted out; it was a mess), or another loan company initially denying me a grace period when I finished college (probably because the other company put my loan into repayment when they were not supposed to), or giving me incorrect start dates for my payments-- due to confusions about the grace period laws-- then demand payment earlier than initially quoted. I couldn't afford a lawyer, and I'm not sure if one would have been helpful, but I ran into a huge amount of headaches caused by evil and/or incompetent loan companies looking for ways to hit me with late fees. ), I would have been in serious trouble.Probably the most frequent frustration of all was that my loans kept changing service providers with minimal notice. Because I never had a clear sense of who owned my loans or whom I should call whenever I ran into problems like those above, all of this felt like a shell game. Whenever I tried calling a company to ask for help, I typically had to wait 20-30 minutes on hold before speaking to a customer service representative, only to find that they had shuffled my loan off to a different company.When I was started shopping for student loan refinance companies last year, I looked at rate comparisons first, then I tried calling the customer service lines for the top two or three offers. I intentionally tried to call lines there were intended to offer support for existing loans, and not support lines catered to sales/refinancing, because I know some companies might prioritize sales and neglect existing customer support (An inverse trick I learned during the ""shell games"" I talked about earlier: if you call a company's sales line, you might reach a support person faster.

And I'm hating myself for being financially illiterate at the time.I'm sitting here painfully regretting the money I left on the table in student loans. So I received max pell grant, along with plenty of other school wide grants including a $500 a month stipend for up to six years for a first generation grant.As a black man and first generation student, I was always taught that loans were bad and stay away from them unless you really really needed it. (I can't blame those that told me this) But that wasn't the absolute best advice.I did end up having to take out about 14k in loans (even that was begrudgingly at the time) to finance myself through college as I had no financial support from my Mom whatsoever.But now that I look back on college, I realized I will never in my life have that much access to capital without being exposed to interest for such a long period, in my life. I ended up leaving about 15-20k in loans on the table. Truth be told it would be more, because you could apply for additional loans through the school that would have not been due until after graduation.It's water under the bridge now, but in the event my children do not need their loans to live or pay for school I will convince them to take them and at the very least, put them in an index and let it sit for 4-5 years while you're in school. Pull it out pay the loans back, and they'd have themselves a nice little 2-3k graduation present.

10478,"In the past, SEC staff guidance required that funds recall shares they loaned when material items were on the ballot to ensure that voting would occur.&gt;We show that after the new guidance, funds dramatically increased share lending. Specifically, we show that for stocks with high index fund ownership – those having the strongest economic incentive to try to earn additional lending fees – the supply of shares on loan increases from 15.6 percent to 22.3 percent. Because shares can be borrowed at-will from the lending agent or broker, and then voted by the ultimate holder as of the record date, shares put on loan do not carry voting instructions. Hence, shares made available for loan but not borrowed are not voted – making share lending a significant contributor to non-voting. By one estimate, in 2010 alone, 60 billion shares went unvoted, with 15 billion shares on loan.&gt;With no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. This was possible because nearly 40 percent of GameStop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.&gt;Our evidence supports the hypothesis that funds face a lending-voting dilemma, which speaks to their incentive problems.",8,1,The Index-Fund Dilemma: An Empirical Study of the Lending-Voting Tradeoff,Finance

What Happened: The DFC is the federal agency that originally granted the loan. last week.Zakel told Warren, who has been among the most vocal critic of what she earlier referred to as a “massive fiasco of a deal,” that the DFC in its review found no conflict of interest for the employees of the federal agency in the deal and that there is no “evidence of misconduct on the part of DFC officials.”The loan was sanctioned at the behest of President Donald Trump in July this year.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has also been reportedly probing the events surrounding around the loan, including allegations of potential insider trading violations.A DFC spokesperson told the Journal, “the record is abundantly clear and the independent IG review confirms that DFC followed its standard process, under its standard timeline, driven by career finance professionals.”Why Does It Matter: It isn't immediately clear if DFC will go forward with the loan.One of Warren's aide claimed that Zakel's assessment didn't look into potential ties between the White House and other related parties with a political background. The associate also raised certain questions about the DFC’s procedures.Zakel said the DFC limited the probe internally and “did not review conduct by Kodak or non-DFC personnel.“Kodak shares have seen immense volatility since the announcement of the loan in July. Grant of stock options to Kodak Chairman and CEO Jim Continenza a day before the loan was announced, along with his purchase of a significant amount of shares in the company ahead of the loan raised eyebrows. An independent committee appointed by Kodak board in September concluded there was no violation of the law on part of the Rochester-based photography company but it flagged concerns related to corporate governance.Continenza said in October that Kodak will move forward with the generic drug ingredients manufacturing venture even if the federal loan is not granted.",8,1,"Kodak $765M Federal Loan Process Involved No Wrongdoing, DFC Concludes",Finance

The rep over the phone insisted that this was normal, and that to proceed, I would need to send them a quote from a dealer to actually receive the loan. Something wasn't right.Fast forward a week, and I call the again to ask about them providing me some sort of document of any kind showing the loan approval terms, and this rep also insisted it was normal.After that call, I googled ""DCU Auto Loan Check"" which resulted in [this page from DCU's website](https://www.dcu.org/borrow/vehicle-loans/AutoLoanCheck.html), stating that I could request an actual check for the loan that I can bring to a dealer. They also said that my online banking account should indicate the loan status. But when I log into my online banking account, there is NO INDICATION of any loan applications or approvals even pending. So basically it seems that I have a DCU auto loan approval floating out there, as well as a required DCU account, but DCU doesn't seem to recognize that they are connected. BoA approved a loan for me at 2.84% and even though it's higher I'm going to have to go with it because I just don't trust DCU to not fuck something up when it comes to my money.",1,1,DCU/Auto Loan Problems,Finance

Despite this, my old vehicle still has something like $6,000 in debt on the original loan, as well as a few small credit card bills I'd like to wipe out.I'd planned to sell the older vehicle, as I don't need the extra costs associated with it anyways and the funds would cover the majority of my debt, allowing me to pay off the full amount within the year while dropping my monthly payments by a fair bit. It's a lot easier to sell a car without a lien on it, so my thought process was to go ahead and get a debt consolidation loan, pay off the car and my other debts, and then sell the car and use that money to pay off the consolidation loan.Now I know there are fees and other processing costs included in an loan, but I'm confused as to how APR (and the total cost of the loan overall) is affected if I were to pay off a loan before its intended lifespan.Say that I took out a $6000 loan today, and I paid it off the very next month, would I be charged anything at all beyond processing fees? Or is the loan's total amount determined based on the ASSUMPTION that you're going to keep the loan for its full length.That is to say, is APR% factored into the total cost of the loan from the moment you open said loan, and you **will** pay that percentage regardless of how quickly you pay it?

I'd only be saving like $6,000 over the life of the loan, but I guess that's still a decent amount.We need about $36,000, which I could take out ""in cash"" (we're planning on re-siding the house, possibly getting six large trees removed, some other big expenses), it would be slightly less than what I'm paying now, $963/month, but over 30 years that ends up being $346,680, which is $63,000 more than if I refinanced with no cash back. Basically comes out to an even $27,000 in interest over the lifetime of the loan for just this extra amount.So I guess what I'm wondering is if it would be better to do no cash refinance and then take out a $36,000 loan for a shorter term (but likely higher percentage) elsewhere instead. Like even at the current ""average"" rate (5.77%), a 10 year home equity loan for $36,000 would only end up being a total of $47,463 (rather than $63,000) and $396/month.

It seems like we would save about $15,500 over the 30 years if a 10 year HE loan was an option, but would end up paying $100/month more than what we are currently paying and would have to wait a decade to see the benefits of refinancing show up in our monthly payments.And then obviously if we could get a HE loan for less than 5.7%, the saving would be even bigger.Been in house 6 years and plan to stay for foreseeable future.",2,1,Refinance with Cash Out now?

4898,"My mother decided to loan me an interest-free family loan to  be nice, and because she knows I've been burdened with credit card debt for years due to surviving through school, studying abroad, and then a year long internship. The loan comes to about 25,000, and it is an interest-free term loan that is 5 years long, for about just under $400 a month. It looked like people try to use loans to get around the gift taxes and annual/lifetime limits, so it was less problematic to consider something a gift over a loan. Now that may not be the case from my research, and I don't want to inadvertently commit a grave error on my mother's taxes.Questions I have now:1) If we do an interest free intra family loan, would she owe both the imputed interest as income on her taxes, AND consider the foregone taxes a gift? Or is it either one?2) If the forgone interest is a gift would I calculate the entire loan ($25,000) as the metric for what qualifies as the $15,000 yearly maximum that needs to be reported if exceeded, or just the imputed interest on it (which I have not calculated), say, the imaginary $500 I am using for purposes of an example? 3) And if it is only the imputed interest flagged as a gift (the imaginary $500 I'm using for reference), that means if it is under $15,000 (as it most definitely will be) that she doesn't even need to file a Form 709 or otherwise mention it on her taxes?4) If the gift option on the calculated imputed interest is correct, would this be something she would need to calculate yearly on a term loan? One was any loan under $10,000, which was except from imputed taxes. Mine is over, although I deeply regret not having her pay half and half over two years, since it was about that time anyway!The second I do qualify for I am certain: &gt;  if the aggregate outstanding amount of gift loans between individuals does not exceed $100,000, the imputed interest amount for income tax purposes is limited to the borrower’s net investment income for the year. Does this mean if I have less than $1000 investment income over 2020 (from my understanding I most definitely do not exceed that), and my loan is under $100,000, then my mother would not owe any imputed interest on this loan?6) And if that is true, would she need to even bother gifting any of the foregone taxes to me, and worry about the $15,000 annual maximums and lifetime limits and possible Form 709 ramifications?If that is the case, it seems weird that intrafamily loans would be talked about in such hushed, worried tones on all the financial sites I read, as most people looking for an intrafamily loan would not fall into that category. If so, or if not, does she need to label any of this ALSO as a gift, either the entire loaned amount or the foregone interest? If it is under the limits for either gift taxes or loan requirements, does she even need to mention it on any form as income or a gift? And as I have under $1000 investment income and the loan is under $100,000 are we fully exempt from all of this confusion anyway, and would she need to reflect this on her taxes in some way, even if it is handwave it away as taxable?Bonus question: Since she is excusing payments for 4 months after paying it out over about a month's time, will we need to consider these 4 months of waved payments a gift, assuming we are not exempted from this concern due to the $100,000/$1000 net investment income exception?",0,1,"Intrafamily Loan questions: after reading dozens of older threads on this, and general online guidance, I am still confused",Finance

My question here is on the two $7000 federal loans, the added amount is about $600 in interest and that is going to capitalize. Thankfully the covid stuff happening has put a pause on those loans entering repayment, but I’m wondering if it’s just worth it to pay off the interest now to not have it capitalize, or if it’s better to just put that $600 into paying off the higher interest loan as a lump sum. I’m already paying about $100 more into the discover loans to pay it off faster, because I hadn’t realized it was a 15 year loan and I don’t want it to go past ten, and hoping to bring it down much faster as well. I just don’t know if that $600 is even worth worrying about even if it capitalizes when I have loans with double the interest rate.I haven’t done anything with the federal loans because I don’t know what will happen with debt forgiveness or how long the debt moratorium is going to last, but the private is the most important right now because that is in repayment.Should I just not worry about the capitalizing interest and just keep paying off the higher rate loans first?",12,1,Ignore capitalization on some loans?,Finance

6490,"I've previously attended a private university (and taken out $7k in federal loans), then community college (for free with a Pell grant) and now my current university, where I enrolled last Fall at the insistence of my family. I'm currently only paying a little bit (\~$300/semester) because I'm living at home and attending remotely and everything is covered by grants, but I'll have to take out max federal loans ($5,500) and will have about $2k left to pay after I move on-campus. However, I didn't get much aid to the schools that I applied to after I attended cc except for a few, where I would have paid $10-15k after grants and federal loans. I would have been happy to take that money out in the form of a private loan because I so badly wanted to go to those schools, but I had no idea what a private student loan would have looked like. I'm very cautious about getting a loan, because I've seen how it affects people after they finish school. I made a post on College Confidential about a year ago asking about financial aid for transfer students, and a few people replied saying that it would be very difficult for me to qualify for a student loan without a cosigner. My family is low-income and don't want me taking out a loan, so I didn't think they would want to cosign for me, plus I have a credit score of 745, so I assumed I could qualify for a loan myself. Can I qualify for a private student loan without a cosigner?

7022,"I'm going to include all the details I think are important, so sorry for this being so long.Financial overview: I went to a small private college to get my Bachelor's and accumulated ~$33k in student loans. I had one private loan that I paid off first, and have since been working on my federal loans. I currently have 4 federal loans (previously 5; one paid off entirely) with the following balances/rates: $4k@4.1%, $4k@3.61%, $3k@6.55%, $2k@3.15%. I put all extra payments towards the 6.55% loan. For the past 7 months, since federal loans currently have no interest, I've been putting my monthly would-be payment into a HYSA (0.5%APR) instead with the plan of making a lump-sum payment before interest is set to accrue again...and with pipedreams of loan forgiveness, which I know is incredibly unlikely. I've been keeping track of what portion of my savings is intended for my loans.I had been driving a 20+ year old car until I bought a new one in 2019. The only debt I have are my auto and student loans.I've got around $11k in savings, which includes about $3k earmarked for student loans. My current monthly base take-home pay is ~$2,400 with base expenses (rent, car insurance, car payment, student loans, utilities, etc.) My first instinct is to put that earmarked $3k and maybe a little more towards my student loans, but then I question whether I should prioritize saving for the cost of a home/downpayment. I'm already slated to pay off my student loans about 2 years early, and I know I could just keep making my monthly payment once 0% interest stops, no harm no foul, the loans will still be there after I buy a house. I could also just pay the $3k loan @6.55% which would bring my average interest rate for the rest to 3.85%, which isn't terrible. I also feel like this is the best time to attack my loans since there is no interest and I would still have enough in my savings for an emergency fund and a small amount to put towards the house, but I'd really like to have more in my savings. It's not like my student loans have crazy high interest rates, so the yearly interest isn't costing me a fortune, but I know the longer I take to pay off the loans, the more money I'm losing in the long run.Any advice about what I should prioritize or maybe an alternate strategy I haven't thought of would be MUCH appreciated.",91,1,The age-old question: Should I focus on paying off student loans or saving for a house?

9089,"Debt: $14,200 Student loans @ 3.5 - 4.0% interest rates	Savings: $36,600	Credit Rating: 770, ( transunion / equifax, pulled from creditkarma ) only negative impacts being the remaining student loans and their respective agesI am wanting to figure out the different paths that I could take to progress forward on my goal to becoming a home owner.Either I purchase a home now and take a considerable risk to get it done now with no financial safety net, or I get an apartment and bide time to build up a financial safety net before purchasing.I have been trying to do shitty math to determine what my best course of action is.I looked up mortgage interest rates and the best that I have seen are as follows:	1.875 @ 15 years fixed	2.25  @ 30 years fixedBoth of these assume a loan amount of $400k and a down payment of 3%.I understand that I will likely be required to carry PMI for the duration of 20% of the loans so long as I do not have a proper down payment.I started exploring the numbers using mortgage calculators.Assuming PMI @ $200 a month until 20% of loan has been paid off. 1.875  @ 15 years fixed			Loan Amount: $400,000		Mortgage Period: 15 years		Interest Rate: 1.875%		Total Cost of Mortgage: $459,194		Monthly Payments: $2,551		PMI Payments: $6,400		Total Mortgage + PMI: $465,594	2.25  @ 30 years fixed			Loan Amount: $400,000		Mortgage Period: 30 years		Interest Rate: 2.25%		Total Cost of Mortgage: $550,434		Monthly Payments: $1,529		PMI Payments: $10,600		Total Mortgage + PMI: $561,034								Just looking at the differences in the loans, it seems at first glance that the shorter duration is favorable just due to the shorter term and not allowing the interest to snowball.But since these interest rates are so low to begin with, does it even make sense to aggressively pay down the loan, or does it make more sense to milk it for as long as possible and sink the money elsewhere?The difference in monthly payments between the loans gives us some theoretical money to play with to throw into an investing calculator and compare the results.$2,551 - $1,529 = $1,022Lets pretend that we put that difference into an account on the market and continue to add the difference in each month. Starting Amount: $1022	Additional Monthly Contributions: $1022	Period: 15 years	Return Rate: 6%	End Balance: $295,673	Total Interest: $110,691				Starting Amount: $1022	Additional Monthly Contributions: $1022	Period: 30 years	Return Rate: 2%	End Balance: $503,922	Total Interest: $134,980The total costs of the loans differ by $95,440. It seems as though as long as I could average a 6% return rate then this would make sense over a 15 year period, or average a 2% return over a 30 year period to match the length of the longer loan. I would love to know peoples thoughts on whether this makes sense or I am going batshit crazy.It seems to make sense that as long as the market return rate interest percentage is nominally higher than the home loan interest percentage, it would make sense that there are better places to shove my money than to dedicate to paying off the home loan as soon as possible.It seems as though a lot, if not all, of the interest accrued yearly on a home loan can be deducted from my taxes. Looking at you solar.Am I correct in thinking this?I would love to get to know your thoughts on the situation that I am in, and also the shitty math and elementary investment theory that i have been toying with.The monthly cost of getting an apartment in my area will be roughly between the monthly expenses presented by the two loan options that I have presented.This, combined with the fact that I will still not be happy with my living situation in a new apartment, have led me to aggressively explore the options available to me that might result in me not getting an apartment.I understand that I may be in a financial situation where an apartment is an unavoidable choice forced upon me by my lack of downpayment and financial security blanket.",5,1,Need help sifting through all of the things to consider when comparing buying a home vs renting,Finance

9127,"I purchased a home a few months ago in Houston with an FHA loan. During the underwriting process I was worried that I would not get approved because of my student loans since the FHA guidelines do not allow for income-based student loan repayment plans (IBR) to be used. I attended graduate school, so my student loans are quite high and FHA wanted to use 1% of the balance and add it to my monthly debt-to-income ratio, which would not have allowed me to qualify for the house I wanted. A loan officer at my mortgage lending company said that if I could get an estimate letter from my student loan servicer stating what the monthly fully amortized payment would be on a standard extended plan (about 0.5% of the balance), I would qualify. So I did all of this, got approved, closed on the house, and moved in.I guess my file was reviewed by FHA and now I’m being told by my loan officer that I need a letter of the actual monthly payment, not the estimated payment, or else they may call the note due. Because my student loan servicer can only provide a copy of the IBR repayment amount since that is the plan I am currently on, which FHA does not allow for. I tried contacting my student loan servicer to officially switch over into the standard extended repayment plan and was told that I cannot do this yet since I only made 1 payment (I consolidated my loans earlier in the year) before the COVID-19 pandemic hit and my loans were put into automatic forbearance.I’m so confused about how I was able to close on the house to begin with if there are issues and what happens moving forward.

I also applied to DCU and while I got a loan approved, I couldn't get an account approved because despite my report on ChexSystems being completely clean, my qualifying score wasn't high enough. I also applied to PenFed and had an account approved but couldn't get a loan approved because the average age of my accounts wasn't high enough. They said I could get the loan with a co-signer but I do not have a co-signer.This was my first time trying to get an auto loan and join a credit union and I didn't know every one of them had such different rules on auto loans for my situation. I applied for a loan, got pre-approved at 2.8% (lowest used rate) and later applied for membership. After I applied for membership, my fear that I might be denied due to all of the ChexSystems inquiries from my previous loan applications came true. My current bank is Bank of America who also offers auto loans. I've been pre-approved and I'm positive I can easily get my private party loan from them without any major issues. Remember that one credit union that I said would work with my conditions but requires me to be a member for 6 months to do of state loans? They specifically told me if I get another loan elsewhere I can refinance with them after 6 months. They approved membership so now I'm in a credit union, who originally offered 2.6%, and can take up my loan from Bank of America after 6 months.",3,1,"I'm having trouble getting an auto loan from a credit union, should I take the high interest loan from my bank and refinance later?",Finance

I am really overwhelmed about where to start and trying to navigate the legal landscape and avoid the numerous scams that are out there.I have recently found myself motivated to find where I can save costs in my finances, and was hoping to get some insight or feedback that might help with my student loan situation. I was young and simply ignored the truth of taking out a loan like this and what it actually meant financially until now. Admittedly, I am ashamed it took me this long to take a serious look at doing something about it, but here I am.I understand that I took out the loans and should have been responsible enough to understand what that entailed, but I was young, gullible, and quite frankly misled by a system that absolutely should not have been allowed to operate this way. That said, I am looking for advice and insight into any ways that I could possibly still get this loan forgiven based on the information provided below. I am currently looking into refinance options to lower the interest rate and get the loan under my name instead of my father’s (God forbid something happens to me and he is stuck paying off the balance).In the case of refinancing I'm looking at some of these options:* Using my 401k to pay off the balance* Refinance my mortgage and roll the student loan into that* Personal loan with lower interest rate* Breaking into my emergency fund - something I'd rather not do.The school was The Art Institutes International Minnesota.Loan Details (Not including the smaller one that was under my name I have since paid off):* Navient (Previously Sallie Mae) Parent Plus loan (FFELP) at 8.125% interest (Under my father’s name). I am still not clear if this is considered a private or federal loan. * Original loan disbursement in 2007 was $45,000* Now, 14 years later, the balance is at $36,000* I’ve currently paid well over the original loan balance with less than $10,000 being put towards the principal.The Art Institutes fraud and lawsuit:* Closed a number of schools including the one I attended* Lied about accreditation* Misled my father and I about the parent plus loan. I ended up finding a job in my field on my own.From my understanding I do not qualify for the two main ways to discharge the loans.1. The Borrower’s Defense Against Repayment Program - Not eligible because it is a Parent Plus loan.2. The Closed School Student Loan Discharge Program - Not eligible because I graduated well before the school was closed.In Summary:If I continue the way things are currently, I will essentially end up paying well over six figures on a $45,000 loan for a school that was sued, lied, and is no longer open.

I bought the car 1.5 years ago and 0.5 years ago I came to the conclusion that I really don't need a \~10k car with a loan behind it. I could've done everything with my old car that had no loan. I could pay the loan until December 2021 so this year. I could just sell the car, pay off my loan and still leave me with 3000 EUROS but I'm the kind of guy who needs a car for his travels, groceries etc. I could just sell the car, pay of 14 000 RON of my 24 000 RON loan and buy a car that would fit my needs with about 5000 EUROS. That would also mean a downgrade of car's year and comfort but I'll be with a 10 000 RON loan that could be paid much faster and with a cheaper car that could be actually okay with what I need from a car. I'm thinking of going in for a 60-65 000 euros loan for a 2-bedroom apartment that would lead me to a monthly ""rent"" (to the bank but theoretically to myself) of \~300 EUR for a 30 years plan and a down payment of 9900 EUROS.",0,1,Advice regarding further financial decisions,Finance

21799,"How Does the Deduction Change for Federal Borrowers This Year?More that 35 million federal student loan borrowers have been in an interest-free forbearance period since mid-March. The value of the student loan interest deduction this year will be a lot smaller for most of those borrowers.Instead of claiming the total interest paid over a 12-month period, most borrowers have only paid interest for January, February and the beginning of March, before the CARES Act set interest rates to 0%.There are still plenty of people who can claim the full interest deduction this year. There are millions of borrowers with private student loans who weren’t granted any relief on their interest rates this year, though some may have gotten temporary hardship forbearances from their lenders.There are also millions of borrowers with older federal loans that did not qualify for the relief in the CARES Act. That includes borrowers in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program, through which the government backed loans that are actually owned by commercial lenders, and those with Perkins Loans, some of which are owned by colleges.There are also income cutoffs to qualify for the maximum value of the deduction. )Loans that count toward the deduction include any loan used to pay for an eligible student (you, a spouse or a dependent) for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, and room and board, at an eligible institution.Finally, there are a few other stipulations to be able to claim this deduction, including that your filing status isn’t married filing separately and that you can’t be claimed as a dependent on another person’s taxes. You also can’t claim the deduction for payments you made on someone else’s behalf (like a parent helping a child pay off debt).Since this is a deduction as opposed to a tax credit (which reduces your tax bill dollar-for-dollar) it takes a little math to figure out how much the deduction is actually worth.The maximum benefit from the student loan interest deduction is $550 this year, but the average amount — even in a typical year — is smaller. The average deduction is about $1,000 according to IRS data, which suggests that the average benefit is around $200, says Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of Savingforcollege.com.The value of the deduction depends both on how much a borrower earns and how much interest they’re paying on their loans. Say a borrower has the average student loan balance of about $37,500 at 5% interest and is on a 10-year repayment plan.

The two are with discover:$7968 @ 6.615% variable$7768 @ 8.365% variable My monthly payment is set at 147 dollars together, as it’s a 15 year loan. I’m not doing anything with federal loans yet as the moratorium is pushed till September, so I’m going to use the time to attack the other loans. I have a well funded emergency fund, and separate to that have another savings account with about the same amount as that higher interest loan. I think I’m definitely going to pay off that second loan because I can just get rid of it and not have to worry about the high interest rate. However, I checked credible.com and was able to get pre-approved for a refinancing loan through PenFed for 3.35% variable for five years and RISLA at 3.65% fixed, also five years. If I were to pay off the second loan and just refinance the first loan, it would put me down to five years with the same monthly payment I’m paying now, $148 and substantially save me on interest. I could also use the money I have budgeted monthly for my federal loans, about 300 or so, and put that towards the refinanced loan as well to save on even more interest, but at the end of the day, even with the minimums for five years, I would only owe $700 or so on the $8000 which seems like a great deal. I’ve been looking into investing and general advice has been don’t invest when you have debt more than 4%, and before, both loans were above that. Well now, one loan will be gone and the other will be at 3.7%. I am trying to keep my credit free of as many hits as possible, but the two hard checks I have now drop off in June of this year from my last student loan check and last credit card.

I have about $350 allocated towards other student loans but that won’t do anything until September, and I don’t want to do anything with them before any debt resolution stuff is or isn’t announced.
