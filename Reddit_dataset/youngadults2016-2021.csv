My study looks at the relationship between individual differences (personality etc) and relational bullying; a specific subtype of bullying that focuses on peer groups and social standing. Basically, this is a really understudied area of research, and before useful intervention and prevention methods can be made, more information on what may cause someone to be involved in this type of bullying needs to be gathered.

I have left the link to the study below, and would really appreciate if anyone with 20 minutes to spare, and any interest in the project would take the time to fill out my questionnaire. You do have to be 16+ in order to fill it out, but if you're under that age and you're interested/have any questions please let me know and I'll be happy to help out in any way I can!

My dad has a history of showing his feelings in strange ways. He's not very emotional.
Just recently he did something he's done multiple times in the past. Today, my mom asked him if he could go to the store and pick something up for her. She went online and printed out an image and details of the item she wanted, even circling the main details to pay attention to when looking for it. About an hour later he came back home with the completely wrong thing. If the store didn't carry it he could have just come home and told her, right? (He refuses to use a cellphone because he feels he doesn't need one and that it would be a waste of money). He went back out to find the right one.

He does this all the time. My mom will give him a list of what we need and will give details like the brand, price, color and specifics. He'll usually bring back everything correct except for one or two things. I get that he's human, but it seems like he's doing it on purpose, especially with my mom.

My mom can be picky about things and wants exactly what she wants. When my dad comes home with something different my mom kind of goes berserk. This usually puts my dad in a bad mood.

The reason I think he does it on purpose is because he'll bring home the wrong thing, get called out on it, get really pissed off about it, and then go back out and get the right thing. Why didn't he get it right the first time?
I totally understand how human error might be the main factor here. He's only human. Maybe he didn't see it in the store the first time around. It happens.

I've also ruled out dementia because my dad (M/57) is mentally/cognitively present and alert.

I'm also wondering if anyone else has experienced this with a dad or significant other in their life?",youngadults,Is My Dad Doing This Out of Spite?,

fast forward a few months, i have been dating this guy despite my parents' disapproval but they did not know about it. we keep to what we should do and never cross the line, we did not have sex and are both saving it for marriage. i tried my best to conceal this rs and to not bring him up too often cos my parents just doesnt like him the slightest bit. whats worst is whenever i quarrel with my parents, they always think that it is this guy that led me astray (since we hang out almost everyday). i honestly do not know why they like to blame my behaviour on him when he didnt even influence me in any way. my parents no longer think it is truly my opinion like as if i dont have a brain anymore. they also tend to think that hes pampering me too much by standing at my side and this is why i dare to rebutt them. 

i have always been respectful and loving towards my parents. but the past few months have been full of ups and downs and many a times my parents and i dont see eye to eye anymore. whenever i give in, i know that i dontt truly think im at fault. whenever i lash out at them, they will bring my bf into the picture and say bad things about him. 

my parents will never allow us to date so im sort of in a rs that has close to 0 chance of a good ending. i want to get to know him more so i wont have regrets in the future. but my parents are making it so tough on me. and sometimes when i feel really sad i realised only my bf is on my side.

i dont know what to do anymore. ",youngadults,i feel so suffocated and full of grudge,

I didn't drop out of school because I was giving up.
I dropped out because I didn't want to give up.
I needed a reason to live, and working/studying full-time wasn't it.
I dropped out because I wanted to be happy.
So, before you tell me I need a degree to be happy, look at the scars on my wrist.
Before you tell me I need a degree to be successful, tell me the last time your interviewer told you that your experience with dogs was enough to boost your starting wage by 10%.
Before you tell me I need a degree to have the best life possible, look at the life I've built for myself. Those scars are healed now. I'm no longer walking the line set before me, but drawing my own, full of bumps and curves and edges. I'm writing my own story. I'm building my own future--the future I want for myself.
Before you tell me I need a degree, realize that I am happy now.
I get paid to help dogs go to good homes.
I get to be home with my two four-legged kids every evening.
I get to cuddle up with my loving boyfriend every night.
I have a purpose.
I have a reason to get up in the morning.
I. Am. Happy.

- Making a move but... you know... ""Don't shit..."" 'n all that.

They often make comments about how I hardly ever see them anymore or they wish we could hang out more often. I think I spend as much time as physically possible with them for someone my age.

I mean I feel like high schoolers now are still so far removed from actually launching careers and being fully financially independent adults...in today's world.

In my case I finished undergraduate years ago and have a job but its the same kind of job that used to be available to high school students meaning I still need to live with my parents and am a far cry from being a truly independent adult.

Right now I'm working towards getting accepted into graduate school and it seems doubtful that I truly be close to financial independence until I finish my graduate degree and can start a real career...

So given all of these facts are high school students really ""almost"" adults when you think about the fact that they still have about 10 years left after finishing high school before they're likely to actually move out of their parents' house for good and be truly self supporting?

He offers to let me smoke some weed in his apartment and I accept. So afterwards as I’m starting to drive home I realize I am *very high.* This wasn’t my first time driving high but I’d never felt impaired driving until this point. So before I enter the highway I decide I should really pull over because I don’t want to cause an accident.

I pull into a Walmart parking lot and sit in my car. I thought maybe I just needed to catch a breath because I was at work all day, but my anxiety only grew worse, to the point where I saw driving as the worst option. I started to get anxious that people in the parking lot thought I was suspicious for sitting there and I had to do something. I was fixing to call my parents to pick me up and drive me home, but I didn’t want to do that. I decided I needed to call a friend who was important to me. So I text my best friend asking them to call me, get out of my car, and start walking towards the Walmart. Within minutes she calls me and I’m telling her I’m having a panic attack and am too high to drive and don’t know what to do. She reassures me and explains that she’s been in that situation, and that I need to relax then try to drive home. 

So I get back in my car, feeling better because I talked to my friend, and drive home. As soon as I get on the highway I realized I was driving normally, just a bit slower but still above the speed limit, staying in my lane and keeping aware of the people around me. I was paranoid about this one car I thought was following me but the eventually passed me and the feeling subsided. I pulled into my driveway. I was home, safe. I texted my friend that I made it and thanked her for helping me. 

But as soon as I shut the door to my room and fixed to put on some music, some more anxiety began to surface. Often if I smoke alone I get trapped in these fears that I’m having a heart attack, or I’m sick or dying and it’s really hard to break from it. So I go to the bathroom, wash my face and look in the mirror. As I’m staring at myself I sort of have an epiphany that all these negative things I think of myself are bullshit. I’m not ugly like I think I am, I’m not some weirdo. I managed to see myself in a positive light for the first time in years. It was like I was seeing a brand new version of myself. Normally epiphanies like this would be gone the next day but I truly feel changed by the experience. 

Anyways, that was my rollercoaster of a night and just wanted to share it. Aside from learning to see myself in a positive way, I also learned that I should never attempt to drive high again.",youngadults,Had the worst panic attack in a while but I fought it.,0.0

He keep saying a version of “ No , let me help , a girl should have to carry this stuff. I can do it for you.” At this point I don’t know if this guy is just trying the help her out or not but it seems a little sketchy to me and the girl looks a little stress and uncomfortable.

I take the suit case from him and I walk with the girl to the parking lot to make sure he doesn’t follow her. When we hit the parking lot I gave her back the case and apologized If I read the situation wrong but she looked nervous .

A lot of newer pop culture just don’t seem to make me excited anymore, or I’m just not interested. A lot of trends that I see kids jumping on seem stupid to me. Before it was like ‘oh man Instagram’s the new craze, iPhone 5’s with color, wow, that seems new and cool! Forever young!’ And now I don’t even use social media most of the time, new stuff seems stupid more times than not, and I can’t get into the stuff kids are so easily getting into, nor do I want to. The last craze I was a part of was Pokemon Go but even then it got boring after a while, the trend died down, I felt like I was growing out of trends.

I felt more connected with people back then, around middle and high school. [Cazzette - Beam Me Up](https://youtu.be/mp-IZEFqrG0) and that’s the kind of feeling I remember around that time. Nowadays, everything seems more isolated than ever. In the beginning of high school, I felt like high school and college students were more in-tune and functioned more like ‘real adults.’ Maybe it’s because our generation was less sheltered and have had more shared experiences.

Now I look at someone even one year younger than me and I see a kid. I’m about to start college, and looking at today’s high schoolers, all I’m seeing are kids that aren’t ready for the ‘real world’ by a landslide, who are totally on a different stage of life than in- and out- of college adults.

Most if the time I feel like despite everything I’ve been given, there’s nowhere else to go and I’m destined for failure, based on the way things are set up right now, and things won’t get any better for the next 20 years. Also being young used to be fun, but now it’s just something I have to go through before I can die. I wish I could go back to feeling alive, like I do whenever I watch that video, or back to the days when I’d game all day one moment, then have an amazing day with my old friends the next, or would randomly meet other young, older people when going places and it would be so easy to make friends instead of everyone being constantly wary of each other.",youngadults,Is anyone else feeling like a washed up boomer trapped inside a young adult body?,0.0

Maybe it's just me, but I think my best years are ahead of me. I don't think my childhood was bad; I actually think it was pretty nice as far as childhoods go, but my memory of it is sort of tainted by me realizing how sheltered and indoctrinated I was.

 Now I have the opportunity to move out, make my own choices, and be truly independent. I know it's going to be hard. I'll have even more responsibilities, I won't exactly be financially secure until I pay off my student loan debt, and I'll probably be living in worse conditions than I am right now. (I'm living with my parents doing school online this semester).

Overall, though, I'm looking forward to (hopefully) becoming a more mature, independent person.

I understand why people dislike organised religion but I do not understand why people have some void in their brain they have to fill with nonsense. And it is nonsense.

I don’t think this trend is harmless. It encourages the mindset that the way the world actually *is* is something subjective, and not a real thing which can be measured and observed. It discourages scepticism, and erodes trust in science.

This is prompted by me watching what I thought was a bad example of science communication, and the comments on that TikTok were absolutely flooded with misinformation and general bullshit about science.

Browsing this sub often makes me feel lucky, I got in and out of college in 4 years, landed a really good job in my field out of college, I'm making great money, eligible for promotions/job hopping, on paper I'm doing great for 25. 

However I am really not having a good time, I'm suffering from the side effects of letting an 18 year old choose what career they want to pursue for their adult life. I'm a merchant Mariner, I drive ships for a living. (It's like the first 15 minutes of the movie Captain Phillips with Tom Hanks). I work 80+ hours a week, 26 weeks of the year, which generally is ~35 back to back to back 12 hour days (I am lucky to have this short of a rotation and not 60-120 days); I am also away from home 6 months a year.  I honestly can't hang, and I feel like a pussy because of it, but I'm just seeing so many cautionary tales that are telling me I need to get out of here, or else I'll become like any one of these miserable people. This job is not conducive to being a good husband or father, I am neither of those things at the moment, but when the time comes, I'd like to be good at them. 

I'm currently working on an exit strategy, but I have so few transferable skills from my degree, my plan is to go back to school and get an associates in a medical trade. Depending on how you'd calculate my hourly rate it should turn out to be either a $3/hr pay cut, or a $20/hr  raise to start, so I'm not particularly worried about that. 

But the daunting part, because I don't have the prerequisites, this is going to take me 3 years to complete. I know I'll probably look back and laugh, but entering a job field at 28 feels like I'd be an old man starting new, however I feel like this a better option than trying to navigate this after getting married and being responsible for children.

While this study aims to enhance research and clinical considerations for LGBQ young adults and their families, it recognizes that stigmas faced by the trans\* community are unique and should not be coupled with stigmas faced by other minority groups. Therefore this study does not include trans\* individuals. This does not mean that trans\* and LGBQ individuals do not share common stigmas, but this study does not wish to generalize unique lived experiences that require more specialized research for this group.

To cope with the past, get through the present, and prepare for the future, make sure to exert a lot of your personal time to taking care of yourselves.

We can get caught in wanting to impress others by losing touch with who we really are.

While we navigate through these years, keep in mind that  the most important is our own health. Make sure to keep our chins up, even if we prefer to encourage others first. 

A personal lesson from the late teen years is that focusing on the need to be accepted by society, our peers, and ourself mounted needless stressors that likely seeped it's way into nasty habits just in order to chase that self-image.

So I worked at a fast food place for a year and a half but it was horrible. I moved into my BF's parents place during this time but work was pretty far from my (new) place, about 2 hours/2 buses (I wasn't living much closer beforehand and wasn't on the best terms with my parents who I was living with, but that's another topic). The store owner did not like me, they nitpicked my mistakes but ignored bigger issues, constantly changing my amount of hours, it was a disaster. But I got hired at Michael's (craft store/retail) and quit the fast food job as soon as I even interviewed with Michael's. I was just looking to have another job lined up before leaving fast food place so I wouldn't miss my bills.
Unfortunately, I just missed the cutoff for non-seasonal hires at Michael's, and with non-essential stores being closed and curbside pickup only, I was laid off a few weeks ago. I left on good terms and I'm a little disappointed but I'm not angry.

This is the first time I haven't had a job since shortly after I dropped out of university just weeks into my second year (first year barely passed and didn't really study). I was barely 19 then and living with my parents who paid my bills when I didn't have a job. Now I'm 21 and living with my bf and his parents, I pay my own phone bill and health insurance (my meds are much cheaper that way) and peggo (hoping to learn to drive soon, for now I'm bussing.

As for school, I took a pause from college summer 2020 as I wasn't doing well with the remote learning. I found a few textbook online that I'm writing notes with, studying accounting and payroll administration.

My question is, how do I get out of this hole of loneliness? I've been struggling to get even a minimum wage job before quarantine hit, and I had a government job (data entry) the summer I was in uni, but haven't had any luck getting back in with them or using that experience to get me out. I've been struggling with my ADHD and using reminders to run the household since I'm home the most, but I feel so useless rn and worried Ill run out of money for my bills before I get another job.

I'm sure things will be okay one day. I look on Pinterest and I know one day my bf and I will get our own place, I'll get a career and things like that, but I don't know how to get there. I feel like I've failed in life and that I can't get a good job that will last (fast food place was the only job I worked at for more than 6 months, other than Michael's tho everything was from when I was 16-18). And I've dropped out of school twice (graduated high school with honours tho, went to uni right after and burnt myself out). I can barely study for 20 minutes at a time and I just want to give up, but I also need to fight for that future and idk I just need help? Advice?

\- I ate like an absolute pig. Having an office job didn't help (I had fast food for lunch and always grabbed some fast food for dinner). The sedentary lifestyle caused me to put on weight

\- I started drinking alot... at times 4 days of the week. Then during the pandemic I started day drinking out of boredom. I remember one Saturday morning I woke up and the first thing I did was have some whiskey and coffee. 

\- Zero physical activity 

\- Stress from work and also family issues.

Long story short, I was feeling very off one evening and took my blood pressure. It was 181/113. I went to the ER. They took me right in because my symptoms resembled a stroke. Thank goodness it wasn't. I was ordered to monitor my blood pressure over the next week and it was consistently at around 150/95.

My doctor ordered an echocardiogram and it turns out I have thickening of my left ventricle and early hypertensive heart disease. I'm only 25. Apparently my incredibly unhealthy lifestyle for the passed 7 years has been beating up my heart!

The good news is that my doctors believe if I get my blood pressure under control with medication and start eating healthy/exercising and reducing stress where possible, my condition won't progress. In fact I was told I could potentially reverse it.

I’ve always been an extrovert and I could always make friends and talk with people so I never had trouble connecting with people.

Everyone around my age does the same thing, listens to the same genre of music, interested in doing the same activities over and over again,pretty much identical copies of one another zero originality. It doesn’t really make me want to put myself out there and be friends. Another big reason is I have a lot of siblings and a majority of my extended family lives with my city so it’s really heard to meet people who already don’t know someone within your family/extended family. 

I’ve been blessed with this extroverted personality so I might as well put it to use. Also I forgot to add that I don’t really use social media. I have a Snapchat( really close friends &amp;family), Twitter that I use to read funny stuff/news, and a tiktok that I just scroll through.

Hello! I'm not sure this is allowed here, but I'm going to try anyway.

I am an independent author and I recently published a novel titled *Escape* on Friday. The book is categorized as YA magical realism.

Here's the blurb:

**Laila is Richardsville High's quirky girl. She's just biding her time until graduation when she has an unusual encounter with Matty, the all-American boy next door, everybody just can't get enough of. When Matty and Laila start to talk, he shares a secret with her. He's a part of a clinical study for a medication called effugium and it can really transport him to other places and times. Will Laila trust Matty enough to try the effugium?**

I'm looking for readers to send a free digital copy of *Escape* to in exchange for an \*honest\* Goodreads, Instagram, or blog review.

I don't have the financial funds to pay for a big art shcool with an animation program but I have found a great design shcool abroad that offers master degrees in art direction , so I'm considering moving to europe to pursue that program ( while taking animation related online courses ) . The thing is I don't really know if that degree will help me get into animation or if it would give me an edge over the competition since it's way more "" graphic design "" focused . Another option would be to stay in my country and find a job that I could do while working on my portfolio on the side since degrees in that field aren't a huge requirements , this option is less expensive but definitely doesn't give me the ability to move abroad or get closer to my dream job .

I’m 21. So I first got into college, we have uni in Australia but the college was basically apart of the uni. So we still get to be on campus and all that. This was 2017. My parents (Indian/Hispanic) knew I was going there. Anyways about 8 months later I took a break to work a bit. So my parents knew I sorta took a break. I think the total they know is I took a nearly a year off break in total. I also did another short course at another uni (let’s call it UTT, it’s really good for my career path)  I was trying to transfer to. Anyways at the time i told my parents i made it into UTT for my MAIN course and was no longer in the college but in reality because of anxiety I ended up not finishing the MAIN college course. So other than that short ass useless course I did at UTT, I had wasted another 1 year and half just doing shit all. Which they don’t know about that year and half, for some reason I was more focused on making most of my social life and it was helping allot with my anxiety. 

So end of 2019 I started getting my shit together and finished my main course units and then transferred to the uni which was apart of the college. Because of covid no classes were running at the one my parents thought I transferred to which was UTT) So I told them I’m “coming” back to the college (however this time I was apart of the uni not the college section), anyways I actually made it into UTT during the last 6 months of 2020 for my main course cause of high grades and will be graduating mid next year. So yeah now I’m there for my main course 
So basically so sum it up they don’t know about the year and half I wasted. And also they don’t know about how I wasn’t in UTT before for my MAIN course but now I am. So yeah I just feel bad because I feel like I kinda got away with a huge lie. All my lies turned into truths but Since my anxiety medication had upped I’ve been feeling like shit for it suddenly. Everyone I know is telling me to chill and that I’ve gotten my shit together and even my therapist has told me it’s bette to just continue and not dwell because I fixed it up. I can’t tell either way cause there’s allot I wouldn’t tell. But idk why I’m just feeling shit , I have nothing else now that I’m hiding. It’s all just the past stuff all fixed up.

To me it's more about overcoming a threshold of your personal challenges. I say this because a person with depression can be courageous for waking up in the morning, just as a person is with serving in the military. it's a relative thing.

I appreciate that I am aging well but it is becoming extremely annoying to be mistaken for a teenager. My main issue is - how old am I expected to look at the young age of 28???? I think people should talk to a person first before judging his or her age since there is no set way to look at any age. People actually assume I am in my 30s once we actually have a full conversation but it does seem that people have such a hard time separating looks from reality. My oldest is 4 years old. Common sense should tell a person that I am probably not 17 or 18 years old running errands during school hours with a preschooler. You

My lawyer (formerly his lawyer) found some things in one of his old files. One was a letter addressed to his kids. It was a list of life tips. This is what she scanned it to me.

1.  Call your mom once a week; no more, no less.

2.  Do your laundry on quarter draft night (the laundry room will be empty). Fold your clothes before you put them away. Don't use liquid fabric softener on towels, they will shed water like a well oiled duck. Wash your sheets on Thursday (you never know).

3.  Keep your dorm room clean. Don't use Febreze.

4.  Don't drive if you can ride the bus; don't ride the bus if you can bike; don't bike if you can walk.

5.  Don't study in the library stacks; too many people will walk around and disturb you. Study in the Asian heritage section; no one ever goes in there.

6.  Take the time to find the hidden burrito place; it will save your life when you're really hungry and it's a good place to take someone on the first date.

7.  Get a work study job in the library if you can; food service work study will make you angry.

8.  Don't try to study outside.

9.  Don't defend your music/book/movie/political tastes by attacking another's.

10. Don't take up smoking as a habit, no matter what.

11. Write notes on anything and everything.

12. Don't buy one of those nifty ID cases with a keyring attached.

13. Don't fall for the easy student credit card applications.

14. Learn the name of the janitor who cleans your dorm and your class buildings.

15. Your first roommate is the first person you meet on campus. It's also the first person you will have disagreements with. Remember, he will be gone at the end of the year, but you'll remember him for the rest of your life.

16. Get stupid-loud-emotional-puking drunk once. Once is all it takes.

17. Learn to be homesick, but do it alone.

18. You will get horribly, terribly, awfully sick at some point during your first semester. Don't try to fight it or deny that it will happen to you. Go to the clinic, get some anti-biotics and let it happen. It will save you for the next 4 years.

19. Only order take-out once a month. Tip the delivery guy well (30-50%, he's most likely a student like you working his way through school).

20. Walk to bars; take a cab home.

21. Never drink alone in your room.

22. If you find yourself in a townie bar, have one beer, tip the bartender well and leave. If you go back, the bartender won't ask you for your drink order, he or she will just set it up on the bar for you without asking. It's an amazing thing to see when someone in service treats you with respect. Return it.

23. Find time to go to the gym.

24. Study two hours for every hour in class.

25. Eat in the dining hall. Avoid foods that don't involve silverware. Don't carb load at breakfast, eat a good-sized lunch, and don't overdo it at dinner. Sit down, eat slow. It should take about an hour PER MEAL.

26. There are 168 hours in every week. Subtract all of the class, study, gym, and eating time. You'll find that you won't be able to sleep 8 hours everyday. This is life, and it will prepare you for adulthood. Nothing interesting happens while you sleep, if it does, you shouldn't have been asleep in the first place.

27. Your professors (the ones with Dr. in front of their names or Ph. D. after) are your first employers. Learn what you need to learn but question them if it doesn't fit. In the end, they will be your job references after college.

28. Your graduate assistants and adjuncts are your peers. They have a lot of useful and pertinent information about how to get through these four years and in the end, the good ones will become your friends. Some of my good friends were once my GA's and adjuncts and we still chat frequently.

29. You will have veterans in your classes. Some folks around you will dismiss their training and experience. They have real world knowledge and have earned your respect.

30. Drink cheap beer when offered (Bud Light, Miller Lite, Coors Light). Drink good beer at the bar (Sam Adams, Dos Equis, Heineken). Keep better beer in your fridge (Murphy's, Bass, Flat Tire).

31. Wean yourself off caffeine during finals week. This may sound counter-intuitive, but trust me on this one.

32. You are not entitled to your opinion, you're only entitled to what you can defend.

33. You don't deserve a good grade for showing up. You didn't pay for ""A""s, you paid for the seat. Effort pays off, attendance is part of that. It's your money, make sure its well spent.

34. Find your professors' offices and learn their hours; you'll need them.

35. Accept that you will make mistakes and ask for help. It's easier to recover this way than trying to handle it on your own.

36. Be firm in your convictions; if you don't believe in something, chances are, you'll believe anything.

37. There is always a quiet place in the student center. You can usually nap there during the day.

38. When you're walking, keep your feet, but keep your head up. You'll be amazed at how many people will greet you when they can see your face.

39. Don't judge anyone by the anything other than their actions. You don't know their story, just as they don't know yours.

40. Don't text someone in the same room as you. If it can't be said aloud, it can wait until you're in private.

41. Don't email someone in the same building. Get up, walk to where ever he or she is and tell them face to face.

42. Not everything needs to be said. You'll learn what these things are as you go along.

43. Don't refuse an invitation to meet someone's parents. Shake their hands and refer to them as Sir and/or Ma'am until/unless they tell you otherwise. NOT BEFORE.

44. Your first summer job will set you up for success for the rest of your college career.

46. Go to the free concerts on campus.

47. Become a football fan.

48. The other people around you are in the same situation as you are. They are all scared, excited, tired, and apprehensive. You are learning how to adult; its a process; drive it when you can, but more importantly let it happen. The only thing you control are your own actions.

49. Listen to music at a moderate volume in your dorm room with the door open and without headphones. Good conversation starter.

50. Volunteer.

51. Understand what social location is, then pay no attention to it.

52. Buy a tailored suit.

53. It will probably be required, but even if it isn't, take a sports class.

54. Don't eat from the vending machines. Buy a package of your favorite snack and hide it.

55. Hide money in the pockets of your clean clothes.

56. When people hang out in your room, don't let them sit on your bed. During this time in your life when personal space is virtually non-existent, your bed is the closest thing to a sanctuary that you will have.

57. Make sure people take their garbage with them when they leave. This includes emotional garbage.

58. The required classes fill up early. Learn what a ""force add"" is and use it.

59. Wear shower shoes in the shower.

60. Wear house shoes unless you're leaving the building.

61. Own a crazy set of pajamas. Wear them to your earliest final every semester.

62. Send your mother a birthday card every year.

63. Don't let your personal life become a hassle for your roommates or your RA. They are students too.

64. Don't try to drill a hole in the keg to get to the beer inside. A repair bill for the consequences is not a joke. Trust me on this one.

65. Sit in the front of the class.

66. Wear a hat and a heavy coat when the weather gets cold; a hoodie won't cut it.

67. Wear shorts whenever possible.

68. Flip flops are perfectly acceptable. Crocs are never acceptable.

69. Get up early on the weekends. Your Monday self will thank you.

70. Learn how to fix your own appliances. YouTube and a good parts website will keep you from accumulating a storage bin full of easily repaired coffee makers.

71. Dress for dinner on Friday nights and encourage your friends to do the same. Jacket and tie for the men and a skirt/dress just above the knee for the ladies. Even if you’re eating in the dining halls, this will attract the right people to your sphere.",youngadults,From my dad,0.0

I just feel a little snuffed out sometimes. I feel like when I have something, she takes it away. But I also may be reading too much into it, or projecting my own insecurities and I would appreciate some people who aren't emotionally involved weighing in.

I have never really had a bedroom. My mom uses them to store things, and comes and goes as she pleases with absolutely no knocking. When I was around 12, I started sleeping in the nude. She still came and went as she pleased. I tried to say that it bothered me and she said that we didn't have enough space. We did live with roommates at the time. But before that, we lived with my stepdad. And my room was a section of the living room sectioned off with bamboo curtains. I had to hide in a corner to get dressed because otherwise anyone could see me. I couldn't do it in the bathroom because one was in my mom and stepdad's bedroom, and the other was in my step brother's bedroom. I wasn't allowed to spend long in either.

There was a parrot at my mom's work that I loved.  I held him all the time and he was kind of a friend to me. Then I started school up again in the fall and only saw him on weekends. He started flying off of me and to my mom every time I went to hold him. That hurt, but birds are weird, as I've been told. It felt like I lost a friend, but my mom loved him a lot then and he was really special to her. 

My mom worked at this beautiful place for a few years while I was a kid and took me with her. I loved it there, and always wanted to go back someday. When I was ready to get a job and start my adult life, I found out they were hiring there. This was 10 years after my mom had quit and moved on to another career. But she applied too. We both got jobs there, in the same department. Then, our boss quit. It was my dream job. But my mom is older and has more experience, so she got promoted. That hurt too. But it's her dream too. And she says I am young still with lots of time to get to live my dream.

I'm 17, I'll turn 18 next june. I just got out of high school and will soon (March-April) be studying to be a translator. A woman who hired my dad to get some stuff done at her house casually told him about an American busses company from which she is one of the supervisors. I live in Argentina but I love English and have been studying it for 12 years approximately. That's why she thought it might be a good idea for me to join her as an agent. Now, I had never had a job, and as school wasn't rigorous at all my life for the past two years was just watching youtube videos, playing videogames and doing my homework in the last minute. I knew it would be tough for me to get out of that but it was a great opportunity for me to practice my English and acquire some responsibility before 2020.

Suddenly a new year has arrived and I'm working from home taking calls from passengers hundreds of kilometres away from me. The thing is, though, that I have always been a introvert and really shy, so this is really out of my comfort zone. The job isn't the worst, I just have to try and sell some tickets, help customers with their doubts and take their claims. However, before I start my 5/6 hour shift I just get really anxious, thinking I'm just not able to do it and fearing those people who may call me. I know I cannot see them, I know it's not my fault when a bus breaks or any other situation occurs, but I keep on overthinking.

Honestly I'm not sure I need advice. It's like those times when I was a child afraid of the dark. I would get nervous looking at the foot of the bed and after nightmares. I knew I couldn't help the situation, but I also knew that one day I would grow out of that fear. Well, I'm just waiting to outgrow this new fear. But in the meanwhile, I thought it could be good for me to hear some of your stories. How were your first-job experiences?

The programs I applied to (MPH) were very competitive and there was nothing wrong with my applications, I just wasn't selected as a top candidate.

She wants me to contact the admissions committee, write a letter to the dean, and keep submitting applications until I get in. That is ridiculous and selfish and I won't do it, and of course she sees that as me ""giving up.""

Now she's trying to encourage me to go abroad to work with a global health agency, which sounds really cool but I'm not qualified for it at all. They don't let just anyone go on these trips; they want highly educated people with many years of experience in the field, not 23-year-olds looking for work experience. Just because the job is in another country doesn't mean the standards are lower. But again, she's convinced that if I just apply for it I can somehow talk them into hiring me.

I notice many guys who always stressed out about age. They either think they are too young or too old to live their dreams. I say most of you guys need to permit yourself to start living your life. No one is going to come to you and allow you. You need to empower yourself, wake up, and realize that its time to take life by the horns. Otherwise, the years will go by, and you will not have to accomplish anything that you want.

Many people get stuck in their 9 to 5 or eventually marry someone they don't like. Instead of becoming less lonely, they become ever more alone, and they let themselves go. You need to be the opposite of them. You need to find your identity, your values, and take action. Every successful person I met told me that the main thing that made a difference was they took action.

I’m beginning to feel that something is seriously wrong with me. I constantly feel low, down, and I rarely get any pleasure or happiness out of anything anymore.

I was invited paintballing today by a family member and his work mates, I spent about half the day out there, was completely exhausted, and then sat in the waiting area watching Netflix. I felt really shitty because a) id spent like £50, and b) I rarely knew anyone and felt like I was just making everyone awkward and on edge.

I always feel tense and stressed, even if I’m just sat on the sofa, at work, out going grocery shopping or even playing video games or anything that used to make me happy. Sometimes I’ll just scream, not for anything, but just to release. Sometimes I’ll burst into tears, for no apparent reason.

I don’t have any friends (except a few friendly people at work but I wouldn’t consider them close friends) and most of my family live ~100 miles away, except my immediate family who live with me.

I work a 35 hour work week (which usually turns into getting so stressed out that it turns into sometimes 45 because I need to catch up), I spend a day a week on mandatory work training (for a bachelor’s degree) which also means I spend around another 20 hours a week on study or assignments. 

I’ve tried speaking to my GP - who basically referred me for “CBT” (cognitive behavioural therapy), which for me is a complete waste of time and did nothing for me. When I’ve pushed him further, I feel like he doesn’t really understand me. Truth be told, I don’t really understand me.

Where am I going wrong? What can I improve on? Because truth be told, I really don’t know what else to do anymore. I’ve considered doing something more drastic to try eliminate the pain but I can’t even bring myself to do that. I just feel so useless, helpless, and I don’t know how to go on.

No matter how busy successful people are, they always spend at least an hour a day — or five hours a work week — learning or practicing. And they do this across their entire career.

The 5 Hour Rule has been traced all the way back to Benjamin Franklin, who was constantly setting aside time to learn each day. It’s also been embraced by several leaders like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Oprah.

The rule has been broken down into 3 buckets that learning takes place through:

* Reading: Investing in a reading habit can, expectedly, help you grow each and every day
* Reflection: Taking the time to assess what you’ve learnt and how you can get better will set you up for success in the future
* Experimentation: Experiments show you what’s working and where you need to improve.

I was added as a mod here quite some time ago with plans to make this into almost a continuation of /r/teenagers and had hopes to see it thrive. But uh, kinda forgot about all of that, life got in the way, I got busy, a new job, etc. But now that my time is almost here to say goodbye to /r/teenagers (been a long time coming tbh), I’ve begun a hunt to find another subreddit with a community as tight as it is over there. After coming up empty, I’ve returned here and decided I might as well throw my hat into the dozens of failed /r/teenagers spinoff subreddits and see how it goes. 

I’ve written some basic rules that will be expanded upon eventually as (if) the subreddit grows and have a basic naut theme up so it’s not completely boring to look at. If someone has any artistic skills and wants to throw up any ideas for a more eye catching banner then please, be my guest. 

Once you hit like 19 on /r/teenagers you really start to feel like you don’t belong and hitting 20 makes it even worse. Not only is it harder to relate to posts and trends, but there really is a feeling of *you shouldn’t be here* let alone mod the place. /r/YoungAdults is aimed at people ages 18 to throughout their 20’s, so hopefully conversation and topics will be a bit more mature while still throwing memes around and having a stupid good time as well. Similar to /r/teenagers, we don’t age discriminate and welcome any ages on here. The more participation the better :) 

Anyways, I hope at least some of the people reading this will find some sort of enjoyment from this subreddit. There’s not much that isn’t allowed. Advice threads, relevant memes, discussions of any kinds, etc. Just have fun!

This study can be completed in person or via skype. Those interested in participating can complete the [screener](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d54FFAjmm9VxEKp) (should take about 5 minutes). Please email me if you have any questions!

Thank you in advance!

My name is William and I am a graduate student at Tiffin University. I am conducting a research project for my class which is looking to identify risk factors present in young adults which predispose them to suicide. Suicide is a problem I am hoping to shed further light on as well as find effective ways to combat/treat. As I am sure you are aware of, the suicide rate in this demographic is steadily rising, so there is a strong need for studies on this topic. The link for the survey will be provided below. All responses collected in this research will be analyzed in aggregate form, and no names will be linked to the analysis. 

 

If you are participating in this survey you have to be in the age range of 18-25 and have/had suicidal ideation/thoughts/behavior. Participating in the survey will make you eligible to enter a giveaway to win a $25 Amazon gift card.

I will litteraly do anything to destract me from feeling bad about not doing it instead of just doing it. Maybe my life just changed too much in too short of a timeframe. I could have gone to an college closser to home so i could still live at home but i didnt want to. fun thing is that i was kicked out of the house a couple months back fro the 4th time, but this time permanently. I admit the first 3 times it was around 50 50 my fault and my stephfathers fault, but this time it was entirely his fault. he was the most dominant reason i wanted to move out so badly, but now that i actually moved out it isnt as nice i thought i would be. I miss my friends and my old environment. I come home on the weekends and sleep at my grandparents but it seems like my friends dont even miss me. Where i moved to i struggle making friends. My classmates are nice but anoying as fuck. cinsidering i have a hard time meeting people that isnt a big surprice though. Am i getting depressed? I just dont want my parents to be disapointed. And i dont want to waste my fathers money (that i used for paying college). My father died when i was 13 and i inheritted everything. My father would have known what i had to do. he was my only friend until when he died, then i was friendless for around 2 years before i found my current friends. I cant open up to my mother or anyone else, thats probably why i am wasting your time. and why tf do i want ia girlfriend so much? i cant even imagine being in a relationship. probably just hormones but damn i feel so lonely.

Like I am really relieved, that I asked. Because I was overthinking it way too much. And it wasnt as bad as I imagined. I probably should do it a few more times (with other girls), because I know I didnt ask her in the most confident way out. Wasnt keeping my eye-contact up and so on. Just smaller things.

By the way, I always try to go to the Discussions for the first few weeks to test the waters and see if they have any valuable information in there, but I could tell there wasn't much. 

During the first Discussion, I happened to notice a cute girl in the discussion and thought that maybe I could talk to her or something. Now, I'm a shy person, and so far the most amount of words we've exchanged is ""Bye."" ""Bye."" as I was walking out.

Well, now I really don't want to go because I found out it was useless and also I suck at talking to people (namely her), so this was going to be my last week going. That's when I saw this group of guys talking. Somehow, I initiated a conversation, and 10 minutes later, we are laughing and talking about shitty professors in our major.

So now I've decided to go to Discussions for the friends instead of the girl. I probably won't ask her out, let alone muster up 5 sentences.

Since my school just got a new gym built and a strength coach for athletics, our coach started having us do 2 lifts a week that are mandatory. I already lift 5 days a week, and knowing I put in more work lifting wise than anyone else on the team, my coach still yelled at me at practice about not showing up to the lifting groups and told me she considered cutting me as she thinks I take lifting more seriously than swimming. I’ll admit I was wrong with not showing up, but I told my captains that held it in advance and they were ok with it until presumably coach talked to them about it. I am one of the better swimmers on the team, but am not a great swimmer at practice (to be quite honest), and I think she’s using the lifting bit as an excuse to chew me out for other issues. She even said she didn’t think I was committed to the team, and that hurt me a lot as I pride myself in helping this team succeed to the best of my ability and am always encouraging others (even though sometimes I do that to motivate myself as well).

I am 19. Some people say I look younger, some say older, he likely doesn't know my age and seems to be very attracted to me, I think he's thinking that I am older, as there are literally no people in my age group in that church but 23+ people. My mum is obviously okay with a potential relationship since he has a good paying job, and is a clever guy. I am studying aerospace engineering, and from my mum's stalk into his social media, he is a computer engineer. Great, but I don't feel attraction towards him, considering the fact that he is 11-12 years older than me and such age gap could be a problem for us as a couple for sure. My mum is 57 and since this man is also like a baby to her, she doesn't mind our age gap. She also doesn't trust men (because of previous toxic relationships) and believes that the men only want women for sex or at least a reason, before they marry her or even fall in love with her. Because of this, I lost my belief for a potential partner and I don't really trust guys. Even though, I feel attraction towards guys in my age group even if they are not ready to be in a relationship (so am I) and don't want an older guy for now. But my mum wants me to have a comitted husband and a stable marriage, she says the man should be ready for marriage. Since all men want a woman in her 20s, after 15 years, my peers won't like me and dump me for girls in their 20s, my mum says.

This helps me creatively (I write poetry &amp; have recently begun experimenting with songs) but at the same time, I can't help but feel massively behind where other creatives and artists were at my age. 

Due to homeschooling, I spent a really long time with my head in the sand. Most of my peers grew up naturally building ties with our city's culture and were raised listening to a wide variety of music (e.g., the old school jams your parents love and always play, or the rock band phase that apparently everyone had in middle school) but when I look back I have... nothing. Same with film, tv shows... there's so much that I just don't know, and I'll never get those years back to learn. I've always wanted to be able to create expressive art that resonates with people, but I feel like I'm at such a loss having ""wasted"" so many of the years that my favorite artists had spent already working on and making waves with their craft.

It's weird - in no other aspect would I want to turn back the clock and be 13-19 again. But I do wish I'd had a deeper exposure to this massive world of music (other art forms too, but music is the most glaring). I envy and admire the kinds of people who could tell you about a decade of art forwards and backwards, and I feel bad that I probably won't ever be that person.",youngadults,feel like I was recently reborn (in a way) &amp; overwhelmed with how much there is to know in terms of music,0.0

I am a P.h.D student currently enrolled at the Department of Psychology, University of Bicocca-Milano. Currently, I am testing a novel approach to manipulating the ways we think about future events. Because I am currently in the testing phase, I need participants who will help me to determine whether the manipulation is effective. If the manipulation turns out to be effective it will be used in a future study that will (hopefully) be published in a relevant scientific journal.

She hadn’t been like that at all when I was an actual child, and it’s only gotten worse. 

Usually, I go on a walk every day unless it’s raining and today was no exception. During my walk, my phone died and the tracking app she uses to watch my location cut out. I walked home and she wasn’t there. Once my phone was charged, I called her and got screamed at for a good half an hour. She has decided that I’m not mature enough or worthy of being called an adult anymore after *that little stunt*.

Now, I’m not allowed to leave the house without her by my side until I move into my dorm in September. Then, if I want to even think about living in the dorms, I must get life360, call her to check in every few hours, and come home each weekend.

Concepts often seem to go over my head and I rarely ever recall what I thought I learnt. Over time, I realized that it was because I never truly understood what I was learning.

The Feynman technique is particularly effective at helping you master difficult concepts. Named after the Nobel Prize winning Richard Feynman, the concept focuses on explaining a difficult concept in easy to understand language as if you were explaining it to someone else (or a child). By following the Feynman technique, you might just end up learning difficult concepts quickly, spend less time studying, and remember concepts longer.

The four steps are as follows:

1. Write the concept down
2. Explain it using simple language
3. Address (look up) problematic areas or questions that remain
4. Challenge yourself to simplify it further

I have found this to be a powerful concept that helps you cut study time shortly. The push to understand and explain a concept forces you to identify areas where you have a gap in your understanding. I’ve broken this down even further here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RleSyp16lLE).

I needed help and friends in my younger years and didn't get them in time, and honestly over time I just didn't meet my milestones. I know it's not exactly all my fault, but at a certain point it certainly became my fault. I'm mentally deficient and unable to operate as anything behind 15-16 and I'm going to be committing suicide because of my failure to grow up.

It isn't an education or academic failure but my emotional maturity is stunted at such an early age and a broken home is responsible in part. I'm just a broken person. I made excuses to commit crimes and steal property from 17-19, and was arrested. I lost my scholarships, I lost my college admissions, I lost every ounce of independence from my second amendment rights to the ability to even walk outside. 

I guess I'm writing this because I wanna find some level of common ground with what should be ""kids"" my age, but even that's hard because I know I'm not mentally an adult. I'm not even close. I even said I want to communicate with other kids, what kind of literal adult thinks like that? And it hurts knowing I'm just not mentally there. Because I was bright, and I had a bright future ahead of me. I really did. I had compassion for others, but hatred for myself. I wanted to help people, but never received the help I desperately needed. I wanted help but instead I acted out and took drugs. I drank alcohol at 19 and I stole. 

I could've been an actual person but I'm nothing now. I'm gonna ask for early termination of house arrest for the gun theft conviction I got when I chose to be a druggie retard with no friends and pray it begins my probation early. If it does then I'm planning on just heading on over to some woods and shooting myself with a blackpowder antique revolver. Felons can have these in Florida, thankfully.

 I'm honestly really relieved, because I genuinely thought I was gonna be a mentally deficient pretend adult forever who is really just a physical embodiment of mental illness. I'm a product of homegrown abuse that didn't receive help due to an enabling and bipolar mom, a psychotic dad and a fucked up asshole of an older brother. I then spilled out into the community just to be thrown away forever. And now I'm gonna throw my life away again, but this time I'm ending it with suicide. I won't be doing it yet, I gotta wait a little to ask to get off early. But if the judge allows it, I'll update you. If he denies it, then I'll sneak out anyway and do it.

I'm 21/f. I'm on the AS spectrum, have pure O OCD, and have experienced emotional and physical abuse throughout my childhood, as well as peer rejection, so these feelings might be exacerbated in my case.

I feel incredibly restless and dissatisfied. Not physically. But emotionally, I feel like there's something out there I should be doing. I'm young, I'm in my prime. I won't be this way forever. I've read about various generations in the past-- the Greatest Generation, the Silent Generation, and how they all had their times come and go as young adults. I feel like right now, sitting in my parents' house during COVID quarantine, I'm wasting my life. 

You know how we were raised on YA novels, where people in their late teens had already saved the world and fought dragons and stuff? Obviously I never expected that to happen, but the whole idea that in my youth, I'd have some self-actualizing experience or adventure of some sort kind of hung around in my mind nonetheless. I feel like being 21 has been anti-climactic and I need to do something before I get old and gray...

Does anyone have any similar experiences or advice for how to deal with this feeling? I guess I'm saying I want to feel young.

A Little back story:

Back in May-June of this year, while I(22M) was back home because college closed and the whole country was in a lockdown, I matched with this guy(23M) on Tinder. I honestly didn't expect to find someone decent enough atleast in my area.

I'll be honest and say that I was talking to a few people at this time! But he was different. He gave off a nice vibe thorough text at least. We kept talking everyday till about August, when we made plans to meet. Around this time, I stopped talking to other guys and it was just him. He said he did the same too.

We had a great date. We enjoyed each other's company and there was no awkwardness whatsoever. So after that, we've been going on dates very week. I did mention early that I value my personal space and I'm not a fan of clingy people, to which he said that it was the same with him. So despite us talking everyday, we still give each other some space.

So anyway, along the course of us spending time together, I noticed myself getting attached and catching feelings for him. Now I've been the type to guard my heart and I don't let people in easily. But with each day, this man find a way inside and I can't help it. He makes me happy, he's funny and his optimism makes me wanna do better in life. He carries himself really well.  Overall he's what I pictured a Significant Other to be like.

Now I'm sacred of falling in love to be very honest! But I do tell himself I should jump the bullet because I know he likes me too.

So by mid September, I decided that I'll have a talk with him to see where our relationship is going. So far, we've been casually dating each other but I want it to be more than that. He's also told me that in his past relationships, he's never been the one to initiate a conversation about this because he's scared of rejection. But who isn't right? 

Now the biggest ""roadblock"" I'd say in all of this is that I'm leaving for college again in November. I ask myself if a long distance relationship is possible? What if he doesn't want one? From my side, as much as I don't want it to be LDR, I'd try to make it work. But I don't know what he thinks.

I've not gotten a chance to meet him in about 4 weeks. He been swarmed with work and there was this one week when he was free, but I was visiting my Grandparents so we couldn't meet.

Now I don't want to have this ""talk"" with him over the phone or through text. I NEED TO SEE HIM IRL.

As bad as it sounds, some nights I stay up late just thinking about 'Us and if we'd have something together"". At times it makes me happy thinking of the good things. But I'm also an overthinker and I would get myself sad thinking of the not-so-good things that could happen. And it kills me sometimes. 

We've been talking this week and I had my hopes up thinking I could meet him because He said that work has been chill. I made him a whole virtual card to ask him out for a date. Right as i was about to send it to him, he sent me a message of him quirkily asking his friends to hang out with him today. I played it off as it being funny but at that moment my heart sunk!

I was upset, not because he will go out with his friends but because I'll be home for only two weeks or so and then I'm leaving. I just want to spend time with him and it's not he doesn't know that I'll be going. And he's always the one that was adamant about priorities and it's kind of sad in a way.

I watch movies and hear stories about people having this fairytale love life and I ask myself why can't I get one? The rational side of me knows that relationships are not all smiles and giggles and I'm prepared for that but I feel like I deserve  a shot at a ""Fairytale"" too?!",youngadults,Is falling in love supposed to be like this?,0.0

The shit really started hitting the fan last Wednesday: six hours of online classes, four hours of work on the farm, responded to 5 calls during a storm. Only two of which I got on the truck for and one resulted in me crawling under live wires and walking a mile with about 30lbs of gear just to reach the patient. 

Thursday: six hours of online classes, another call where I got left behind (I live far from my station), and I wrote an essay. 

Friday: another day of online classes, finished my essay and other homework. Then three hours of work at another job where I got bitched at for not working hard enough despite the fact that the person yelling at me was barely working herself, then another call when I got out. 

Saturday: worked in the morning, call in the afternoon, finally had time to relax. 

Sunday: spent morning at the station doing online trainings, worked a couple hours at my third part time job, then got on the tanker and did water supply for a “structure fire” that really wasn’t and got credit for a couple more calls while I was there. Played a board game with my friend. 

Monday: demolished my deck, was in the officers seat first engine into a car accident, Canadian thanksgiving with my bitch of a mom, and weekly training. 

Tuesday: school and a bit of relaxation, also my dad blaming me for mud he tracked in from the demolished deck. 

Today: SATs, and I missed work because my boss texted me around 8 but I left at 7 and wasn’t allowed to have my phone. 

For the week that’s 5 days of school, 17 hours of work,  one standardized test, 8 hours of training, and 12 calls, with 4 of those resulting in engine (or tanker) rides. 

Now I’ve got work tomorrow, a burn on Saturday, probably work Saturday afternoon, work and probably more work on Sunday, on top of school and any homework that I get. I’m starting to see why people don’t like adulting.

I'm a 20 yo female, just a little background for y'all. I fell in love with someone who's at the same age as me 2 years ago after he courted me for about 2 months. However, I rejected him for reasons that I don't wanna discuss on here. So as you can see, it's kinda contradictory, because I rejected someone I fell in love with. So that's the place I was in, my heart belongs to him while my mind made the decision of 'no, you can't be with him and you know it very well'. 

The rejection ended quite tragically because it was in valentine's Day and both of us ended up crying in our own room, and at the end, we decided to remain as friends because it was too hard for us to not see each other anymore. 

Time flew, and we would meet up once or twice every semester, to catch up with each other and stuff. The whole time I was struggling to get over him because of all the meet ups would rekindle my feelings for him but every time he would always put out the feelings rekindled in my heart, through his actions and stuff, which was devastating to me. It's like every time I have second thoughts he would destroyed it. I know I should've talk about it with him, but the thing is he knew, and I'm not trying to paint a bad image of him here, but he said that he would never changed for anyone. But honestly, I don't believe that, I know that someday he would change for someone, it's just that it's not me. All I wish was that he would at least say that he would try, which was good enough for me already, but he was adamant, so I guess that's fine. 

I felt terribly guilty for him because technically I did lead him on into thinking that we were possible, and things he said to me about how much damage he had to dealt with (of course he didn't say all that just to get my pity,  I could tell how much it hurts for him too). So it's so hard for me to move on, knowing that he's still hurt (in my point of view), and I didn't know if he had gotten over me. 

This guilt eats me up until recently, I was told by a mutual friend of us that he had already moved on and he had a crush on some girl. I was so glad. It's like all the burden that I was carrying, worrying about him was gone (I know I didn't have to carry them in the first place). But I was so happy, it gave me peace, true inner peace knowing that I can stop worrying (I know I didn't have to in the first place) and I'm just, relieved, truly free from this. 

Idk what to say at this point, but I'm just happy, and idk I wanna share this at here. I hope it's fitting because I've seen a lot of posts about young adults struggling in the society and I'm just lucky that I haven't had to deal with it. Thanks for reading.",youngadults,Moving on,0.0

It is the main thing that bothers me about elections.  Straight ticket voting is the equivalent of saying because you bought a PS2 because you thought it was the better console  you can’t buy the Xbox Series X even though it’s now the better console (this isn’t true but it’s an example guys).  It presents an annoying problem where you have to choose which election matters the most to you and that’s the party ticket you go for despite having to vote for every other dem/republican on the list despite how you feel about them.  As an independent this bothers me to an extreme amount but it isn’t an moderate exclusive problem.  As there are Democrats and Republicans who would rather vote for the opposite on the ticket on some elections. The current political standard feels like a way to suppress votes for the other party in forcing you to choose.,youngadults,Split-ticket voting during elections need to become standard across all states,0.0

I was always shy and always found it hard to make friends in middle school i had one but never felt close to her. Through the years i always felt lonely and no matter how much i tried i just couldn't make myself social and less shy.

On the first day of high-school an accident happened while i was getting picked for which class i needed to be in (it's a little complicated to explain in short), and suddenly i was alone again every student found their place already getting to know others but me, i was just setting there waiting for someone to tell me what to do or go.

When school day ended i left to go home and i just decided i didn't want to go to school anymore.
After weeks of me fighting with my parents and lying about the real reason of why i dropped out (i told them I'm just done with school) they let me be. For months i stayed hidden in my room to avoid others questioning me about my decision and i just kept lying about the real reason.

I turned 18 and i started looking for a job but no one accepted me, one of the reason is i needed to know a second language but i wasn't good at it and to this day i only managed got one job. I did learn a few courses like makeup and stuff but i wasn't happy cause i always wanted to be something else.

At the beginning of the year pandemic happened and i had to leave my job, and everyday that passed i kept thinking about what would happen if i didn't drop out, i see my old classmates doing productive things and living their lives and here is me just sitting home waiting for my life to build itself.

Then i decided to take a course to continue high-school, i started it last month but now i had to stop because of the pandemic i can't go out anymore.

To fully get my high-school degree i need another 2 years which I'll be 24-25y. I feel like i wasted those years over nothing, like i have a lot of dreams, i want to become an architecture i want to study in norway i want to be happy for once.
These are all my dream and i feel like if i didn't have such a personality i could've done this already, i could be were i want to be.

But i wasted them over nothing and i don't know if i really will really keep going for the next 2 years. I feel like I'll be too old for college or another bad thing will happen with me and make me more helpless and i just don't know what to do and how to stay motivated.",youngadults,I regret dropping out of high-school,0.0

I took these “photos” when I was 14 and sent them to my ex when me and her were still together. It was a long distance relationship, so we despised that we should keep in touch with photos through Snapchat, some of the photos were “photos”. I never sent them without making sure it was okay with her, which it pretty much always was because we were raging in hormones. The thing with her though was that she only liked me for my “lower area”, and I wasn’t even her type, as she liked more chubbier boys with curly hair, and I didn’t have those features. After awhile, I got sick of her and started to see how she wasn’t who I thought she was, as she was going around with other people, she was always guilt tripping me and making stuff to make it seem bad on me. Of course I wasn’t the best as this was the first “long term”-ish relationship that I was in, I made suicide threats, i got mad at her for stupid stuff, but it got worse after me and her broke up and tried to remain friends. I would still miss her but for her body, because she was well developed for her age (15 at the time), and soon after I got out of that horny stage from talking to her, I would talk her down and and call her a “cum dump” and take my anger out on her. She got fed up with it one day and screenshotted a “photo” of me that didn’t have my face in it, and threatened to post it. Of course, she didn’t do it but then much more recently, by the very end of June to very first 3 days of July, she made another threat to send a video of me eating my cum to everyone I knew, which included my littler sister. I was just done when I read it and I just went to sleep and cried. After I woke up, I checked her messages and read that I needed to block a number so that she wouldn’t send the video. I complied and she said “I didn’t ruin your life, so don’t ruin mine”, I told her “I have no intention of ruining your life”, and I really did mean it. What I’m confused of as to why that number knows MY number, and how she even got a hold of that video of me. Because yes I did send a video like that to her, but I was worrying because I don’t remember if it had both my “area” and my face in it in the same frame. And then, that video should have been deleted unless it was saved, because it was over snapchat. Recently, as of this October, I tried to talk her out of it and get her to delete said videos from her phone. But before we get to that, I question wether she truly did have that video of me or not, because it was sent long ago, and two, she said that she’d send it to everyone I know and does know anyone but me, my sister and another girlfriend I had at the time, who I’m not with anymore. And I feel like even if she DID have the video or whatever herself she “has” of me, she wouldn’t send it because that would be distribution of child pornography, and she cares too much about her own life to mess up her job opportunities and what not. Something in me is telling me that she’s bluffing just so I don’t unblock that number. She would be too scared to ruin her own life, if not mine, and she wouldn’t live with the shame of knowing she ruined someone else’s life. And even if she DID send out those videos, she would be on the worse end, because I know karma wouldn’t hold back on her if she did it. And karma might already be getting her right now. I don’t wish anything bad on her, but she’s just so malicious, I don’t know how she can be okay with threatening to do that to me and send those videos to not only everyone I know, but my LITTLE SISTER. Back to October, I tried to convince her to delete the videos of me, and I told her that I want to cooperate with her and not “tell her what to do”, as she said herself. I was more worried about her than I was about myself, because I knew no matter what happened, I know I would be okay, everything would be okay for me in the end. It was going well at first but then I started overthinking and started to try and get some real answers, as all she said was “you don’t need to worry, as long as you don’t unblock that number, I won’t send the videos”. I tried to ask her “how did that number know of me?”, “how are you and I supposed to move on, as you said, when your holding stuff about me from the past to cause me worry and distress, and have me worried about my future”. She started to get mad and said “okay you fucked up n***a, I’m sending all the videos”. I told her “please don’t, your gonna regret it, don’t do it”. She said “stop talking to me”. I asked her if she was going to tell me if she was going to do it or not, but she just said “stop talking to me”. She never gave me a “yes” or “no”. So now I’m in worry right now and I’ve been in worry. I know I’ll be okay and she won’t do it, but it’s just the threats she made and how malicious and evil she was that hurt me. I constantly feel a little empty inside because it’s been on my mind so much as of recent. The only thing that’s been keeping me going is my faith in my self from spiritual practices, and my close friends who I’ve made as of recent. But I’m scared that my ex would ruin my relationships. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been contemplating suicide so much recently and I’m worried and anxious. I really do think I’ll be okay, and maybe I’m just being tested by the universe right now, but I’m also thinking of bringing the law into this situation, as I have proof of her making threats to me and confirming that she was my videos, atleast by her word.

COVID isn’t terrible here but we have a few locally transmitted cases popping up everyday. Most people are pretty much going about life as usual and there are very few people wearing face masks in public now. 

I live with my parents and they are still taking very extreme precautions. I haven’t been allowed to go anywhere that’s not my causal job (once a week), order takeout or even eat anything that hasn’t been cooked over heat (never thought I would crave a salad but here we are). This has been going on since early March. Any time I bring up something as simple as ordering pizza they’ll say something like “oh so you basically want our entire family to die from coronavirus because you were craving pizza”. I know that they’re taking it too far but they’re set in their ways so I really don’t have the mental capacity to fight them because I know it will end badly. I also don’t have a drivers license or really any means to be financially independent from them at the moment so my movements are very limited. 

A close friend of mine I’ve known from 7th grade up til now (we’re 20-21) is of the opinion that the virus isn’t a big deal and even if we get it we won’t die so she’s always trying to get me to go out with her and I keep refusing because there’s really no way for me to right now. She thinks that I haven’t confronted them forcefully enough. I’ve tried explaining to her my family dynamic but she just doesn’t get it and gets very frustrated. She’ll bring up the fact that her mum has asthma and still goes out to restaurants and is doing fine so there’s no excuse for me.

So this afternoon I was on Facebook and came across a conversation post regarding an OIS(Officer-involved shooting) and I commented on it. 

Now I am pretty mature for my ripe ole age of 19, I’m a Firefighter, own a new car, probably going to buy a house soon, A-/+ all throughout my school career and am very aware of the world. I am very knowledgeable on politics(I’d have teachers spinning by the end whenever we had debates haha) I also follow the stock market and current events with intense interest.

Anyway so I made my comment, now this incident occurred some time ago and is pretty clean-cut and dry. The suspect had a gun and shot at a police officer, and unfortunately was killed in the incident. Someone stated that since this person was only 21 they couldn’t possibly be smart enough and have enough life experience to know what he was doing and shouldn’t be blamed for his actions etc. I commented back stating that as a 19yr old I’m very much aware that you don’t steal a car and then shoot at the police and that anyone with common sense no matter their age would understand the implications of doing this.


Now almost instantly I had multiple “Adults” replying telling me to “stay out of adult business”, “Let the grownups talk”, “You don’t know anything about the world and keep it to yourself”. You get the idea and at least for me this is far from the first time, so I asked why even as a 19yr old I apparently am not an adult who doesn’t know anything. I quickly got similar comments telling me to “Go back to class” and “Go play with your toys and let the big people talk alone” again you get the idea.

They preach for us to be critical thinkers and solve problems yet when we try or comment on a subject we are automatically shot down and tell us our opinions and thoughts are worthless. And then when we(or at least myself) try to point out this we are once again shot down or shoved to the side. 

I guess I am fortunate that my parents, friends, and coworkers realize this and allow me to participate in conversations and offer my views, but outside of that circle I have seen the complete opposite and it bothers me immensely that we can’t have a conversation with anyone outside of our age group without facing backlash for one reason or another.

I don’t like to say that I am depressed because I was never actually diagnosed with it and I do not want to take away from people who do have it. I know some people are so depressed that they cannot even leave their house to do their daily activities. However, ever since the start of my senior year I’ve been very sad most of the time. Right around that time I also started smoking weed. I’ve usually been able to keep it only to the weekends but there were some times when I realized I was becoming dependent on it for happiness. About halfway through my first semester at college I decided to stop for a while and made it about a month and a half without it. However, I noticed that this did not have a great impact on the happiness with life. Because of this I think that it is a coincidence that I became sad and started smoking weed around the same time. 

I have a very hard time talking about myself to anyone but I knew one of my friends takes prozac for depression/ anxiety and has seen a psychologist and used to see a therapist. So I asked him about a year ago if he felt better after doing all of those things and he said yes. A couple weeks before I asked him this I had a kind of breakdown at his house when we were hanging out (I was high at the time tho but it’s also happened sober.) and he said that he thinks I might have some kind of anxiety problem. 

About halfway through senior year I got into my first real relationship with a girl which ended up lasting about 2 months. She also took prozac but I never talked to her about it. Since it was my first relationship I didn’t really know what to do and it ended up being kinda toxic which I think was mostly my fault. I want to be in a relationship again but I don’t think I need to improve myself more first.

Now back to the period when I was taking a break from weed that same friend asked me if I was interested in doing shrooms. I was a bit scared at first but after doing more research about how they could be potentially beneficial in helping with depression/self exploration I was more interested in them. I was however scared of having a bad trip as I had just failed out of one of my classes for my major and was very stressed about that at the time. So I ended up taking a very small amount and had a good time but it didn’t affect me mentally at all which is was kinda sad about since that’s the main reason I wanted to take them.

Fast forward to present day and now I have been smoking everyday for the past two weeks. I know that it’s not sustainable for the long term and I want to try and improve my situation but I have always had a hard time actually putting my thoughts into action. I think I might want to go see a psychiatrist/therapist but since I have a very hard time opening up to people I don’t know how much that will really help me plus I would probably have to get my parents to pay for it and that would mean talking to them about it which would be very hard for me to do.

I would like to start this thread off by pointing out that I have specifically aimed my question at this sub because under the age of 30, in the grand scheme of things, we are all still in our early stages of life *to an extent*. As for the meaning of what I mean when I ask if you have ""made it"", I mean ""have you achieved what you set out to achieve in the long term?"" This may differ from person to person. If you're family-oriented, your goal might of been to get married and have children. If you're career-oriented, it might have been to get into a particular field, job, promotion, own a business etc. If you're money-oriented, your goal might have been to become a millionaire or to own the latest Audi. If you're a tech-expert, your goal might have been to have your own self-built PC or be living in a 'smart house' with clap lights. Your goal might have been to save someone's life or to make money for charity or to gain a level of fame. 

You might have multiple goals. Everyone has their own meaning of success. You might not even have a goal and are just coasting along. 

Everyone has their own goal(s) and meaning of ""making it"", and just because your goal is money-oriented and another person's goal is aimed at helping others, you do what makes *you* happy and I hope you all achieve this before you die. 

I will split this question into three categories. But firstly, if you wish to say, what is your goal you are striving for? 

**If you have made it...** Do you have another goal now that you've made it? Do you feel like you're raking in those benefits? Did you expect to achieve this so early/late? What hurdles were there on your way to success? Did/do you feel any sense of arrival fallacy? *[(Tl;dr: Arrival fallacy is the empty feeling after achieving a goal. Feeling a lack of purpose. It also can come after being disappointed that the grass isn't as green as it looked on the other side.)](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.stylist.co.uk/life/happiness-achieving-life-goals-how-to-avoid-post-achievement-depression-arrival-fallacy/335467/amp)

**If you haven't made it just yet...** How is it going? When do you predict you will ""make it""? Who is supporting you to? What will happen after? What will you strive for after? And just know, I'm supporting you!

**If you are just coasting along and living life as it comes...** How is this going for you?

I went random for my roommate and we still don’t really get along. We never fight or anything but we almost never talk. There are some days we will go the entire day without talking once. I’m more of an introvert but i talk to my close friends from high school for hours on end. I tried to talk to him at the beginning of the semester but I think he just doesn’t like talking to me.  This was fine for a while but it started to affect me. Whenever we’re in the room together it gives me extreme anxiety because it’s so silent. However he’s almost always in the room (if he’s not in class he’s in the dorm). Also our sleep schedules do not align ( he goes to bed at 9:30 and gets up at 6:30 and is very loud doing it). Because of this i’m starting to wonder if i’m just not cut out for dorm life. I think it’s too late to do anything about it this semester but I need to start thinking about next year. One of my other friends has a single and says it’s pretty nice but i’m concerned that i’d just be more antisocial locked up in my room. Also it’s more expensive so there’s that. The second option is to commute which is only like a 20 minute drive. However, I really don’t like the idea of commuting because I still want to hang out on campus a lot (but it is cheaper). The last option is to go random on a roommate again but i’d rather commute before doing this so it’s not really an option. 

Sorry about the long post and I don’t really know where i’m going with this but I just don’t know what to do at this point. I guess if you have any advice for what to do about any of it that would be helpful. Thanks!",youngadults,What to do about my roommate situation?,0.0

It’s like 2:24 AM where I’m at, I can’t sleep at all. It’s like... that state of tired that you’re *completely* wired and awake, and it sucks big dooodooballs. 

I don’t know how to feel about turning 20 to be honest, I don’t feel.. old, and I still feel like... I’m young? Like this awkward abomination of adolescence and grownup hood. But, I guess that’s okay, I definitely don’t want to be a “GrownUp”,
A sourpuss that acts like being grown is hot shit. Ya know, the whole “oh, X is for children hurr durr durr”. I think an adult is basically respecting the responsibilities you have and then doing what you love whenever you can. Like, honestly, if you’re a furry but you pay all your bills,vote,have a good job, Ect. Fuck it, wiggle that tail.

⭐️ Firstly, I know some, if not, most of you are old r/teenagers members. I want to say thank you for giving me some of the best and fun moments in my teen years, whenever it was revolting the mods and heading to r/clubteen, drawing your requests when I did those posts, or calling you guys cuties and wanting to hear your day, it was moments like these and many more that made my experience with r/teenagers almost like.. I guess a club? Yeah, a fun lowkey club. 
It’s Funny, 
I make myself laugh because I genuinely feel *obligated* to make the typical “Goodbye Teenagers” post on their subreddit, like it’s some club initiation, and then I have my perminate residency here

As for everyone, even if you skimmed down to read the ending cause, let’s be real, fuck all these words lmao 

Really,
Stop what you’re doing for a few seconds, close your eyes during that tiny sec, 
And realize how much worth you are
You’re all special in your own ways, and every contribution to society, Reddit, ect. Is all worth it
We’re all in a period of time, young adulthood, where jobs may suck, college/trade school suck, and life sucks
But realize something, you don’t suck 

Life is way to short, it’s long, but short. 
Enjoy what you can enjoy, grind to be in your happy place. Maybe your past genuinely sucks, maybe you’ve been through some ## Real  tough times that I don’t need to get into tbh, because I’m really happy you’re here right here, right now...
You better have fuckin closed your eyes for a sec

Quite personal, so I am gonna use this second account.


So I am 20 years old and currently in university.
I actually enjoy being a student. 

I still live with my parents. And its really difficult for me. They constantly are in my way, between my timetable. And stuff gets delayed. 
They also are kinda overprotective and especially my mother has really some underlying issues. She constantly does petty things. Like today she needed a paper to be printed out. She asks me to do it. I print it out and it is a bit blurred, but still readable. I dont think of it too much (its just the return page for an package) and I go back to my room and start studying for my upcoming exams. She knows that.

A bit late I am already laying in bed, about to sleep, she walks into my room (without knocking) and says, that she is taking the car the next day, because she has to drive to the store to return the package. 
She says to me, whether I walk upsatairs now and print the page with the other printer or I have to leave here. I need the car to drive to uni (its my dads car). 
She always throws ultimatums around. Not only to me, even to her own siblings. Its annoying af. But thats just one things that she does, to constantly fuck my life up. This stuff happens literally daily. 

I know for a fact that I cant have a girlfriend. They would flip out. Them flipping out isnt a big deal, I am used to it. I dont really care if my parents are disappointed in me, its my life. 

So I probably have to move out. Only problem I dont earn enough money. I get some money from my state, but not enough to pay rent and food. I would have to work.
Would love to do that, but I have a chronic illness. That constantly fucks me. Thats why I drive to uni, and not take the train. I feel exhausted when I have to ride the train 45min just to be at my uni. I need 10min. with the car.

And too much stress makes my illness worse.

I am gonna need probably around 3-4 month until I am in a position to finally take a job. A job would also make it possible to get my own place.


But until then my parents, especially my mum always fucks my head. I dont have enough space in my life for that. My exams are quite difficult for me and she just makes my life really hard. 
I slowly think about just how good everything would be, if I wouldnt have to deal with my family anymore. Their behavior makes me really sick.

What can I do to hold out that part of my life?
I may have friends, but not anyone who would really understand my situation.
I probably sound like an entitled prick. Have a car that I am allowed to drive , have a place to stay. I have a good life, but am still complaining. I dont fucking know. I just want it all to just stop",youngadults,What should I do with my life. My family is really making it difficult.,0.0

A week later, I received an email from the manager of this place (think Best Buy but crammed into a back room of the student center) asking if I was available for an interview.

Two days later, I was back at the tech store for an interview. I was honestly pretty nervous at first, but the interview went really well! I honestly got the impression that they had decided to hire me before I even showed up for the interview. They said that they were excited that I had extensive 3D printing experience since the company that manufactures almost all of the 3D printers on campus almost went bankrupt a few months ago and it's uncertain if they will continue to operate after being purchased, and they were *very* excited that I have an Android phone since nobody on staff is able to support/repair them. They even had me penciled in on the schedule before I walked in for my interview!

Fast forward to today (two days later) - I got an email at around 2:00 PM with a link to give the background check company my information, and I got a call at around 3:00 from my manager saying welcome to the team!

I'm currently living with my parents and I'm 20. I have no problem doing chores, I often just do these by default. If I see something that needs to get done, I'll do it. However I also have a very busy schedule compared to my mom and sister who are in a school full time. However I work from home full time (now, and between the 3 of us, I'm the only one that works) and have a heavier credit load then either of them, yet my mom is still asking me to do the majority of the house work.

 Without getting too into detail, my mom will often ask me to do chores as soon as I see her (before getting my coffee even..), will ask me ""are you mad"" if I don't reply in a chipper fashion and presses me for answers. I'm not a happy person and I don't really like being asked to do a bunch of things right when I get up. For some reason this has always messed up my day and just isn't a good way for me to wake up. It makes me want to retreat back into my room (which I don't really want to do because I like being around my other family members). When I've told my mom this she'll say something like : so what am I supposed to do? Which seems pretty simple to me ""just don't asked me right when I wake up maybe?"" (This never got far) 

I guess what I'm asking for is does any one know if there's any type of psychology reason as to why my reaction to ""are you mad"" , MAKES me mad, even if I wasn't before.

Up until now, I’ve been focusing on my education above all else. I’m a chemistry major with a 3.9 GPA (so far). After college, I’m going into the navy. After the navy, I’m going into grad school. After grad school, I’m going on to do overworked, underpaid research jobs for the rest of my life. It’s not exactly a glamorous, or even “successful” future, but hey- I like science. 
 

Meanwhile, I’m in my physical and sexual prime. I’m young, smooth, supple, and I’ve got a beautiful body fitting of greek divinity. I’m exaggerating a bit, but I really am in great health and great shape. I worked hard for it, and my parents gave me some decent genes. If I wasn’t so self conscious I would love to parade some pictures of my physique here. As conceited as it sounds, it feels like a waste of effort to keep my body to myself. If ever there was a time to be out there courting beautiful young women, now is absolutely that time. Call me shallow, but I just want to lose my V card and get this hormonal degeneracy out of my system before I get trapped on a boat with a gaggle of other men for the next god knows how many years. Besides, college is probably my last chance to build up social and romantic experience so I don’t wind up getting my first girlfriend at the age of 30 and being completely clueless as to how to make a relationship work. I’ve learned many useful skills over the years, but the art of love is not one of them. 
 

This quarantine has given me a lot of time to think, and I’ve decided that I *really* hate being alone. Before all this, I could distract myself by spending all my free time in the library or the gym, or otherwise some place where I could pat myself on the back for being productive and improving myself. Now that all of that has been taken away from me, I’m aware more than ever that I’m incredibly starved for love. Hell, I’ve been strongly considering hiring an escort lately, but that would kind of undermine the whole purpose of social isolation. You’d think that the quarantine wouldn’t affect someone who doesn’t tend to socialize anyway, but I’m honestly not sure how much more of this I can take. I’m ready to go out, find a party, and pretend to be a normal teenager for once. Or alternatively throw in the towel and just hit up a call girl.

And it wasn’t cause my parents couldn’t afford but my mum took ages to have interest in finding a new house. and also we can now finally invite more guests and have more freedom. I can finally let my friends stay over longer. 

Anyways I feel sooo bad cause it’s technically for me ? And they said that once I move out when I’m married which is still a few years away then they will just keep it as a guest room.
So yeah like I know some move back with their parents but I literally am moving to a new home. I wish it was a bit early lol cause we actually started home searching when I was 19 but then we were so indecisive for a year that we decided to just build one and then bushfires hazards and covid delayed it.

I believe calling 21 a kid already stretching it. But a 22 and 23 year old especially should not be recognised as ''kids'' or even close to their late teens. The demographics of even putting 18-22/23 together does not make sense. Ive seen adults who just turned 22 year olds here stating how they were still 19 ''2 years ago''. Im sure you can't keep counting age like that. Its like me saying I was 24 not long ago. A 22 year old is more closer to a 26 year old than to a 19 year old. Even more closer to a 25 year old than a 19/20 year old. You can't age down but only up. 

I feel like social media is also the reasoning. Tiktok has 22 year olds making content which I find odd personally. I mean its okay to make tiktoks just as family ones where I see parents making on with their kids but I mean acting like your a teenager is a bit weird. I think its okay to view them for memes. But why try to act below your age?Maybe its just me. I mean of course 21+ doesn't mean you need to have your shit together, even I don't but I mean its a little weird being on a platform that is aimed towards kids and teens until 19 or 20 max. I feel like once your heading past 21 its just cringe. Even seeing you tubers who are within that age group doing silly teenage things. I still do fun things like play video games here and there but I would never invest time on making social media content unless I was earning. Maybe its me but its like late 1998 -1999 born onwards seem to seperate them selves from anyone else but rather group themselves with the 2000s barely even making it to the cusp of GEN Z.  I currently went back to study law and had a 22 or 23 year old call me ''damn you old bro but its cool'' I thought to my self , I mean we are barely any different?. Allot of 22 and 23 year olds also tend to only hang out with 19-23 year olds mainly while they kinda exclude anyone whose over 25. So does the brain really not develop by 25? or is that just a western new myth. I mean why would it be 25 if the legal age starts from 21 (technically 18). I was also shocked to know Addison Rae is actually 20 turning 21. I mean she's young for now but tbh I don't see her maturing anytime soon at all but its a little odd...I feel old. instagram now has these things called ''reels'' its the same thing. Im starting to even find it odd to match with anyone below 25 on tinder cause the way they even converse is like I'm talking to a young teen.

--slight tw--

tl;dr: because I had many childhood traumas and never really coped with them, I developed toxic habits in order to feel a rush of good feeling (such as sextung strangers &amp; mimicking behavior). Stuff that makes me humiliated to even open up to people and has become a lot of self-hatred.

I'm a divorce child, bully victim from early elementary thru high school, hopeless romantic/platonic, etc.

I was terrible with friends that I split from several close groups. I became convinced that I was unstable and blamed myself for all my failures.

My perceptions of belonging became toxic that my self-image warped into something barely familiar

Thru my youthful years instead of being myself I chased others personalities because as a social recluse due to my bullying and Spectrum (it's really high functioning but it still has an influence) diagnosis I wanted to be something people would like me for.

But no one has really stuck around, I've been thru several friendships, both at school and on social apps.

More personally, ever since middle school I've gotten a porn addiction where I eventually got so bad that I would photograph myself for strangers. My sexuality become ambiguous as I believed myself to be straight yet I sent pornographic material of myself to male strangers. (I'm omnisexual, however that may've not been the influence to sext guys)

I think I just got so beaten by life that I became hyperfixated on prostituting my body to complete strangers because I wanted value. I wanted people to tell me my body was beautiful. It got so bad that I often pulled all-nighters going from user to user doing the same thing.

I only recently have been taking steps to fight it. I deleted accounts of apps I used, as well as emails that I no longer besides using them to make accounts.

After decades of a self-made hell, I'm unraveling to get the hurt out.

I feel so disgusting with how I send personal photos to a bunch of random people because at the end of the day I'm not really proud of it. It's just a compulsion that consumed me. Now it's this thornbush that's rooted deep in my soul.

I became so obsessed with improving ny image that toxicity took me over and these awful habits took form.

I would go as far as to call it freakish behavior because of how strong of a hold it has on me. I can barely breathe when it grips onto me.

I lose sight of myself and I become the me I want to bury so fucking badly.

I'm sick of comparing myself to my peers, sick of exploiting this part of me by sending photos to people I don't know, sick of becoming someone else just to be seen as measuring up. I'm fucking sick of not being me. 

People talk to me like I have nothing wrong with me, they talk like my feelings don't exist. They don't know of this broken side where I turned myself into a sexual object, a tattered soul desperate to feel like I belong. 

They don't know fucked I am.

It seems like a lot of us in our early twenties are going through the same thing. It feels like we were teenagers a few seconds ago, now suddenly we feel like adulthood is coming way too quickly, and we have no idea what to make of that. I myself have this anxiety. Like, seeing influencers who are far more successful than me, who seem older but then turn out to be 16 or 17. I get it, it's disconcerting.

Has anyone started to hate the cult of youth? I feel like part of this collective existential crisis is that for our whole lives, we've been young, we've been ""kids"", and we've been treated as inherently special and worth something just because we were ""kids."" Being the future, being the nation's/world's hope for tomorrow, yadayada. Being young and therefore being treated as incredibly special became a part of our identities and sense of self-worth, and the idea of losing that is provoking some sort of crisis where we feel like we're losing some valuable part of ourselves. 

So we're beginning feel like as we age, we will no longer be ""special"", just boring adults, and that is kind of freaking us out. And I think that's the ""cult of youth"" speaking, the idea that being young is better and being old is depressing, and your life only goes downhill as it goes on. And it's just so damaging not only to the elderly, but also to the youth who put so much emphasis on our being young, like worrying about aging can somehow stop it.

I never felt nostalgic this bad, I hate how other problems occurred during the pandemic. I never ever use to fuss about things like age ever since the past year like wtf I was 21 until the end of Last year every month went by I felt even more anxious and this stress started even more than now I’m 22.

I was 19 she was 16, I'm in the UK so thats all legal which I understand doesn't necessarily make it moral. I want to clarify that I never hit on her, I never forced her to do anything, I was never manipulative or exploitative, and I never sought her out because she was 16. If anything I prefer much older women sexually. She hit on me and we met through our parents. I'd known her since she was like 3 but we weren't that close or anything, so it wasn't a case of me 'waiting until she was legal' or something. We had just met a few times before, maybe like 3 times? We only got to see each other every few years once a year. Honestly I'm 20 now and I'd feel uncomfortable hitting on an 18 year old, they would have to hit on me and even then I would be careful about what I'm doing. Also in terms of maturity, we aren't at particularly different stages in life: she started school a year before me and I took a gap year, so I'm in my first year of uni whilst shes just sent of her applications for university. Still, even before the relationship my opinion was that 19 and 16 could be okay but I'd be weary of any relationship like that and anymore than that and its pretty much wrong. Before I entered a relationship with her I asked my parents what they thought, and they were ok with it, her only parent was practically encouraging it telling her ""I'd make a good boyfriend"", and I asked friends from 4 different friend groups who all thought it was fine, even the ones who usually find an age gap like that weird. I tried my absolute best to make sure that I wasn't doing anything immoral. Despite all this, and despite me knowing that I never harmed her in any way (we're still friends and talk occasionally), I for some reason feel a lot of guilt about it and just a lot of paranoia too. It's really really triggering my anxiety. I realised that not everyone is ok about an age gap like that, more than I thought. I might be wrong about it but I feel like people would literally hate me just based on the fact that I was in this relationship. I feel like I have to hide it or people will judge me and think I'm a creep, but I hate hiding things from people. If I do it feels like I'm lying to them. Most of those people would be fine with it when I tell them the full story, but I feel like I can't tell everyone the full story so it puts me in a tricky spot. I'm not even giving all the reasons for why I thought it was okay here which makes me feel like I'll still get judged. I feel like everyone will just see me as a creep and it makes me feel awful because thats just not me. It isn't. Anyone who knows me knows that I care far too much about the wellbeing of others and what others think which you can probably see from this post. But then at the same time, even though I know no harm came from it, somehow I feel guilty. Even though I truly loved her my gut was never there in that relationship, I always felt like it was kinda weird and it took me a bit of time to really get past the age gap. I kind of felt pressured into it by friends and family to be honest. Some of them gave me pretty bad advice looking back on it such as ""youre an idiot if you dont do anything"". Should have never listened. 

  
So I have a few questions. Most older people don't care about this at all, but younger people are far more touchy about issues like this it seems to me, so do you guys think I did anything wrong here first of all? Realistically will people judge me that badly for it if it even if I did do something wrong? Like if you think this is wrong would you dislike me on the basis of it? And what are your guys general advice on how I move forward, because this is really sticking with me and over the past few days its kind of tearing me apart. I'm supposed to be revising for my exams but its hard to concentrate. Maybe its the built in stress of that making it worse soo. I want to say that this is not something I want to hide, it makes me feel worse, so its kind of why I'm asking. I want to be able to tell people about this without coming off as a manipulative pedophile creep which I'm obviously not.",youngadults,Guilt and Anxiety over past relationship with age gap,0.0

I have ASD, OCD, and a history of social ostracism and institutionalized abuse stemming from those conditions. I am pretty high-functioning, and can pass as normal for the most part, but I was still almost totally isolated as a teenager. I always told myself that college would be when I would hit my stride, and suddenly start feeling connected and enjoying life, but just before I went to college, I suffered a the beginning of a long-standing traumatic event that crushed my self-esteem and gave me constant anxiety for years. I did not start receiving appropriate therapy until last semester, and my family was unsupportive. I promised myself that I would become more outgoing as a Junior, but when COVID hit, the beginnings of a few promising connections fell through.

I did make a few friends in college and did well academically. I did have happy memories, but they were also scarred by the near constant anxiety I felt that prevented me from living my life in the moment, happily. I did date twice as a Sophomore, and my life hasn't been a total flop. But there were never these tight-knit friend groups, or long movie marathons, or philosophical discussions at 3 am, or crazy adventures at midnight, that I had longed for but been terrified of.

I am not sure if this is allowed so I apologize in advance. 

Anyway, I am a college student and I have an internship with a hedge fund. A project I've been tasked with is helping to work on a new platform geared towards teaching people how to trade. I believe we should be targeting young adults because I believe a lot of people in my generation (or end of Millenial, beginning of Gen-Z aged people) have really been fucked by the powers-that-be when it comes to financial literacy &amp; financial independence. 

So, I created this survey to gather information from people around that age about their opinions on, openness to, and prior experience with trading on the stock market. If anyone has a free minute (or two) to fill it out that would be super super helpful! I need as much input as possible - specifically, I am looking for people between the ages of 17-26 but if you're close to those ages your input is valuable as well! 

&amp;#x200B;

On the subject, how do ya'll feel about the fact that our generation has pretty much been forced into a position of lifelong servitude? Do you actually want to have a job?

Do you believe money is necessary and if so do you think we should at least make it possible for people to survive without having a job (aka if they simply don't want to work should a person be able to have food/clothes/shelter)? I have a theory that a monetized society is no longer actually necessary but everyone thinks I'm crazy ahaha - would love to hear ya'lls opinions!

So backstory: Okay so I’ve been in allot of stress lately. I have yet to own up to past mistakes and call my friends up. We haven’t spoken for a year. I wasn’t the best person but my best friend had made me look twice as worse when she took revenge on me and exposed stuff we BOTH had said but except made me even worse and made up stuff on top and manipulated to believe I was evil. So my best friend and I used to gossip about these two friends, it all started when they would get upset if we both hung out together. After months of it happening they apologised but this lead us to continue the gossip. That was it! It’s shitty but that was it. So during the time I wanted to change as a person. My best friend had doubts which she believed and took revenge on me in the most messed up way. She exposed all the gossip we did but manipulated it to make it 10 times worse and like I was some twisted person when in reality it was just immature gossip!! Anyways those friends took my side but when they found out about the gossip they were upset. However we were about to talk to out until my best friend then made up stuff which at the point I ended up believing it and didn’t deny it!! She has apologised since. 

My other childhood friend also got brainwashed by her boyfriend. He was the one who also put ideas in my best friends head. I started to believe those things cause of the way it was manipulated. My ex best friend has apologised since but it has cost me to still have to solve stuff for something that could have been solved. But every time i try to i panic cause I get flashbacks and start thinking the evil stuff is true. I know gossiping is bad but that was it! I’m not some evil sick person , yes maybe I was shitty but not evil. Anyways what sucks is the boyfriend actually murdered my childhood friend and it sucks so bad cause I miss her. My two friends, the ex best friend and I saw each other at the funeral 3 months ago. Anyways I don’t want regrets. I wanna clear my name but also own up for the gossiping which was not nice stuff but I want to own up  and also clear the false info around it. Because in their end they don’t know that half those things said were not true since I didn’t deny it. 
So I’m deciding to call up this week although we were going to talk it out 6 months ago.

But Look guys to all my early 20 year olds (20-23ish) 
Your still really young, y’all probably still in college so make the most of it instead of worrying about age. Cause you don’t wanna think “damn I could have done so and so”. You still have a bit more to mature till 25 but 
also just know you are still very very young that once you turn 25 you won’t feel any old. And you still have your youth and trust me you will be able to do allot allot more than what you can now. So go out chill and enjoy your selves. 

To my mid 20 year olds 
If you didn’t do certain things before then it’s totally okay !!! But also realise everyone matures at their own pace. I’m 27 and I do look back only 3-4 years and feel like I was different in the way I think. In a way 19 from someone who is 21 is just their second year out of their teens. If they just turned 21 recently it’s only been a whole year. 22 is not going to be that different from the get go. Also please consider it’s only been 3 years off them graduating high school, yes allot can change then but also you don’t just change that quick. When we get to our mid 20s we not only been more years further from when we graduated high school but we likely also graduated college. Well some do and some don’t. It takes time. At 27 I have more responsibilities but I’m still extremely young to still do what I love. I make gaming videos on both tiktok and YouTube which most early- mid-late adolescence like. 
Just cause a bunch of 20 year olds don’t wanna relate to a 25 year old or vise verses just know there’s another bunch that will!

So when I was a teenager I was much more selfish, self-centered and insensitive towards others than I am now.  I was still always trying to be a kind person, but I was ignorant and unable to see how the way I acted sometimes wasn't great, and I lacked perspective.  I think that's pretty normal for a teenager and normal to grow out of.

However, what I've noticed is that I also seem a lot more empathetic and sensitive to things in general?  I never used to cry at movies or be phased by violence and emotional moments in media, but since I was about 19 my tolerance for seeing these things has just been getting lower and lower.  I cry at movies now, I get really upset by seeing characters go through grief or certain other kinds of hardship.  Sad stories on the news upset me.  I have a lot more empathy for others.  Some TV series I used to watch as a teenager are now too intense for me!  This also works in the other direction too though- I genuinely feel a lot more happiness for others and fine positive fictional stories much more meaningful.

Is this just growing up?  I've definitely been through a lot of personal stuff the past few years (serious illness and the loss of close family members as well as a toxic relationship and having a hard time at university), maybe that's got a lot to do with it too?

Even though I am ""old and in my mid 20s"", I still literally spent the majority of 2019 as a 23 year old, so it wasn't even that long ago that I was in my early 20s either. So it just confuses me more when I see people who I honestly perceive to be ""around my age"" try to group themselves away from us lol, and find minute differences between ""demographics"" to get reassurance that they're still ""young""  and not ""old"" like 24+ year olds. 

Also to me, early and mid 20s aren't super different at all. You can still party, make mistakes, and I find that people still literally go, ""Oh she's 25, of so we'll have to excuse her cuz she just doesn't have the life experience to know better."" So yeah other than a few extra years of experience of dealing with stuff, and maybe a little more maturity (which also varies a lot between people), not enough changes for the age groups people try to separate on this sub to be *that* different. 

Also, tbh once you're 22/23 you're closer to 25 than you are to 18. That is simply a fact. But that's not a bad thing at all. I do understand that many people here feel that COVID has robbed an entire year of ""youth"" away, but trust me,  us 24+ year olds feel that way too. 

And also, I guess when I 22 year olds on here say, ""Yeah I feel more like 18/19 get along with them more...25 seems too different to be associated with,"" I can't help but think that people my age were the 21/22 year olds not too long ago and those of you saying this were the 18/19 year olds. So I get curious, what will stop the teens you hang out with today/try being grouped with today from saying that about *you* in a couple of short years?

Just thought if I could get any opinions of some here or if anyone can relate. 
So very end of 2019 and early 2020 my 2 friends and I had a major bad falling out. This was due to my bestfriend taking revenge on me. Now out of those two friends 1/2 and me had some issues way before I started being friends with my best friend of 2 years. She would get upset easily if I wasn’t with her or would sorta be controlling. Now we both were wrong and had sorted everything out. She admitted that she was just upset losing me and didn’t mean to come off in a way. Me on the other hand instead of considering how she felt, I never tried. When we worked it out. It was all goods. However during this time period, my bestfriend and I would gossip about her , and I still feel so bad but I was being immature. I mean why didn’t I just reassure my friend from the beginning? Anyways 2 months later my best friend had doubts about me which were not true and in return had believed some rumours some guy had told her about me. He actually was the boyfriend of my childhood friend where he had brainwashed her as well. I had introduced my best friend and childhood friend and it’s never effected our friendship ever.  

So my best friend decided to take revenge on me and convince my friends I was evil. It worked so well that I even believed it and I ended up not defending my self. My childhood friend did it as well but it was more my best friends idea. Anyways the boyfriend of the childhood friend even made a gross rumour about me. The revenge got worse when i denied that rumour. So with the whole gossiping my best friend and I did she basically exposed all that however made it seem like I did all of it and also milked on top of it and making up stuff to make it seem like I was twisted. However those stuff weren’t true. Now beginning of 2020 my best friend had said sorry  and after a while I forgave (we aren’t BFS anymore though) anyways the thing is i feel like I no longer have a back bone. My two friends even waited to talk. But Every time i thought of apologising I started getting panicky and thinking I was evil. The best friend had even called them up and told them everything and things were okay until the drama started again due to this one thing I apparently said however I don’t remember saying that at all. The best friend had told me although she admits the other stuff weren’t true she does remember the one thing. (It seemed genuine). 

It’s been a year and the last time we saw each other was at the childhood friends funeral 2 months. (Her boyfriend had murdered her, he was brainwashing her with all her friend ) however I feel like my best friend didn’t really have that excuse as she literally believed everything he said within 1 day. No evidence or anything. She just believed it. I don’t want to lose more people. I just want to call up and own up for the gossip but also clear my name. Due to this allot of other people now see me differently all because of the best friend. Also I feel like I don’t know what’s true about me anymore ? My whole days of being 21 was so depressing due to this. I really want to call up and just tell them I’m sorry and how the stuff on top weren’t true and how I miss them. Of course if they deny me , I’ll move on. But should I just go for it ? I’ve also spent 2020 working on my self ALLOT to be a better person",youngadults,Apologising to my two friends after a year?

But this week we decided to meet again and I don’t want to push them to anything so I decided to say nothing about the time or event after we agreed, do you know what happened? They forgot and it was today. Never messaged or anything, they just act like we didn’t even decide on something, and it really broke my heart.
I wish that was the only case, I’m also the most hardworking person in our little group and I shared every little note that I have because I don’t want them to fail and I think it is fair me to say they kind a depend on my notes too. They thank me and I was fine with a simple thank but, our finals are coming and I’m attending 3 different programs beside the university classes. I really enjoy being busy but it is being really hard for me to keep up with everything because most of our professors doubled our assignments. 
So I was doing fine until today, it is my birthday and I spend my whole day sitting in a chair and preparing notes and I broke down to tears because there is so much things to do but never enough time and I’m really stressed about it, so I ask my friends “Hey, I’m preparing the notes for X class, can one of you please prepare the notes for Y class?”  One of them answered as “I study that lesson only with the readings that professor give.”  I never ask them how they work but I only ask them to prepare it for me as I’m providing the notes for 4 other classes. The other one just see the message and didn’t even reply. I really don’t know what to do, I’m feeling so betrayed, of course I know they don’t have to help me but I thought I could ask just this. 
I don’t even want to share my notes with them anymore, am I being too selfish? What do I need to do? or Do they just don’t care about me?",youngadults,Today is my birthday and my friends keep breaking my heart.,0.0

I bought my own place over year ago and I'm just renting it for now and I'm currently living with my parents. The place that I brought is literally a 8 min drive from my parents. How do I tell my family that I want to leave and become a adult. I always get anxiety about telling my parents regarding anything to do with my life things like career, they never seem to understand the things I do even after I explain it to them I would normally ignore them and carry on or force my way (I hate being a forceful person)

The main reason I want to move is mainly regarding my sleep (night shift worker) always get woken up the rest of my family (big family). My older sister (who my mum and dad look up to is adored by everyone, she's an example of ideal role model compared to my parents everthing that she said or does it right regardless of what the it is). Two years ago I was in a bad state and she helped me come back but it's been two years and in the time I've been able to buy my own place and I've proven to my family that I'm sensible person but feels like the only person I'm trying to convince is my sister. I do own a lot to her but I need to be able to live a normal life without her knowing my every movement ( literally ever move). Once in a while she'll always bring up the fact that how she helped me in my time of need and some cases to even win an argument with me. ( then she apologies to me and I just carry on as normal).

My sister (role model) came up with a solution regarding my sleep to just sleep at my oldest sister house which is just down the road and whenever I wake just come back home. I don't really want to and I don't have any excuse to say no. 

BTW my sister (role model) lives 2 hours from my parents house who has two jobs and still has time to keep tabs on ever member of the household.

23 year old here.  I wish I'd been more mature at a younger age.  Not in the sense that I want to be a 'boring adult' anytime soon but mature in terms of taking responsibility, having a good perspective on emotional matters, appreciating things more and being less self-centered.  Being more put-together as a person I guess.  I see people calling 20 year olds or even 19 year olds 'grown ass adults' all the damn time and honestly sometimes it makes me feel terrible, when I was 19/20 and even 21 I was really struggling with a lot of things and I guess I just feel like... what, do we expect everyone in their late teens and early 20s to suddenly turn into someone with the same maturity level as say a 30 year old?  It feels a bit cruel to expect that of people, especially these days where many young people didn't get as much chance to work on developing themselves as teenagers with increasing academic pressure and mental health issues.   I started with some mental health issues when I was 16-18 and I feel like it kinda... paused my development in some ways?  I didn't emotionally mature as much as I should have done because my mind was really taken up with other things.  I guess a lot of others have had a similar experience too.  And more and more I see people also saying to 'not use mental health as an excuse for being immature' and again... it feels cruel.  I've always tried to be a kind and hardworking person and I really mean that, but when you're both young and dealing with mental health problems it just feels harsh when you see people telling people to get over it essentially to and be as functional as level-headed as a healthy 30 year old.

When I see stories about people back in the 70s who got a job at 18 they could support themselves on and were in a stable relationship and thinking about having kids at 21 (younger than I am now) I feel kinda jealous? I'm ashamed of who I was at that age and I wish I'd managed to leave high school and immediately turn into a mature, 'grown-ass-adult' level-headed and mature person.  I just feel ashamed I guess.

As in I feel I’m becoming a young adult and transitioning away from being a teen. I’ve specifically noticed it with these few things; 

1. When my favorite artists release music. I used to get super excited, like I would even jump around and screech because of how joyful I felt. And now I still am excited but a lot less. I just listen as if it were a song I already know.

2. Guys. When I was 16-17 and I started talking to a guy I would fall in “love” (or at least  I thought that’s what love was) almost instantly. I always got my expectations super high and disappointed myself everytime. And I would still do it again even if I had got heartbroken previously. But now I take things much more slowly. I’ve been talking to this dude for about 2 months on Instagram. I think I like him, and we’re planning to go on a date sometime this week. And I just know the me from 2017 would’ve already simped hard for this guy.

3. Christmas and my birthday. It seems as if every year the excitement is less than the previous one. I still like these dates and I love getting gifts but I don’t look forward to them as I used to before. My birthday was yesterday (Dec 31st) and my sole reaction was “Oh ok I’m 19 now, cool”. Also could’ve been because I was absolutely hammered lmao but I digress.

For some reason I feel so sad that most of me being 21 was at Covid. I remember the more I stayed home I felt sad about being 21 since the pandemic just kept getting worse and I was like damn I wish I was 20 turning 21 Atleast. 
Now I wanna be 21 again. It’s weird cause I’ve always considered until 23/24 still being hella young until covid started now I’m dreading to even go near that age. Also since my birthday is towards the end of the year it’s crazy how I was technically still a teenager (19) just two years ago ? And my friends who are 1999 who currently 21 for a bit we’re just 19 a bit less than 2 years. I know we have a bit of change but major, I feel it’s not so much. Maybe cause the legal age here for everything is 18. 

I haven’t missed out on life but I think suddenly I’m dreading growing older. I know we are young adults and have so much time to figure shit out. But I mean I don’t really feel any differently than I was at 19 almost 20? Also maybe considering the pandemic took away 21 lmao I feel like I missed a gap. I graduate college midway into 23 as well so I guess I’m still in that mentality but so are my friends. I just feel scared things will change, my friendship group ranges from 20-22 anyway. (Very few late 19 year olds almost 20) 
But I mean we all aren’t that differently but I see so many people on reddit mentioning how the maturity gap is extreme. Only difference I see is when I was 18 in high school but I mean after when I was about to turn 20 I don’t much difference since then. But it’s also weird even dating wise I don’t think I would even date anyone a 1-2 years older anymore than me. I feel like 25/26 onwards right now is just a bit of a different life stage.

In hindsight, the 2010's were shit for me. I entered the decade an elementary schooler and am leaving an adult.

I entered my awkward phase. Moved for the first time, lost all my friends and quite frankly I was already losing the ones I had anyway. Struggled with depression, unknowingly at first. Battled suicidal thoughts. Developed social anxiety. Was pretty much a loner for most of my adolescence. Dealt with a physically and emotionally abusive mother. Was kicked out of the house a few times, recently for a month, even missed my own graduation. Tried therapy for the first time, didn't do anything. I don't think I suffer depression anymore, but I still struggle with different issues. Haven't had any real close friends or a boyfriend for the entire decade.

But I can say I'm out of my awkward phase now. I carry myself better now and have overcome shyness. I lived outside the country for the first time in my life during this decade, difficult but good experience. I've gotten my first job. Started college and although I don't have a friend group yet I'm feeling pretty comfortable there. Went to first college parties, drank for the first time. I have so many things I want to do in life and savor, while a few years ago I thought I would've killed myself by now.

Needless to say I have a lot of regrets about the 2010's but goddamn I'm happy it's over. Although I wish I was celebrating the new years at a party or something 2020 can't come sooner enough. My life feels like it's going by so fast now and I want to squeeze in as many experiences as I can for the next 10 years.

I got in to the same university almost 2 years ago but decided not to go and get a job somewhere so I can start earning. And while it's been nice having an expendable income for the first time in my life, I honestly regret not going to university a lot, and now I'm changing paths to do what I should have done 2 years ago

Actually, to say I ""should have gone to uni 2 years ago"" is kind of innacurate. I feel like I wasn't as confident as I am now, and I didn't feel like I was ready to leave my home town. But now I've grown as a person I feel like I won't have any trouble making new friends, and I know my work ethic isn't as bad as it was a couple of years ago too, so I know I won't want to drop out if I can't take the work load

I just need change now. After seeing how my twin brother has been doing at university and how many cool friends he's made and the awesome experiences he's had, it's made me realize what potential might await me in another town in another part of the country. It's thrilling to think who I might meet, what kind of adventures I might have, what it will be like living away from home for the first time of my life, and also I'll be taking the first step forward towards an interesting career path if all goes smoothly

so heres the point of this post. i have a friend from high school whos also going to university in the same country and shes getting tired of living with her family as well. she suggested we move in together when i go back in january. my initial plan was to live on campus but given the state of the world right now im not too fond of that idea anymore. i told my older siblings and it was very pessimestic ""mom and dad wont allow you"" ""its expensive"" ""what if you guys dont stay friends"" and stuff like that. i just want a new perspective.

i guess i should also note that i dont  have a job and my parents would be paying for any living situation for the forseeable future and i also havent told them about this plan but i think it would be cheaper for me to live in an  apartment long term. i would love to hear anything people have to say even if you agree with my siblings",youngadults,moving in with a friend,0.0

This gonna be a long post and I need to vent a bit so grab some popcorn or candy 😅. 

So, first a background: I'm 20 years old and I am a 1st generation Mexican-American. I was born in the U.S. followed by three younger siblings. 2 brothers; one is 16 and the other is 7 &amp; 1 sister who is 10. Both my parents 💯 full blooded mexicans who came from Mexico to U.S. for a better future. My father is an immigrant, he doesn't have any papers whatsoever so all my life I've been working hard to get to a point where I can help him to relax and have me do hard work for him cause I'm worried. My mother, however, isn't a U.S. Citizen but a U.S. Resident or something like that. 

I'm at a point where I feel like I am just now starting my life experiences like bills and car management and insurance and work all that good stuff needless to say the life essentials too like cooking and cleaning and such. But like I said I'm at a point where I feel like I'm just not ready to go out into the world 🌍, but then again reality and Life are never easy and sometimes one has to take a leap of faith no matter what. 

I watch anime and I was watching a certain one I've been putting off until now called Tsukigakirei which is about 2 main characters, boy and girl, who as you'd expect fall in love over time in their last year of middle school with plot twists and such. Anyways I was watching it and uh I started to remember my times in middle school with my relationships and how I was back then. To be honest the main male character reminded me of myself back then. Anyways I was watching it and I got to a good stopping point 🛑 and I started to ponder over my life and how it has grown and changed. Luckily it didn't evolve into an existential crisis but I was getting there. 🤯😅

Few hours later I got to work, I work nights with my father and my mother works same place but on days, and I almost always say hello to my mother. Today I did do that and we started talking about random things until she asks me one question. She says: ""What if we all go to Cherán, as a family, and stay there from there on?"" Cherán is the name of my heritage town and where my parents grew up. 

After my mother asked me that question I stood speechless, but I was able to mutter that I didn't know. But after thinking about it for awhile I wouldn't want to. As much much much as I would want to stay with my family in Cherán I wouldn't want to. Or need to for that matter. Why? Here's why

 I thought it over and over and I came upon the answer No. But i didn't know why. So let it go for awhile and kept on with my work. Here at work I a good friend I made who was actually a friend from high school we both didn't know but after we realized we become good friends. We got to talking and then he brings up that sometime in November he's moving. I don't know where but he's moving. I told him congratulations and to enjoy this milestone of his. We departed with our work and I remembered that my cousin in Carolina moved in with her boyfriend and is no longer living with her family. And I also realized as well that my my best friend is also living with his girlfriend and they're about to have a child. 

Then I remembered my first year of college when I stayed at the dorms. I was rough at first as well as emotional. But I got through and at that time I realized that at some point ny parents and siblings won't always be by my side and that I'll have to take care of myself. I payed the school bill with my parents money they were providing. They just provided the money to pay the school bill, so it was up to me to pay it up and do the rest. I also found a part time job that time and so I realized even more how, in a way, they were starting up back then when they came to America, but for then it was harder. Input this all up in my brain 🧠 and realized exactly why I didn't want to stay in Cherán. Because, I won't always be with my family and my family won't always be by me. And at some point the child has to go. I'm 20 and I need to learn how to take care of myself sure yeah but I also need to learn to mature &amp; how to take care of myself emotionally and mentally. Physically everyone know how to take care of themselves at a a young age. 

This is my reason why and if it does possibly happen it'll hurt like hell im going to be a crying bitch. And that's okay.  I might not ever see them in a long time, unless I go for vacation, but in a good way, it could also by my catalyst to maturing into the real world. One that came at a price. And even then, as time will pass, things always get better eventually.

I honestly don’t know if I should just change my political party. I was going to just change to “Democratic Party” since I live in a liberal area, but I don’t feel like I fully represent that party.

Also crazy to me how I met my boyfriend at 19 (well 2 weeks before I was turning 20) but like ima be 22 now but it’s only been almost 2 years since we been together even tho the age gap between 19 and 22 is like 3-4 years but obviously I was nearly turning 20 at that time. 😂

Idk if I’m just confusing everyone now
But I feel so sad like I was depressed about turning 21 that it went away so quick that now I wish I was 20 turning 21 again instead of 21 turning 22. I mean why couldn’t I have just been born in 1999 or 2000 instead of 1998. I know it’s barely a difference but I feel so odd. My friends who are born in 1999 are so lucky they gotta worry about turning 23 next year. 
I’m still the same as I was at 19 I mean it wasn’t that long ago but I’ve been seeing how 19/20 and 21/22 are meant to be different. Honestly I’m exactly the same and I’m still very much immature lol (of course I’m still responsible and work) but in general and tbh I don’t hate it. I just feel sad my youth is gonna end.

I don’t finish until 23 almost 24. But I’ll probably move out when I’m like 25 or married lol. But tbh i don’t mind as I’ve actually been saving allot.
But it’s weird I sometimes feel guilty, there’s allot they don’t know about me. They were more stricter in high school in a way they would keep an eye on me constantly however now it’s less and I’m able to get away with things more.
They don’t know I drink, go out and basically what most my age do.

They know I’ve been to “events “ which I would say are “uni parties” but really I’m just going to my friends parties with uni mates or I’m staying over at a friends which I am but they don’t know what happens or where we go. 
But I feel guilty I would have to make up some stuff. It’s like their strict but not which makes it worse. I feel guilty cause sometimes my dad would leave $10-20 pocket money on the table but I would secretly slip it back in his jacket. 
I’m doing well at uni and I work ! However there was a period of time I had to repeat a sem due to anxiety but I told my mum it was just a “few “ units for the sem. (I guess I’m saying half the truth but keeping quiet of the rest). I couldn’t really tell them about the anxiety as they won’t understand. But that was a short period of time and I’m back on track. Surprisingly in covid I was able to do accelerate subjects! My grades are distinction and A levels. I have a good gpa,
 however back in high school they were bad. With dating I rather tell only them until I’m sure I find the “ one “ since I ain’t trying to get arranged married lol. 

Like I don’t mind living with them cause I feel some sane, I feel like no matter my second life I always love coming back home in comfort. I help out at home. 

Another problem is with my parents is even tho they strict they lowkey kinda spoil us not literally but in a sense they do allot same as they would as you were younger. I feel bad when they get me stuff but like I wanna do this same but they never take it!! 
At the same time my household is a bit dysfunctional. My parents technically only get along cause of me. I can’t really tell them my second life things cause my mum would blame my dad (she has certain mental health stuff she won’t get help for, Long story). But the fights are sometimes really bad and honestly I rather the home stays at peace. There are some things I know I wouldn’t take from my parents but Other than that I love them so much and it’s something I realise as I get older. 

After I graduate I’m hoping to finally rent my own apartment at 25 or whatever is suitable. I have planned out my savings for the future.

My parents have had issues back then in the past and I remember most of them. I don't know what the root cause of this issue was, but  it appears that they are getting a divorce. After crying about it and letting my emotions erupt all over the place at work bathroom I've calmed myself down and have somewhat come to terms with it. For it appears my dad is leaving for Mexico for his Father.

I talked with him and he says that he won't come back. I'm still emotional about it, but I'm more concerned for my siblings. I've come to terms somewhat with this terrible milestone, but at the same time I don't know what to do with my siblings. He doesn't know when he'll leave but for me I hope he reconsiders.

So I really cried a lot last night, when some family returned from the funeral and all. And I don’t I feel sad and happy, but kinda sad definitely.


Great grandmamaa used to say travelling is best on Wednesdays and she passed away and set out on her trip to the next world on a Wednesday...


Around two weeks ago we suddenly planned a trip and booked tickets to her city, and it just popped in our hearts that we should go see her while mum is working. And goodness I don’t know how thankful I am we did.  We bought some food to eat, and some fruit as well. But the market still hadn’t gotten its daily fresh fruit so we waited a bit for the truck to be unladen and bought grapes... After the funeral we found out, that very day she asked her son-in-law to buy some grapes but for some reason they hadn’t been bought yet and voila we brought them to her unknowingly... I’m just so happy at that, I’m just so happy....


We stayed and had food with her, saw her eat well thankfully, she got the joy of seeing me reduce weight as well, she happily offered salad so I wouldn’t ruin my diet. I should’ve eaten more infront of her, she would’ve been so much happier goodness. Guys, just don those little things, like spending an extra hour with family, buying those flowers, calling up even though you’re busy. Life is so unpredictable it’s honestly not worth stopping yourself.


The thing that really broke me up was how she was worried in her last days, the family house was being sold off, she was worried where she’d live even though she has kids and grandkids in so many cities and countries. It was the same house she got married in, her children were born. She was worried guys.... and then she just passed away in the very house and doesn’t have to worry anymore. Oh no... the tears started again... I’m never going to let my mum or anyone ever worry about these things... it’s just not fair :’(


Her funeral had many people, they stopped the traffic to let it pass, there was a sweet fragrance surrounding it, similar to the one when her husband died, Im sure she’s in a better place no. She won’t feel cold like she did here. She doesn’t have to worry anymore....


They even talked about how she was happily telling people her “birdies” (me and my sister) visited her... I don’t know when I’ll stop crying but I pray I meet her smiling in a beautiful garden someday.


I’m afraid now, im so hurt and sad at this, how will I cope if my grandmum or mum or grandad or anyone else passes... I’m not ready and never will be. I just hope I go before them. I don’t have the strength, my body is already exhibiting all it’s stress signs. Guys what is life really? 

If you read so far thank you, just live happily, life is very short and you never know what’ll happen next, make it so you don’t regret it... Bless you and your hearts, I wish you a lovely life. :)",youngadults,Life is weird...,0.0

Jock, nerd, pessimist, clown, slut- whatever it is. Everyone gets one. Some people get their label from their friends. Some people get it from their enemies. Some people get it from themselves. Some people dont know they have one. But everyone does. This was what I thought when I met you.

I got my label from myself and from my friends. I was the optimist. I always tried to see the glass as half full, even if that phrase is bullshit. I tried to be the light in the room. To make someone's day better. I figured this endeavour was righteous. This was what I thought when I met you.

My world was simple. Limited, even. This was how I liked it. Everything had familiarity, nothing was out of place. If it was, it would be swiftly corrected. My world was solid, unchanging, forever trapped in sentimentality and connection. My world was simple. This was what I thought when I met you. 

You are not solid. You are not unchanging. You are fluid. A flash of light. A spark of energy. A feeble mind with no boundaries like my own. Your world is not simple or limited. Your world is vast and turbulent, changing and unsettling. Your world was not familiar. This I did not know when I met you.

Your eyes express this energy. You try to hide it, but your complexity always leaks through. You feared this. If anyone knew the excitement, the sadness, the rush you brought, they would turn. Run for their lives. Your world isn't dangerous. You're living proof of that. They just fear unfamiliarity. This I did not know when I met you.

You knew me, though my eyes had not seen you. In a way I suppose I knew you too, but my simple world kept me from your gaze. Sheltered me for fear I might escape. It was right to be afraid. And yet, this I did not know when I met you.

A label is a tag. A stamp by which all social mail is sent. Everyone can see these stamps. They adorn the corners of a soul. My label was easy to see. Everyone knew it, nobody more than I. But you didn't seem to have one. Or if you did, I couldn't see it. It was tucked away from everyone. The same as your eyes, you hid it to keep them from running. This I loved when I met you.

When I spoke to you, you didnt respond with words. Maybe you did, but I can never be sure. All I heard was music. This music, like your world, was not familiar. It was joyful and yet sad. Terrifying, yet alluring. Insatiable and yet it asked for nothing. This I loved when I met you. 

I now know my label was a false one. I am not an optimist. My quest to improve people's days with my presence was not righteous. It was not motivated out of kindness, but out of selfishness. ""I was a good person"". I knew that, so everyone else had to as well. For this I am not an optimist. I am an leech. I bleed other people in the hope that I can improve my own life. You saw that. And you still stayed. This I loved when I met you. 

I am not a good person. The only difference between then and now is I can acknowledge it. In my mind, I know this is insanity. You were too good to last. Nothing good ever lasts. And yet, in my heart, I want you to live the life you want to. As turbulent and as volatile as it might be, I can't hinder you. I'd be a leech if I did. For everything, I have to let you go.

But for now, I still love you.",youngadults,"Don't really know if this is appropriate here, but just felt like I need someone to read this.

Currently at a crossroads in my life

M(19) first off I’m in understanding that I’m in control of my life, and feel like I have a pretty good understanding that my hardships in life right now have little to no hand In the trajectory of my over all life. 
         
Recently I have come to a point, where I need to make a decision or at least in the past few weeks it’s felt like I’m looking at my life in different optional ways.  I’m 19 and if I spell it out it looks like the typical space , a lot of people around this age come to. On an internal level I’ve reached a peek in depression and social/physical anxiety letting my spd out of hand. 
          
To re account for my year , I’ve felt this down-spiral since December of 2018 ,maybe add a few months prior.  the weeks leading up to the New Years where probably the most stress filled of my entire life so far . My SO of around 3 years now , and I were in a state far better off than currently but still at an all time low .To add I had just graduated a year early from HS and was really feeling like I had the jump on life and regardless of the state I was in felt pretty good with my outlook post school .

Then I was hit with urgent news I couldn’t really handle. My relationship with keeping up to date this my fathers status of health and well being was very poor, as had been our entire relationship. Out of contact even once he had started undergoing chemotherapy for a high stage of pancreatic cancer , we had not  been on frequent speaking terms since I was 8 years old. Now brought to it me it was very evident his state of life was deteriorating 
I felt like I needed to be on good terms or use his time left to fix all he had broken about me , instead things got rapidly worse and I took care of my dying father untill his day of passing on his birthday, New Years.

 Traumatized and emotionally gone, the months after I nearly ever spoke to anyone , let alone anyone about how I felt . I let the conversations with my significant other , push my feelings and mental attitude around his passing into a corner . Her hatred (In her words ) for what feels like all men allowed my self to only validate the violent emotion I had prior. 
My true one and only friend now (A), lives city’s away ,fleeing  from our hometown in an abusive relationship on track to start at a university . Their entire situation has changed and they are all behind helping me make some of my own critical life decisions.

Now I currently attend a community collage three terms in, on track for a transfer degree for my bachelors at a university, I live with my mother and her partner(given) more than ever I feel all the pressure to move out , my partner wants us to be okay enough to move in together . Awhile her reasons to move out and stressors from home life feel like they pile on me, I understand my privilege and opportunity to help them . It just feels like even if she loves me , I’m being used  violently used as a step up to stability in life (her words)(to A)she’s got nothing in her pocket to show for the abuse we have put one another through .
She feels I have harmed her this entire relationship but by the way she has presented that and become so radically verbally abusive to me I feel she is, even though I understand and validate the reasons she vocalizes everything

The abuse she feels I’m putting in is mental and I understand what I’m doing I’m taking space on technology from her while both of our schedules become more stressful so we rarely see one another(typing this )  it’s my word over hers but all our relationship has been is her telling me how I feel and how to do differently and me immediately apologizing witch is invalidated already . 

Im allowing my self to sure come slowly to failure , (as I write this skipping my first class of the day) . I have zero desire to attend school at this point ,over that the feeling it has given to my life feels like something I don’t want to persist in .I really do love my job , I have great co workers and it’s a place I can Unregretfully be my self ,witch sistuationally feels like it damages my schooling and relationship:ie drinking after work or perusing relations with my co workers.

Currently I don’t know what to do I want to drop everything drop out and move to where my friend is living at the moment to assess my better living of life. I also really love this person I’m with but even after typing all of this it seems evident we will come to an end I just want to keep on loving them in the right way which I understand may not happen.

I feel like I'm somewhere I can be happy with myself. 

The problem is, my friend. He is used to us talking casual shit back and forth between each other. And that is all fine, but he has started calling out assumptions that undermine my progression and improvement. He makes me doubt that I really did improve. He is fully aware of my struggles and knows what I've worked on fixing. 

I have pretty much ghosted him the last few days, he tries to pretend like nothing and start up a casual conversation. It is hard to ghost someone you live with when you live in a 30 square meter apartment. I told him my main problem 3 days ago, and he manages to just keep on doing the same shit the day after.

I heard someone inside, then heard a couple normal knocks after that, then it was silent for 10 minutes. Keep in mind I haven't seen or heard my roommate here for over 2 weeks, and we didn't exchange numbers because I've only briefly spoke to her and moved in last month. I was mainly concerned because the roommate would not obnoxiously bang on the door and then use her key to open it, and I didn't hear any keys. 

I google if I should call the police because I'm not totally believing there's an actual bad guy inside, and if so, why *my* place, these apartments are very safe but technically the ""ghetto"" is less than a mile away. 

I ended up calling the nonemergency number for a nearby town because the nonemergency for my own town was a 1800 number and for some reason I felt weird about calling that. I tell the guy what happened, and I'm like it's possibly my roommate, like I repeated that a few times, because I didn't want to make this a big deal and was hoping they would just sent an officer for a quick check or something. He transferred me to the 911 in my city, and I told her the same thing, I'm not sure if someone is in my apartment or if it's my roommate. The reason I didnt go check is because I'm not going to jeopardize my safety in case it seriously was a killer. 

About 5 minutes later my roommate opens the door to the police, so I was relieved that she was here, but they sent over 20 officers and they were all crowded in the hallway and in the doorway staring at us and I'm still kind of confused about the heavy knocking because my roommate was like ""No I also heard that and I wasn't sure what was going on and asked my friend to check on me"" so the officers were like rolling their eyes at us and were probably like damn what a waste of our time, and I felt bad but I told the dispatcher like 5 times I'm not totally sure and said *I don't want to make this a big deal* and it's not my fault she sent like half of the police dept. 

But wait, there's more!

A couple minutes after they left, 2 security patrol ladies talked with us, they are the designated patrol officers for my apartment, and here's what happened:

A pizza guy was trying to find someone with the same name as my roommate and was knocking on the wrong door. He told security he needs to just get this pizza delivered and go to his next place. Security woman is like oh yeah buddy I will sure help you, by fucking trying to knock our door off the hinges by banging on it. So she was the loud door pounder. I essentially called the police on the police. I also had no idea we had security. I also think the door opening sound was my roommate opening her bedroom door to see the knocker. 


I was super embarrassed, but I made sure to get my roommate's number so that if I ever hear any shady things going on at night I can just text her and be like hey is that you",youngadults,open this if you wanna hear about how I thought someone was breaking into my apartment [long],0.0

He even unlocked his phone and gave it to me when I asked him if I could see his phone. He doesn’t mind when I “steal” his hat and take it home. I even put stickers on it and he hasn’t taken them off. We also will trade hats from time to time and he doesn’t mind it. Since I have his number we text a lot and I found out we have some of the same interests. Idk what to do, I want to tell him I like him and see if he likes me back. But on the other hand I don’t wanna find out cause if he doesn’t like me I don’t wanna find out... what do I do???",youngadults,I need help with my crush,0.0

 I've done volunteer work and some odd jobs in my teens, being paid under the table. So interviews, orientation, clocking in &amp; out and training is pretty new to me. 

Anyways I just got done with my last day of orientation and I start my actual shift next week, which I'm both nervous and excited about. But, I'm just so happy this part is over, because orientation was boring and I hate getting up early, hence why I applied for 3rd shift. 

So to reward myself after work this week, I bought 2 subs from Subway, mozzarella sticks and jalepeno bites from Arby's and a drink. which I usually don't do, but A: I was hungry as frigg. And B: I said ""FUDGE IT, I'M GONNA SPLURGE."" 

So I got to enjoy a perfect feast and some t.v in my pajamas and got to take a nice nap. Absolute heaven with my two days off tomorrow and Monday 🙌 and I'd recommend this to anyone lol

I've tried most of what people recommend for feeling better such as going to therapy, hanging out with friends, taking anti-depressants, sleeping enough and eating well, getting a routine, finding things that you enjoy, going out of the house etc. None of those things have really done much other than make me want to go to school and study hard.

Whenever I go to therapy I just leave feeling more frustrated knowing little that I talked about is going to make me feel any better because my reality will not change. I don't know why, but I'm surrounded by people and friends yet still there's a hole in my heart that never feels accepted or loved, I still feel alone. Some of my friends claim I'm an alien because of how inhuman, alien-like and weird my behavior is. Medications do little but kill my sex drive but since I don't have a sex life and likely never will, that doesn't really matter. Sleep and routine kind of help but there's always things to make me frustrated, such as not being smart enough, not getting the results you want despite working hard (I'm the kind of person that works and worries 3 times more than the average person only to get mediocre results). I eat as healthily as possible, but there's some things flavor and texture seldom replace.

I've found things I enjoy but those things don't make the pain disappear or reduce. They don't make me want to live more than the pain makes me want to die. I like programming but before the temporary happiness of coming at a solution there's days of frustration, anxiety, hopelessness, anger at one's stupidity and incompetence and banging your head at a wall to find another way. I guess in a way this pain is escape since it's a deep personal productive pain unlike moping around in bed accomplishing nothing.

I've gotten a lot more social this year in order to fix my loneliness, I met a lot of fellow students from my university's discord server, I tried joining a club (left it soon after because it was too stressful). It seems that whoever I meet I have the same problem, there's no spark, no life, just a fake interaction and I'm lonely. Social interactions are a double edged sword, sometimes I'll meet a nice person, the other time I'll look at couples and normal people being so happy and cheerful and that just makes me feel worse for being the way I am.

I'm not going to fail all of my classes like I did last semester but I come home everyday miserable and feeling empty inside, I don't know what I can do more to try to feel better. I doubt I will survive in the future either since I can't spend more than 7 hours awake without feeling like a dead zombie.

The only time when I don't think about killing myself is when I succeed at something personal or when I'm sleeping, and since I can't have the first one all the time, most of my waking existence is like having hot knives piercing me. Guess suicide is my best option, to end it all rather dramatically since there's only so much someone can take - the Spartans eventually fell at Thermopylae. Maybe I should send this spiel to my parents so they'd think of something other than ""think positive"" when they see my dead body.

I always feel so tired and sad everyday. I decided that I aspire to be a vet in the future when I was 14 years old because I realized that it may not be possible for me to study paleontology. I realized that I have to obtain a high grade in order to study Vet Science in all universities, not to mention there is only one university that offers this subject in where I am living. I hope to study overseas and immigrate to other countries but it would cost a lot if I want to study my dream subject. I am starting to regret that I first told my parents and my teachers that I wanted to be a vet. I wish I hadn't dreamt. 
For my dream job, I study. I attend tutorial classes like every other students do. I didn't meet any of my friends in this year's summer holiday, nor did I go out and have a hike. The only relaxation I had was playing a video game behind my parents' back. I am scared of my parents. I cannot do anything except studying. I am starting to feel unmotivated to study and it is actually exerting adverse effects. 
There are also mass protests in where I live. I wish I could do more to support the movement. However, while my parents also support the movement, they don't allow me from joining the protests because ""I have to study"". I feel like I am a selfish being. 
There are people that have the worse situation than me and I know it. I won't brag about my situation. I just feel like I am living everyday tired and unmotivated.

I go to my local community college I bombed two semesters and put myself severely behind my peers but recently have gotten the hang of school and have been realizing it as a priority. But I still have no idea what to do when it comes to a degree or wether or not to transfer to an actual Uni when I get my associates. Even that opens a can of worms because do I go out of my city for uni or choose to stay at the one near me? I’m worried that I’m stuck and I can’t find a way out because I have no plan or goal in mind. Everyone I know has a career in mind that they are passionate about but if I’m being honest I just want a job where I can make the most money to fund hobbies and live comfortably my main goal in life since I was in middle school was to own a Porsche 911 some day. I make minimum wage and still live at home I pay for my own bills but still feel like I’m mooching off my family and I feel bad. This has been more of a rant than anything but is anybody else in the same boat? I really hope I find a way out of this rut. I know lots of people have it way harder than me and don’t even have the ability to attend school at all or own a car or have a roof over there head so I also feel like a giant douche for being upset about my situation but it gives me a ton of stress and anxiety for my future.,youngadults,Am I supposed to not have any idea of what I am doing with my life?,0.0

Anyway, I’m in very weird place in my life rn, and idk how to feel about it or what it even means (vague ik, trust me it’s just stupid relationship angst with a person I’m not even in a relationship with, most likely I’ll be over it by tomorrow).

But you know what, shit’s annoying when you like a person, you tell them, they end up telling you they also like you back a few days later, and nothing happens. Better yet you also feel awkward for attempting to bring it up again because maybe they changed their mind.

Honestly as long as I’m still friends with them, that’s fine. But idk if they still like me back in that way, or to the same extent I do. Plus I’ve been blowing off irl opportunities with other girls because of the off chance I could get into a relationship with this person. 

My angst side is wondering if I’m losing out on potential irl casual dating opportunities because I’m fixated on this one person who said they liked me back once, but also doesn’t seem to show it.

These past two days have made it irrelevant pretty much. Yesterday, I checked up on my friend who I haven’t talked to in a few weeks. She said that she’s been trying to talk to me about what’s going on in her life and that I wasn’t there for her. That really hurt me because I was idk about now, one of her closest friends and have been there for her before. This time, I wasn’t there for her. It really hurt me and I still feel horrible about it. That same day, my dad tells me my grandma from PR, has been in the hospital for the past two days because of a stroke. 

Today I had a pretty rough day at work. And I just broke down when nobody could see me. Bad thing was that my eyes were really red after the fact, and people noticed. I had people there for me, which really meant a lot to me. I feel better now. My grandmas blood pressure still hasn’t stabalized, but should be home when it does, which is awesome. I’m feeling better now. I guess the crying that I did earlier, made the pain feel a little less irrelevant thankfully. I drank water, and ate. I’m in a better mood than what I was feeling two hours ago. 

Point I’m trying to make is this:

I’m 20 (Idk how to change my flair on mobile). It’s ok to cry. It’s ok to cry after a rough day. You have people to support you. Holding in my tears caused more pain for me, than actually letting them all out. Don’t be embarrased to cry when you really need to. We’ve all been there before.

About 9 months ago I joined a community to make friends to game with. I had just gotten back into gaming and met some cool people, everyone was nice and respectful. I started talking to one guy sporadically and didn't really think much of him, he was kinda funny but it was all platonic and I'm not really picky about who I talk to online.

I honestly didn't talk to him a whole lot and then quarantine happened. I had far more free time for games and shit, started using discord more, and started sending memes and playing games with said guy. Needless to say things started hiking up and now we really, really like each other. I've never been in a relationship or even fallen in love either online or irl. I'm 19.

Problem is, he lives in central Europe (he's American, like me) and I live on the west coast. I want to visit him this summer once covid cools down, I have more than enough money and all my summer plans were ruined by covid. I would stay with him from about halfway through the summer until my university starts, well over a month.

My biggest barrier is I have no idea what to tell my mom about going to fucking Europe for the summer. If I wasn't living with them because of covid I'd just say I'm doing study abroad and have her meet him along the line, but since I'm back home and she knows all programs were canceled it's harder to weasel my way out. I've had no interest in going there before, I'm not the type to go out in general. This won't be my first time living abroad and she fully supported my international travel before, but that was with a reputable program and she talked to the people I was staying with.

He is older than me and already has a masters which might make her uncomfortable, not to mention we met online and my mom is, after all, a boomer. I have plenty of money to make do in case things go bad with him, we've videochatted, and I don't think he has any ulterior motives.

I am 20 now and I am leaving home soon for university and things are going well.

In junior college I sat next to this boy named Faisal bin Mohammed (not going to share the full name for privacy) and was like head over heels in love with him because we had extremely similar personalities. He did not feel the same way about me but liked me as a friend. I was okay with that and we were getting along well. We were planning for our siblings (I have a 14 year old brother and he has a 15 year old brother) to hang out and play video games. He confided in me that people had bullied him and called him a terrorist because he is from Saudi Arabia, which I could relate to because my family members had said that I would end up killing someone because of my schizophrenia and BPD.

He was new to our city and didn’t know about how I was before I made an effort to improve. Then some kids who knew me in HS and go to Faisal’s mosque (Sara and Hamza) were telling him about how I used to speak like Carrie White and how I once was bleeding from my scalp in class due to self inflicted burns.

We reconnected two years ago and I know a lot of stuff changed for him, but I always felt stuck in place. I was living in the past, wishing it was like it was before whenever we had no worries or responsibility, and wishing he was like the person he was before when he was a teenager.

We finally arranged to eat lunch together yesterday. However, we didn't get to catch up because of his insane working hours. I'm not going into details, but it wasn't what I was expecting. I had spent 2 years dreaming about the time we'd meet again, wondering what it was going to be like and convincing myself that things would be the same as they were back then. It wasn't, and I've realized that that's okay.

For the past two years, and still even now, I feel nostalgic all the time for a better time, and I find myself wishing I had done more years ago. I felt like I was the only one who was stuck in place, who hadn't changed. My best friend from primary school-middle school moved on and we drifted apart, all my emo friends from middle and high school have moved on, and it seems like everyone's getting married now. 

My childhood friend has also moved on, and although it seems like not in the best place, he's dealing with it his own way and I've accepted that one day, he'll start moving again.
 
I'm glad we got to spend time together, even if was just a little bit or if we'll never get to do it again. Life moves on, and spending it living in the past is a sure way to make sure you get stuck in place. Everyone's in a different place in life, and things change. It does no good to remain in the same place you were at 10 years ago.

Over the past 2 years, I started out as an over-practical, borderline sociopathic edgy kid with zero real friends, to becoming extremely depressed feeling like I was going in a downward spiral, to spending most of my days romanticizing an interaction that may/may not have happened, all while feeling like my life had become stagnated, and I wasn't really moving forwards or living. I was just existing and couldn't wait until the end.

Now, I have finally found something I'm passionate about, I've started working on a project, found a group of friends who're awesome to be around and talk to whenever I visit them on breaks, I met my amazing boyfriend who I can be myself around, and I'm living every day to its fullest. I finally feel like I'm living my life and moving forwards. The last time I felt this way was around 5 years ago, and although that number looks small it feels like a long time.

I recently had an interaction with an irl gatekeeper who tried to convince me that I was going through an existential crisis about my belonging to a certain generation, but it was clear to me (and my friend who took me to meet her) that she was the one going through the crisis, was insecure about her age and position in life, and that's why she was trying to drunkedly gatekeep me. According to my friend, she's the kind of person who wants everything to be in their place and believes everything is set in some way, and she over categorizes everything in her life. I understand this, as I was this kind of person some time ago, and needed to categorize and be in control of everything. I've finally accepted that this is just one phase in her life, and she will eventually be able to move on, even if it's not anytime soon.

There are people I've interacted over the years who still know me as many different people, but I've learned that it doesn't really matter. All that matters is that I finally feel alive, and I know what I'm supposed to do.

I was told of a story of a professor and student who had a very close relationship and emotional connection. One day, the professor tells the student that he has one more lesson he wants to teach her, then disappears. She tries to find him, but no one seems to know where he is. She eventually realizes that she cannot spend her entire life living for him, and the moral is that living in the past, or in a ""shadow"", will only make you become a shadow of yourself.

""The only way to survive is to constantly evolve."" It's a motto I live by and really appreciate now.

I'm a young dude still in education. At some point, I will be entering the workplace world. I've had plenty of internships (one of which helped me build a sort of connection:) ), am passionate, know how to write good resumes and co ed letters, have a lot of skills, and am hardworking to a fault. So, in order to be more prepared for the future, I started looking at jobs and job search sites. Normally, this would be pretty good, especially for a guy who struggles with anxiety and autism. However, even before covid hit, all I could find when I searched about job info all I could find were things like 3 years of experience needed for entry level positions, reports of people sending out hundreds of resumes for a single interview, terrible employers destroying benefits and slashing salaries. I'm assuming y'all know what I'm talking about. But simply, every bit of info I could find relating to finding a job makes even my nominally bright outlook and position seem terrible!

Horrible things happened while growing up, but I didn’t let it affect me the way others let it affect them.

And now, I feel bad because people told me that it’s because I have an “easy life” or I don’t have responsibilities.

I had to move out when I turned 17 years old. I’m 21 now, I have a child and a wife to provide for. The area I live is super expensive and has horrible pay, my hours are being cut so I gotta find other ways to make money, I’m slowly building up an automotive business that I’m trying to progress through trial and error, I have student loans, bills, rent to pay every month, I have a lot on my plate, genuine reasons to stress out about, especially as a man, father, and husband.

But even though I have a lot on my plate, I either pray or study the philosophy of stoicism, which I truly believe that it has helped me control my emotions. That’s why I haven’t had a mental/emotional breakdown.

He was able to get a free ride to a community college if he maintains a C average, and he said he wanted to finish his degree by going away to university after completing his first two years  here. He also has a relatively easy job working 30 hours a week. 

He’s been settling in his new room but I’ve been noticing he hasn’t been doing any schoolwork (it’s all online due to Covid). He said he really wishes he could attend in person, meet new friends, etc. I’ve asked about it a few times and he seems to avoid the subject. Last night, I asked how things are going and he randomly logged in and found that he received an email from one of his instructors saying he needs to drop the course or else he’ll fail it. I suggested he at least contact his instructors to let them know he’s been moving this week in hopes that they will give him options to complete his work. He got upset with me and didn’t speak with me for the rest of the night. Up until then, he was confiding in me and seemed very happy. 

Did I overstep? I don’t want him to lose the scholarship because I know he’ll regret it. I would never nag him because I just want to help and support him, but maybe it came off that way.

-a day when he doesn’t have work or anything important I can put make up on him and fake stick on nails (done that before but he wasn’t fully asleep)

This is more or less how it's going and what I've realized about myself over these last few months. I'm making this with the intent that some of you can learn from this or even uses the mistakes I've made to better yourself.

To understand the story of how I got to this point you have to understand my Upbringing. You see I don't exactly come from good people. It took me a long time to realize this and to be completely honest with you it still hasn't sunk in properly. my real father is a wife and child beater that didn't care about anything but himself and what he could gain by using you. my mother is a nice person upfront but is a manipulator and a bully for a lack of a better term, that being said she never laid a hand on me and tried to do her best. That still does not excuse her actions on how she was. My stepfather is the only person I can truly say was a good parent to me even if he had his own screw-ups with him serving in the military. he wasn't kind or forgiving. he belittled be and did make me feel as though I was an awful person, but I feel I wouldn't be the person I am today if he didn't push me to not be that kid that went and hid even if he didn't do it in a good way, but to be fair I wasn't exactly the nicest kid.

With all these negative influences surrounding me, I never knew how to act. I would through fits, get in fights for no reason with them, and shut people out just for talking to me. on top of all that I would deliberately lock myself in my room just so I didn't have to talk to anyone because I thought if I did that no one would have to deal with me. I would have trouble sleeping because if I wasn't up when my parents were up I would get the power in my room shut off so I learned the sound of their footsteps and would make up instinctively right before they opened my door.

There's more detail in between but I don't want this to be ten pages long. From all that about 6 months ago I moved into my grandparents to try to better myself. I lived with them when I was younger because I felt safer there and after my parent's divorce we ended up living there anyway. They are very kind and supportive and see where I fall behind and just want to see me be the best person I can be. We made all our friends there too. it’s been a positive experience overall and my mental health has gone up a lot and I'll be going back to school again. while living here I've noticed things about myself that I didn't know were there till I started acting more human for lack of a better term.

I had my first dream since I was thirteen, four months ago, it was a strange experience and I cried when I woke up not because the dream was sad but because it was the first time since I was thirteen that I felt safe enough to fall into a deep enough sleep to dream in the first place. I didn't realize how important it was till I got it back and how much just feeling safe can have on a person. it's surreal for me to think that a year ago I was thinking of killing myself and just a year later I can feel safe again.

The biggest challenge I'm facing at the moment is social interaction or just making friends in general. I know how to put on a fake smile and act normal for the most part. but what I'm working on is not being fake and just trying to be myself. my only problem is I really don't know where I begin and the fake me ends. it's frustrating to try to be yourself when even you don't know who you are, to begin with. right now I'm just trying to talk to random people and just be as real as I can be. Finding myself is something I never thought I would be doing let alone struggling within this way so it’s a hard realization but one I've come to expect.

on the lighter side of things, I've got myself a car and a job that fits with the career path I've chosen. it was hard when I didn't have a job for almost a year but I got right back into things. I recently started hanging out with old friends I had here. although we have nothing really in common its a good jumping-off point. on top of all that like in said earlier I’ll be starting back up in school again so I can finally chase the degree I've always wanted. My hope is that I continue in this upward spiral so I can continue bettering myself and those around me.

To sum it all up I made this post to get my raw feelings and emotions out in the open. I've never really opened up to people, or at least as long as I can remember so I'm doing this to get myself more open to talking and hopefully soon have the courage enough to see a therapist that can give me professional help because opening up to a screen to random people on the internet isn't the best way to do it. if at all possible even if you hated this, liked it, or even found that you could relate to some of my problems please just remember this. Even if hell seems to be knocking at your door and you have nothing else just remember there’s always a brighter tomorrow.

Since I got out of high school, my parents were getting divorced around the same time. So adulthood was already looking TASTY. I didnt have a place to live so I chose to live with my dad. Then I lost my security job, and got hired as an electrician with my dad. I now work, and live with him. First 6 months were okay. This is where the story gets detailed. 

So me and my father have an obvious gap in pay, he makes 900 a week, I make 400. I try my absolute best to help him and he obviously still has to pay a lot of the Bill's. But I make enough that nobody can claim me on taxes. So my mom ends up in a horrible situation and she has to surrender some assets to the bank to help settle debt. She obviously is not in a good position, so my mom moves in. A whole bunch of arguing. Then my deadbeat 24 year old brother moved in because he gets evicted for the 2nd time in 4 years. And yes, they were both his fault. 

Brother moves in and things get far worse. Tension between divorced parents and an older brother that is so stupid that he thinks he is genuinely correct about everything. There is no point of return beyond this stupidity. He thinks that not flushing the toilet doesnt make it dirty. My father blatantly thinks that because we are over 18, his role as a father is complete. He feels more like a shitty roommate than a father at this point. 

Now it's gone to work. I took on a job field that I've never working in or had training. It's been 1 year and it now seems like everyday is a contest to see how stupid they can make me look, regardless of if what I did was right or wrong at work. It's a contest to them. 

Now my brother has gotten to a point of laziness that he has had his car repossessed. His only bills were rent and his car payment. Literally everything else is paid for. Mother moved back out thank god. Then my brother's girlfriend moves in and its 2x worse now. We cant buy groceries because she eats it ALL and doesnt pay a dime to live here. I'd say she could do the chores around here to make up for it, but shes 24 and cant use a dishwasher, has broken our dryer, AND WASHER, and leaves trash everywhere just like him. 

It's now all at a point that I cant call anything home. I'm afraid of saying anything cause it sparks an arguement. The family is no longer family. My close family only wants to fight, and my distant family is full of racists and rich assholes that havent even showed up to an elementary soccer game. 

So now it's all just boiled over. I got in an arguement with my dad. He thinks that Bills are the key to it all. Since he helps pay bills for us that our relationship is to be magical. Even though my entire income is going towards bills at this point. I'm the only one that helps him yet I get all the backlash. I pay rent, internet, help w groceries, my car, and even pay the difference for car insurance.   I dont know what to do at all.  I'm seriously considering abandoning this life and starting new. No family. Nothing. Just me and my dog. Nothing here wants me.",youngadults,21 and family has completely fallen apart.

She is super sweet and spoils me with great food and she has sweet pets.

I'm very ADHD with a lot of energy... I need a lot of stimulation. There is so much love here, and I am grateful, but this is not a great match. I'm really bored. I'm in a place where I don't know anyone, and there really isn't any way to meet other people here. I feel like I'm in isolation here. Even her street is a dead-end street, you never see anyone outside, no families just small apartments with mostly seniors.

I usually get to spend time during the holidays with my younger cousins (kids, teens, 20s) who are always busy and active, take me out with them, and there's constant back-and-forth banter... I love that and miss it bad. The companionship and they're super curious about my life and vice versa.  Video games with each other, hoops, wrestling and goofing around or just talking about life. It's very social and high key when I'm with them, no matter where we go or what we do.

I feel guilty about feeling down this Christmas, and I know it shows. I really just need to find stuff to do so I can be in a better mood when I'm around my aunt. I feel like she could think I'm ungrateful or that she's done someone wrong. She already got frustrated with me and asked if ""I expect the world to entertain me."" She thinks her quiet corner of the world is just perfect and can't understand why I would not feel the same way.

I've tried going out to bars by myself and that is just no fun, also I'm not a drinker (as in 1 drink is enough.) Bars are fine with friends, but not solo. I've tried other solo excursions and just feel worse. Doing things by myself for the whole holiday season just isn't appealing. I am not great at approaching people and starting a conversation.

A pleasant week for my aunt involves the grocery store, church, volunteering at her church, sitting at the library, taking the recycling to the drop-off center, and watching TV each night. It's insanely boring for me. Plus, she's very independent and doesn't need or want help shopping, cooking, cleaning, etc. I just have nothing useful or interesting to do.

Any ideas? I'm within 80 minutes of Chicago downtown and within an hour of a lot of suburbs. I like sports in general, playing pool, pickup basketball (not good though), conversations about tech and news and sports. I'm game for anything where I could meet people who want to meet people, if that makes sense. I feel like I'm searching aimlessly and can ""try"" driving to all sorts of places, but holiday week hours are unpredictable and there's no guarantee it'll be worth the trip. I'm probably looking at 45-90 minutes of drive time, and my budget is limited, so I feel like I need to make good choices and not just be aimless about picking places to go.

Thanks!",youngadults,Holiday boredom,0.0

I have 2 sisters both older than me, and I was fortunate to be in the foster system with one of them all my life. This isn’t too important though. I graduated from high school when I was 17, and moved out on my own and started working full time. The fostering system’s people said they’d send me X amount of money every month to help me out. They did not. I know quite a few foster kids and I’m the only one that got fucked over like that. No matter, I’m a strong person, I’ll do it on my own. Hell I got me my first truck on my own. I worked and paid my own rent, and worked to pay my bills with my roommates/best friends (they were a couple). They broke up, one moved out, and work started slowing down for me and my remaining roommate. This wasn’t the worst thing that’s happened. I just went hungry sometimes. I figured out that distracting myself w video games would make me less likely to notice the hunger... I honestly don’t know where I’d be without my ps4. I survived. Work picks up and my best friend develops an addiction to cocaine... I don’t really know what to do at this point... most of my life has been spent avoiding conflict/confrontations... I just hide in my room and smoke weed as my best friend goes out and fucks up his life... truck breaks down, gotta sell it. Makes bad purchases, lends the wrong people money which I never see again, and I don’t know what to do. My parents are literally strangers to me, one sister doesn’t talk to me and my other sister... well her and I have a special relationship and I don’t want her to worry about me,  I have no one to talk to about what I should do regarding my coked-up friend because that friend was the only person I could talk to... eventually I try coke with them, and I just start talking. I start telling my friend off for snorting blow, and then we get in a fight... at the end of it he says fine I’m gonna move out. I cried. I literally can not afford rent by myself, and I have no one... no one to come through to help me out... I often hear people complaining about shit that their parents did for them and I’m jealous. Almost everything I have I got myself... my truck that I had I paid for it myself, registered and insured it myself. My foster parents didn’t even let me park my truck in the driveway when it wasn’t registered. Fast forward a few months, I’ve taken a heavy equipment operator course, but I’m only 18 years old with minimal experience... no one wants to hire me.

I am already for sure going to fail one class. I’m on the edge of failing another, though I think my final project will boost me up. The other two I have C’s in and I’ll be fine if I don’t fail the exams. 

The classes aren’t hard. I’ve just been going through severe mental health issues and ADD. I’m finally on medication for both, and it saved my ass just in time for finals. I would’ve probably failed all my classes if I waited any longer before getting on meds. It’s so much easier to get through life now, but before I was pretty much disabled and trying to live my life as if I wasn’t. 

I’ve struggled with dysthymia (chronic depression) since I was like 12 or 13. Age 16 up to now has especially been a struggle (I’m 21). The first two years of college I was hanging on by a thread, not doing any work but cramming at the last minute, choosing the easiest professors and memorizing material by rote when I went through depressive episodes. The thing is, I’m really smart so I can get through it this way. If I didn’t have mental health issues I probably could’ve gotten into an Ivy League college. That’s what everyone kind of expected of me when I was a kid. Top of my class, daughter of a physician. So with depression, I was getting B’s at a state school. 

I just couldn’t do it anymore. I gave up. I pretended I knew what I was doing with my future when people asked me, when in reality I couldn’t even get up to bathe myself. I was numb the first couple of months of school. It was fine. I wasn’t doing my work. Out of sight, out of mind. 

I just didn’t give a fuck anymore. I didn’t want to succeed. I didn’t see the point. All I wanted to do was lie in bed for an eternity. I didn’t realize how bad it was until I recovered. I was talking to myself a lot. Recklessly driving. I thought about checking myself into the hospital a few times but I didn’t have the wits or the energy. I was just very confused all the time. I would walk out of class just to go to the bathroom and stare at myself in the mirror. It would get to points where I would talk to my boyfriend and all I could do was stutter the same words over and over again. 

The hardest part, though, was just how invisible it seemed to everyone else. I couldn’t express my problems well enough to anyone to get anything accomplished. I’m wondering now if I had some kind of delusions. My mind was so fragmented. 

Anyways, that is the past. I am on a new medication and it has been a miracle for me. My mind feels glued together again. It’s easier to get up and do things, to talk coherently, to remember things, to feel ok. I don’t always feel sick and tired anymore. I am so so grateful. Just in time for the holidays, as well. 
I have finally forgiven myself for everything. I am not horrible to myself anymore. 

I don’t really know what the point of typing all of this out was. It just feels good to tell someone, to know I’m not being dramatic. I have been through a lot, and now I can finally admit that to myself. Before, I felt like it was just an excuse. Like I could change, like I was just being lazy. It was far more than that.

I'm currently at the crossroads and I'm supposed to make my first big life decision, because I have to decide, which university I would want attend in the future. 

And before you grab your pitchforks, I'm not going to compare the two universities, it's more about the circumstances surrounding them. 

Let me explain:

I can either go to a decorated uni in hometown, keep on living with my mother to cut living costs and being surrounded by my friends and family.

I could attend an equally good university in a major city of my country, possibly living on my own without knowing anyone, being forced to make new experiences and having to go out of my comfort zone.

I'm not looking for you to make a decision for me, I'm just looking for your intel and past experiences from people, that had been in a  similar situation as well. In the end it's my decision, but this is pretty overwhelming and it is difficult for me to think rationally. 

The first choice would arguably be the easier, cheaper and more comfortable decision. I would still have a stable support system at demand and wouldn't have to worry about much other than studying.

I don't know what to think of the second choice though. On the one hand, it is the big city life, the people from all over and frankly a wholly different experience from my hometown but on the other hand I used to have difficulties making friends and the thought of finding new friends from scratch and possibly failing is really giving me anxiety.

As of now I'm currently favoring the second decision but that honestly can change up to multiple times a day. I kind of feel lost.

I’ve been trying to get a job. And the whole website thing wasn’t getting results. So. I said. Fuck it. I’ll call random law firms and see if they’re hiring. Boy am I glad I did that. 

I called somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 firms in the area I’m looking to work and a few said No, that’s fine not everyone’s hiring. A few said to forward my resume to them via email and they’d review it. Then this one dude. I called this firm that was a single person. I asked. “Hello, I was wondering if you were hiring a paralegal” 

His response made my year. 

He said “I don’t need a paralegal at the moment, however I was thinking about adding a remote position to answer the phones. So I’ll give you a call back in a week or two and you can give me your offer of how much you’d like to make per hour and we can see if I can make it work.” He laid out the complete job and like what would be required and he said that like. In the event that I would be hired it would be completely work from home with a phone he gives me and from the way it seems, if I play my cards right I might get this job.

My dad (60-ish) and my mom (55) has been married for 30 years I'm not sure how it was in the past  but as i grow up and started understanding the things around me i started noticing the way my dad treats us as a family and its getting worse now.

First thing i noticed is how He never treats us the same way he treats other people or other people's kid. He jokes around with them and laugh with them but when it comes to us its all cold words and sh-t (sorry). He never showed affection towards me, never tried to get close to me and he feels more like a stranger.


Now that all my sibling are on their own its me and my parents living together and for the past few years he barely give us any money he works and spend the money on alcohol (he's alcoholic) my mom doesn't make much in her two jobs and i don't have one (coz covid), he doesn't buy food or anything for the house, doesnt even think about buying it unless its for himself.
Whenever my mom ask for anything from him he starts yelling and cursing us like we are the problem.
When there is something that need fixing in the house we have to tell him hundred times and he still won't fix it but if it was others he immediately goes and fix anything they need fixed.
I don't really talk with him because whenever i try i just end up crying, we speak like three words everyday and I'm fine with it.

Tbh, I kinda have issue with men because of him, like I'm scared to get to know a man and he turns to be like him which is why i rejected a few and I'm worried I'm gonna stay like this forever.

Everyone around us say we treat him harshly and stuff but they never really see what happens behind closed doors. My dad is so good at pretending to be the victim but he is really just a selfish human being who cares only about himself and his fb girlfriends (he cheats too) and I'm so tired of him.

However my boyfriends parents kinda already have that feeling as in their family there have been allot of marriages with Indians lol. And it’s basically been the same thing but worked out in the end. My boyfriends cousin wasn’t introduced to his gf until 5 years. Similarly this has happened with my family as well. 

My cousins have had allot of interracial relationships where they have only introduced them when everything is 100% good. Now it’s probably gonna be the same for me until I’m 25-27 or maybe a bit earlier as in our culture “ dating “ allot of guys isn’t seen as good and is not common. So I rather them just think I dated “one” guy and chose the right one. They don’t really know allot for other stuff I’ve done and do so i don’t wanna have them be too involved. Also that’s the age my bf and I are happy with. I do see my boyfriend in the future but I want to make sure that my bf and I are actually set, Also we had a fresh start as the first year of us dating was very immature especially from my side as it was my first serious relationship and we both lacked so much commitment and maturity. So we actually had a new fresh start and it’s officially been almost a year since and we are doing great but I guess it also took us both a whole ass year to be committed.

I wanna also make sure I have my life some what organised with my finances, degree graduation and a proper plan with my bf so my parents are confident with my decision. Of course i don’t need to have my life completely sorted but at least some start. That’s how it’s worked out with my close cousins as well. I also won’t be living with my parents by 25-27 as they know I wanna experience my own place after I graduate. 
My Aunty (dads sister) and cousins from India actually know about my relationship and told me to just focus on my self and relationship for now and once we are at the stage we are ready then tell them but said to not tell now. My boyfriend is also very understanding and said he already knew what he was getting himself into. Even though everyone seems to be understanding. I do know my parents will end up accepting him but definitely not now (also at that point i would still chose my bf first also in our family, once the guy is accepted then our families don’t really get involved anymore especially if it’s close to the marriage age).

I'm 21 female, still currently living at home with my parents. I'm currently getting out of a slump in life all around. After 2020 I realized way more immature than I thought. I had notions that if I didn't live at home things would be better- I could move in my own way, be more independent etc.   
After this year though I realize I don't really act for myself. I'm used to being in a best friend relationship- so in short I've been very co-dependent. Always having someone to go to to help me think, to come up with solutions or just tell me what to do. My previous best friends have always helped me get through hard times and we would help each other out with emotions and comforting..  


This year is different. I'm on my own- don't have someone super close like before. I noticed this whole year I've hid away and avoided things I know I should do to improve my situation- eg cleaning out extra stuff I don't need- to sell or donate. And resolving some issues that have been bugging me that I do have control over to change. Just a whole list of things I know I could do for myself but I just ""haven't gotten around to doing it"" or even picking up hobbies I've been saying I want to try out.   


Me and my parents have different opinions on things and this whole year I've been hung up on fighting them and refusing to do what they tell me and  I didn't get much done from the goals I set.   
I find myself now feeling the need to be right and to have the last word with my mom...   
I keep making other people's problems my problem and blaming them since I can't do ""what I want"".   
I realized I'm immature in my relationships too... I tend to overshare or just don't know what to do in new situations and I become reactive and impulsive...   


Yeah I realize I'm full of shit in a lot of ways and I'm inconsistent and unreliable a lot of time...   
I want to change though and actually become more mature, more independent :)

I was happy to wake up in the morning and looked forward to the day. Now I just look forward to being able to go to bed again at night. Every day blends in to the next and life seems so monotonous. I’m 20 now and that time wasn’t so long ago, maybe like 3-4 years. Don’t get me wrong, there are still some things I enjoy, I wouldn’t still be here if there weren’t, but there’s a lot less than before. 

Is this really what growing up is? Does everyone go through this? Did my parents go through this? All I see in my future is working a 9-5 job, retiring at 65 when I’m too old to do anything, and then dying. What do I have to look forward to in my life. Will I ever find true happiness, I don’t think so, I think very few people ever do. Why go through all this trouble if I never will? I know that people say to appreciate the small things in life, and I try to, but all of those small things being good doesn’t make up for the big things being bad. 

I want to be on my death bed and say to myself “I gave it my best shot, and I’ve got not regrets” but I know that that will never be true, because it isn’t even true now.  I know that some of the most successful people in life will probably have regrets, that everyone does. I know that people say to push past them, but I just can’t seem to be able to do that and I hold onto them. 

Now that i’m getting older, I realize that everything adults told me as a kid were true, I just wish I listened sooner.",youngadults,What happened?,0.0

As a result I can be kind of overly giving sometimes? My dad always said “we freely receive so we freely give” n that’s basically my approach.. I help as much as ppl are willing to let me. 

but it gets complicated bc I also never want to hurt peoples pride/feelings and I know my gf is sometimes self conscious about not having the same access to family funds that I do (whether I take full advantage or not). I love her and I hate to see her stressed/struggling but I also never want to make her feel small about needing help. I try to make it casual/offhanded whenever I help and say it’s not a big deal, but I also understand that that could make her feel even worse (“oh this bill that’s a huge deal for you? 2 finger taps and it’s gone!

This is referred to as an example of macroevolution, a species changing significantly, structurally, into another species over a long period of time.

          When it comes to the origin of humanity, there are even groups that believe that both the Biblical account of creation as well as macroevolution could both be accurate. Such as the group BioLogos who have an Evolutionary Creationist perspective, that natural selection and other evolutionary mechanisms, acting over long periods of time could result in significant bodily changes illustrating common ancestry between different species, and that God could have set this all in motion.1

          And sure if a human stood next to a gorilla today, there are similarities that can be noticed loosely, in basic body limb structure and some facial similarities, and the noticeably higher intellect of primates when compared to other animals, but are we just drawing common ancestry conclusions because it seems easy and straightforward?

We must ask ourselves, at its core, do we even *want* to be related to apes? What would that mean? What would that be saying about us, about humanity and our purpose?

In the Genesis creation account in the Bible, we are told that God creates man in His image. “Imago Dei” the Latin phrase meaning “image of God”.

*“Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image,* 

*in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea*

*and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals,*

*\[*[*a*](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+1&amp;version=NIV#fen-NIV-26a)*\] and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”*

*So God created mankind in his own image,*  
*in the image of God he created them;*  
*male and female he created them.” -*  **Genesis 1:26-27**

What does being made in God’s image mean? It means that we are set apart. God created the animals and then created man after that, and it is man that He created in His image, nothing else.

If we were made in the image of God, are we saying that God is an ape-like animal? Or at one point, was an ape-like creature? Would that seem silly? How then would we speak to the nature of humanity, our intellect, our spirituality, our morality, our rationality and consciousness, our need for purpose in life?

&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/4ig2cwnvsl561.gif

&amp;#x200B;

To be made in the image of God, it means we resemble God in substance. We have value, dignity and morals. We have unique relational abilities able to communicate and love, and we are able to represent God in what we do. Being made in the Image of God speaks to human exceptionalism, not simply descending from ape common ancestry.

And this can be supported further by the archaeological and fossil records, as well as molecular anthropological findings.

Humans, as we are now, suddenly appeared on Earth 100,000-150,000 years ago. There is no evolutionary evidence showing earlier Hominds (ape-like creatures) or Neanderthals evolving into the modern humans we have today. These creatures went extinct, and then there was a sudden appearance of modern humans. This is also indicated by the sudden appearances of art and symbolism, the “Sociocultural big bang”, signs of creativity and intellect that didn’t exist in the same way prior, but appeared at the same time modern humans did.

It is also critical to note that Neanderthals, though they were on Earth longer than modern humans were, their technological creations remained static, there was no advancement. While modern humans started out with archaic tools and have since made numerous technological advancements within less time.

The fossil record also indicates that Human brains are different from Neanderthal brains, noticeably from the skull shapes, confirming that we are in fact distinct. The human brain actually has an expanded parietal lobe and the area of the brain required for vision was much larger in the brains of Neanderthals than in the human brain. This actually would diminish the capacity for cognitive thought for Neanderthals.

So when we suddenly appeared on the Earth 100,000-150,000 years ago, we were already designed to be exceptional.

In fact, had I gone back this semester, I would have started the school year at age 17. I'm just clarifying that because... well, I'm not exactly sure. I'm insecure about going back, I guess.

The reason for my return is that I dropped out as a sophomore---well I KIND of dropped out---I stopped taking all the classes I hated, and instead only took courses I was interested in; which resulted in completing every single social studies and English course, and an accumulative TWO math and science classes. I left the school with the rest of my graduating class, only without a diploma.

But my old counsellor reached out and proposed I get all my credits this coming semester, and being so hopelessly directionless... I've accepted. I'll be doing it all ONLINE, by the way.

Now I'm just... trying to come to terms with this. It's very strange for me.

My name is Michael Levy and I am a doctoral student at New York University. For my dissertation under the advisement of Dr. Anil Chacko, I am conducting a paid qualitative research study examining the effects of stimulant use on non-White young adults (18-24) with ADHD who have histories of stimulant use who were diagnosed in childhood. This study can be completed in person or via skype. Those interested in participating can complete the [screener](https://nyu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_d54FFAjmm9VxEKp) (should take about 5 minutes). Please email me if you have any questions!

Thank you in advance!

I’ve only had one job, which was a summer internship where I didn’t do anything important and actually had a good amount of free time, so it wasn’t stressful at all. It payed decent too. The people were alright, most of them were way older than me though so I couldn’t relate to them too well. Plus, it was *so* nice being able to come home and not worry about anything, and just have the night to myself. No reports to start, no tests to study for, as soon as I got home, I could eat dinner, play video games, and just do whatever the fuck I wanted because work didn’t follow me home. 

But then again, I *love* learning. I didn’t learn that much at my internship, so it almost felt pointless. At school, I love almost always having some kind of task I need to complete. It gets hard to deal with the stress at times, but the payoff of getting a good grade on a test or finally figuring out how to do that one problem is worth it, imo. I feel this way especially now that I’m in college and I’m surrounded by people who also care about their studies. Plus, school can be a great place to socialize and make friends.

So i had this idea- imagine a program where you are given a bunch of ingredients and some tools, and using those you can create potions. However, you aren't actually told any recipes and the results of your potions are dependent upon many intertwined variables that you are never explicitly shown. You have to experiment and research potion making as if you were a real alchemist in order to discover new potions and perfect their stats.

Well i made a prototype of that. It currently only has two ingredients (honey and water) and only one type of potion possible. A part of my idea is I also want to get people together in a discord server and have them form their own alchemy guilds. That way they can share tips among their guilds while keeping their research secret from the other guilds. The guilds could try competing to see which one can create the very best potions.

Anyways if this sounds like fun to you, come join my discord server: [https://discord.gg/59B965](https://discord.gg/59B965)

So, I wrote this letter to my professor: https://imgur.com/a/4b01sr5 

We sat down on some chairs and he read the letter. He got quiet and said, “Aw, that’s really sweet”. He laughed when he read the part about people not liking his jokes. It made me laugh too. After he got done reading it, he said that he was sorry for everything I’ve been through and he wants me to check in with him often. We then talked about religion, since I’ve been having a spiritual crisis. We prayed together, he prayed for me and gave me a card for his church. He told me to please not kill myself, and he said the cliche stuff about suicide, how there will be better days, and all that. I appreciated it. He smiled at me a lot during class, he told me he loves when I’m class because I always have the biggest smile on my face whenever he jokes around, and it’s true. We watched a video about rock n roll from England, and I made him laugh really hard when he wanted us to say one thing we learned, and I said, “All of the British bands seemed like pedophiles!”. He laughed so hard, and a few other people in class laughed too. He then elaborated, he knew what I meant, since a lot of the British bands like The Rolling Stones, catered to younger teenage girls. That’s what I got from the video we watched, anyway. 

I also saw my friend I met Saturday in person, who’s also in that class. After class, we stood out in the hallway and talked for a minute. We laughed, we told eachother our favorite songs from each others playlists we sent to one another. I decided to be friends with this guy after finding out he had the same music taste as me last week. I told him “thank you for talking to me, it means a lot that somebody wants to talk to me too” and he smiled and said “you’re welcome, it’s no problem”, or something to that effect. It made me feel happy inside. He’s a cool guy and I’m happy I feel the want to be friends and stay friends, to get to know him more.

If you have other ideas what I should analyze based on the collected data, comment please. There ist so much I could generate if I get enough answers. So I would be pretty lucky if you would answer it and share it with your friends. Now I just want to say thank you for your time. The survey is a google forms survey and fully anonymous. It runs 3 days from today and I’ll share the analysis here for sure.

Thank you!

There's this family tradition of leaving some things back at the vacation house every year so we can go back and feel nostalgic about those things, and I've always left the gameboy and come back every year to find it waiting there for me to play. That is, until I was in middle school, when she first took it. 

I thought I had misplaced it at first, and I tried to get it out of my mind by buying tons of other games and using various platforms so I wouldn't just be stuck on the advance, but I haven't forgotten about it since then.

So beginning of high school, I decided to buy another advance with the same game, and put it in my second hiding place after I left the vacation house. Well, I come back the next year, and it's gone, so I give up.

Now that I'm in university I'm thinking about buying another because I really want to play it with my boyfriend and for the nostalgia. This time, I'm not leaving it any hiding spots and I'm going to take it back to my dorm.

It's just I know now that my aunt has been stealing the gameboy advance all these years. I have no idea what she did to the first, but I went to her room to use the bathroom that year of my second gameboy and saw the cartridge on the sink. I didn't take it bc she was in the room, but now I know where my gameboy advances have been disappearing to over the years.

There's this N64 that my cousins and I used to play on all the time that's sort of become the 'family N64,' except now only me and my oldest cousin play on it whenever we go back to the vacation house. It originally belonged to my aunt though, but it really isn't hers anymore. 

I'm thinking about just taking it and sneaking it into my luggage whenever she's not around and only bringing it back to the house temporarily, same with the new gameboy advance I'm about to get.

I'm really frustrated and this will be the last year my gameboy advance goes missing. I have been having this problem since middle school, but no more.",youngadults,My aunt keeps stealing my gameboy advance. I'm thinking about bringing the N64 back to my dorm.,0.0

i go to his Instagram and see a close friend story that says something like ""i removed all the people on close friends except the one i like"". i tell him wtf and then uploads another story where it basically says it was just a joke. he tells me i always make things about me, and that he uploaded that so his crush could see it lol.

im not heartbroken because I could see some red flags, like when he told me that time he dated someone even though he wasnt interested, just because he was bored and it was something to do.

i guess im just sad people like that exists. but damn, he ended up being a pretty toxic guy. i left some stuff because this post is already long enough but ive never been closer to tell someone to go see a psychologist.

Idk if it’s cause of envy or cause of a feeling of inferiority (I’ve always had a “inferiority complex” in my 22 years). Also when I fail tests and exams but see my peers succeed I also get upset.

I think the root of the problem is my obsession with comparing myself to others but i’m not too sure. Any thoughts on how to go about handling this?",youngadults,How to get out of “others should fail” mentality?,0.0

I actually feel quite depressed and it still makes me want to cry.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I have started to learn about politics when I was 9 years old when my parents brought me to my first protest on 1st July, 2012. At that time, a new chief executive was ""elected"" against Hong Kong residents' will and a lot of us protested to make him step down. Of course he didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

One of the most remarkable movements was the Umbrella movement in 2014. It started on my 12th birthday and I immediately joined the strike the next day. We hoped for true universal suffrage. Of course, it is not granted. The movement faded and I started despise talking about politics after arguing with a friend the next year. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

It is totally unexpected for me that a large movement broke out towards the last year of my secondary life. I thought Hong Kong was going to face the fate of being a literal part of China, and people would not wake up. I am genuinely grateful that more and more people started to realize what the CCP actually wants and decided to voice out. It's not just among the local people, but internationally, that know the fact that ""Hong Kong is not China."" Facing large amount of protestors, the government decided to continue being arrogant and even started to push boundaries. This is when I know I support Hong Kong Independence. Though, I might leave this place and head to another country for a fresh start. I feel like a traitor, but I don't have another choice, and it makes me feel super guilty.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

My 18th birthday is soon approaching and I feel like I have gotten quite many unforgettable experiences regarding social movements. I will never forget the time when I was standing amongst the crowd to sing in 2014, and the time I was leading a group of secondary students to protest on the street a few months ago. I hope things will turn better and I can live to see the day when CCP collapses.",youngadults,Just wanna share some feelings being a Hong Konger..,0.0

As a young person myself, taking to my friends about how I like to spend my free time naked, they all seem pretty disinterested at best. Some having a history of sexual abuse, I can totally understand why they wouldn't be down even though nudism is a totally non sexual thing (in my view. Some swingers call themselves Nudists, which I disagree with, that's a different argument). 

In case you arent familiar, here are some of the benefits and a rundown. 

Nudists are just normal folks who like doing normal things, and hanging out naked. There are beaches, parks, clubs and other places around the world dedicated to nude recreation. 

I'm not saying nudism would cure the 'rona, but sunlight and vitamin D are a really healthy. 

While I am not an owner of breasts, I have heard health benefits to going braless. I have no authority to speak on these claims other than what I read. 

It also does wonders for body positivity. Youd think this would have the opposite effect, but people go to nude beaches to *be* naked, not to *see* naked people. 

And incase I havent emphasizes, this is a naked thing, not a sex thing.

I dont *really* buy these reasons. 

As a young person myself, taking to my friends about how I like to spend my free time naked, they all seem pretty disinterested at best. Some having a history of sexual abuse, I can totally understand why they wouldn't be down even though nudism is a totally non sexual thing (in my view. Some swingers call themselves Nudists, which I disagree with, that's a different argument). 

In case you arent familiar, here are some of the benefits and a rundown. 

Nudists are just normal folks who like doing normal things, and hanging out naked. There are beaches, parks, clubs and other places around the world dedicated to nude recreation. 

I'm not saying nudism would cure the 'rona, but sunlight and vitamin D are a really healthy",youngadults,Have you ever considered trying nudism?,0.0

While I enjoyed my freshman year, it was a little limited due to my parent’s refusal to establish boundaries. They monitor my bank account, they track my location, and they get furious if they find out I’m doing any drinking or drugs.

Now, I could handle all of that when I was in high school. It was kind of fun sneaking around and trying to come up with creative ways to get around their rules, and I think it helped me develop into a more complete person with a better idea of what I deem important (I’m far from a “grown up”, but I know what I value in life and I know it’s different than what they value). But, as a young adult, especially as a young adult entering his second year of adulthood, I’m sick of it.

So, I thought of a way to partially mitigate the problem, but I have no real idea if executing it would be a good idea. Essentially, my plan is create my own bank account independent from theirs, slowly transfer all my money over in ways they won’t recognize (cash back on groceries, telling them I’m spending cash when I’m really not, that kind of thing), and then once I’m done fully transferring all of my paychecks and any other income to the new account.

I feel bad being so deceptive, but every time I try to approach the issue with them they fly off the handle and call me immature and irresponsible. I get it, no parent wants their kids to be drinking or smoking pot, but I don’t really drink and I’ve been safely and responsibly enjoying pot since I was like 15. I’ve had a job since I was 16 (not currently due to corona but I still have the position) and I have a full-ride merit based scholarship to a top 5 public university. I’ll admit that I’m a fuck up, like most teenagers, but I’d like to think I’m more responsible than they give me credit for. 

Anyways, I don’t know much about the logistics of setting up a new bank account, although I can’t imagine it’s nearly as risky as, say, signing up for a credit card without consulting them. As long as I don’t overdraw then I can’t see how I could go into debt or anything. Any advice or feedback would be helpful, thanks in advance.

Things are eh, and I’ve started to feel a little...resentment towards her. 

Let me explain.

I’ve actually been doing this since I graduated high school. I grew up very close to her, and feel this obligation to help her in whatever way I can. I didn’t move out of my hometown because I wanted to be with her til the very end. And she helps me out too by offering money sometimes and letting me live rent free, which I really appreciate. And I even committed myself to not permanently/temporarily moving out of town because I know she’d be lonely. She seems like her angel...But only recently am I starting to feel like she’s starting to suck the life force out of me. Although she’s very fragile and very caring as a Latina grandma, she’s 84 and it’s frustrating. She makes me anxious at times, consistently complains at me for not eating enough and frequently asks for help. I feel she annoys me easily because she talks to me like she’s my mom, and I tell her to please respect when I can’t accept an offer but she still pushes me. 
And in the past, she’d call me while doing things for myself (with gf/friends/or having to myself) to help with small things, like bring in her laundry, picking up groceries or going to the ATM for her. Once, she’s called asking me to come like she was entitled to my time, which angered me (she doesn’t do that now). And although I love her and she says she feels bad for asking for my attention a lot, I feel I made the wrong choice to move here. I think I walked into a caretaker role, whether or not I like it. And I have the means to move on my own, I just don’t know if I’m an asshole for wanting to bounce already.

I’m also just starting to get serious about my career and studying for the CPA exams, but I feel distracted knowing she needs my help. It makes me anxious and breaks my study routine. I even move my books and laptop to study in the living room with her but it’s hard to focus with her Tv on. 

And what makes me sad is that I will have to do this for my own parents when they’re split. My moms side isn’t close to my abuela. And my dad and uncle (her sons) are just not there enough for her emotionally. Dad is too impatient and is a workaholic and my uncle moved out of country years ago and cares only for himself. So I feel responsible for being here. And I feel anchored because my grandma constantly says she’d ra her have me here over them. 

TL;DR: live with grandma, rest of family isn’t doing enough for her. been her help we since college and now second guessing living with her, I’m gettin depressed and feel like I’m missing out on some youth and privacy. Nearing 30s.

I'm going into Senior year of college (with a humanities major that's tiny, and I don't know what I even learned in college tbh...) and this is the first time I'm looking around myself and feeling old. 

There are famous pop singers and YouTube vloggers who are younger than me, yet due to their accomplishments, it feels as though they're older than me. I've dated two guys (as a Sophomore in college) and that's it. After this year, all the high schoolers in my local high school will be people I didn't go to school with. I can't drive because I just never got the opportunity to take the test (with all the kerfluffles in college and my personal life). And I'm feeling adulthood coming on rapidly even though I still see myself as a kid.

All the things I thought about when it came to being young, parties, getting drunk, falling madly in love, etc... Kind of happened, but it felt very anti-climactic. And my anxiety disorder and personal histories of trauma also prevented me from living my college days to my fullest. I have one close friend and a friend group from my Church. I've been in love and gotten my heart broken by an ex. I got a tattoo at 18 that I kinda regret now. The rites of passage we think about with youth kind of happened, but I guess I expected something more remarkable...

I think that when you're a ""kid"" (in the loose sense of the word), it's really a part of your identity. People give you free passes to be stupid, they enthuse about your future, you have coming of age stuff like getting your license or graduating high school, tons of occasions where people pay attention to you, and you feel special. (I'm American and we're big on the ""cult of youth"".) So when you feel that slipping away, it's a huge deal. 

I can still remember high school graduation like it was yesterday. As a child and teenager, it felt like college was the end. I didn't even think about not being a student, about being an ""adult"". Now it's almost here for me, and I'm quarantined up in my parents' house. And I'm wondering how I'm supposed to enjoy my youth like this.

Also, does anyone else on here hate being told ""you're at your peak, it's all downhill from here :\^D""? I hope that my life gets more exciting and fulfilling than what I've had in the past...",youngadults,21/f and having a quarter-life crisis,0.0

Rent is $475, which includes Water, Sewer, and Trash. As for the tenant, they will take care of electricity, wifi, &amp; TV. It has been newly renovated with new A/C, new floors, windows, countertop, and cabinets. But now the con is that is has no washer/dryer nor hookup for washer/dryer. All other appliances, however, are included. 

That is the only con I have for the apartment is no washer/dryer. I'm the type of guy who prefers to wash his clothes at the end/start of every week. Since there is no such machine to take care of that chore come my question: Is there any other way for one to do their laundry? If so what are the different types. 

Ive been doing my own research and so far all I keep seeing are Landry services where you give someone your clothes they wash and you pay them, most services, per pound of clothes. I haven't yet seen any other methods of doing laundry.

I'm mostly self sufficient, my parents help me with college and bills, but I'm just as good if not better at supporting myself as most others in my position. Problem is, whenever I come home, my parents are extremely controlling. I'm not a fan of anyone having authority over me, but my parents certainly think they do. I try to be very nice to them, but they still treat me like a child and expect me to treat them like I'm a child, despite the fact that I'm very much an adult. Whenever I bring this up, they get mad, say I'm being 'disrespectful', and say since they help me with phone bills and college expenses that they can treat me that way. They recently decided to suspend my cellphone service saying I've been rude and that they can suspend it any time they want since they are the ones paying my bills.

I'm a little confused, because I expect them to treat me as a fellow adult, not a child. This is also extremely frustrating to me since it's undermining my own authority of myself.

So in light of the current situation, I decided to host a hella huge discord party with my IRL friends and you rando's from the Internet!

The plan is to all chill and wait for a lot of people to arrive, then we'll play some huge multiplayer games Like Gmod, Minecraft, Jackbox, etc. Maybe we'll do a sync-vid session or two. Possibly raid a couple 1 viewer streamers to watch them freak out, it'll be a good time!

Obviously we expect people to act mature. No racist/homophobic/sexist/yadada behavior will NOT be tolerated. I will have discord admins set. If someone is causing issues please feel free to DM one of us. people of all ages will be hanging out so be respectful. This is a time to hang out, make some friends, and make the most of this quarantine bs. I hope to see a lot of you there and I'm super excited. Here's the info:

**Platform:** *Discord (No mic required, we'll have several chat rooms if people eventually want to split off)*

**Date:** *May 28th (No time set, I plan to be there all day, but festivities will probably start around lunch time!)*

Hey everyone! I want to tell you a little background info about myself and why I have decided to move out. I am 20 years old and just finished a medical program at a trade school. I was previously going to a community college as a science transfer, but took sometime off because I felt really lost. So now I will be transferring to a school in Georgia to study Biology. 

The reasons I am moving out:
1) my parents refuse to pay for my school even when I was doing something they wanted me to study
2) my parents expect me to clean the whole house and be home at the time they request
3) I am not paid for my chores and not appreciated (I used to get an allowance)
4) they complain about having to drive me places but refuse to help me get a car (they bought new cars for themselves)
5) they spend more money on wants than things I need like food and school stuff
6) they fight constantly and are loud especially now during quarantine 
7) they’re very abusive towards me, not physical anymore, but verbally. I suffer from anxiety and OCD and they know this! But they continue to yell at me and tell me to get over things. 

It is at the point where my boyfriend is offering to give me money for food. I have a job but I’m saving for a car and have finally saved enough. He’s just really concerned about my mental health and has really taken care of me.",youngadults,Moving Out :),0.0

And I was feeling like she just wanted a ""text buddy"". I asked her exactly that in a indirect way. And she confirmed that. She said that she would tell me, if she was interested in something more.
So I slowed down in texting with her. Gave shorter answers and occassionally askedquestions back.
We stop writing for two weeks.

I normally dont have my face as a profile picture, but a friend of mine shot a good picture, so I changed my profile picture. Means she saw my face.

She wrote me again. Wrote something like, if you ever need help with any subject in uni, just ask me. Nothing flirty, just friendly. Thats what I would guess.

We wrote again for 1-2 days. She was writing with hearts and stuff. But I wouldnt still consider it as flirting. Many girls write like that, right?

I find a good song, that I knew she would like. So I sent her a Youtube Link. She writed me back immediatly, that she was just hearing this song, in this moment. We write again for one day.

2 days before today, someone made a meme on the student platform. There was a picture of someone who was grinning and the poster wrote over that: When you have the number of your crush and could send him a Hi. 
Another User wrote under the post jokingly: Hey, [girls name, that I write with] is that you?
Sure it could just be another girl that has that exact spelling of her name. But her name isnt that common.

I dont know if she likes me or not. She seems to have a  good personality. And if she would ask me, I would go to a date with her.
Should I write her back or just wait and see what happens?",youngadults,Does this girl like me?,0.0

I am working on a project studying how people interpret emotions in text conversations.

The question I am trying to answer is ""Given a written statement or conversation, will different people interpret the statement in the same way?""  


This is a preliminary survey intended to test the validity of this question. I would really appreciate it if you guys would be willing to fill it out.  


Also, if you have any constructive criticism about the survey, please let me know.  
 Thank you!

I am 18 and I bought a car that I was going to pick up today. I asked a friend if he could drive me there, but he didn't have a car so I asked if we could use my parents car. Which we could. Now everyone thought that he had his driver's license for months but he said he hasn't driven in quite a while sk he wouldn't be that great. No problem I thought. If you get the feel of it again you be just fine. The first few kilometers were a bit Rusty but that is understandable after not having driven in so long and that car isn't the easiest to drive in. Now he thinks he got the feeling so he starts driving faster. Straight road no cars. Be for some idiotic reason he just turns right far too fast almost against a concrete block and then full speed of a dyke into the water!! I get all three of us out. No one got hurt. Someone called the police and an ambulance. He told the cops he had his driver's license stolen but that he did have it. The police checks the computer and come and tell me that he never got a license for anything. Ever. Now my parents car is total loss and the one behind the wheel doesn't have a license...

Hi, so in the fall of 2019, I (20f) was leaving for Americorps NCCC, which is like the Peacecorps but domestic. Anyway, while I was gone, my parents split up which isn’t a new occurrence. They’ve been legally divorced since I was 5 and have been on and off again ever since. My dad moved out and it looks like it’s for good this time. 

Now it’s just my younger sisters (17) and my mom. My sisters pretty much go unsupervised because my parents kind of let them do whatever they want. When I was at home, I would pick them up from school and take them to work, I would buy dinner because no one cooks, I would go pick up their phones from school if they got them taken away, that kind of thing. 

My parents got confident in the girls being in good hands if they were with me and stopped trying. They also deal with personal things, like we all do, but got lazy. While my sisters are almost out of the house, they still need guidance. My mom comes home, drinks, and goes to sleep. My dad would come home, and scroll through Facebook on his computer. Whenever we try to call either of them out on anything, nothing ever changes. Both of my parents are alcoholics and my mom always thinks we’re trying to attack her and it always just ends up in a screaming match.

When I was home over Christmas break, I got a call from my sister (we’ll call her Callie) to go pick up my other sister (we’ll call her Brenda). Callie told me that Brenda refused to let Callie take her home so they called me. 

I get to the restaurant that Brenda works at and one of her coworkers comes out to tell me that Brenda was taking shots after work with the other employees and that she tried to fight Callie and her boyfriend and hit both of them. (Just reminding you that my sisters are 17 and her coworkers are all above 21). 

After we finally convince Brenda to get in the car with me to go home, I’m not sure whether to take her home because she is noticeably drunk and I don’t want her to get in trouble with my parents, which lol jokes on me because there were no consequences. I decide to drive around with her hoping she sobers up. In her drunken rampage, she starts ranting to me and tells me that I don’t care about them because I’m in California and no one cares about them and that she and my other sister are going to stay in our hometown and end up with boyfriends that beat them and they’re going to end up like my parents and a bunch of other f****d up s**t. 

I’m bawling listening to her and finally decide to drive her home because I can’t take it anymore. She didn’t even get in trouble, like I said, my sisters are pretty much free to do whatever they want. Brenda even yelled at my mom and called her out on not being there, they have a yelling match but in the end, nothing is done. As usual. My mom also doesn’t always treat my sisters equally. She chooses to pick on Callie and Brenda, who needs the attention and guidance, usually goes under the radar.

My life got so much better once I left my hometown. Now, I feel as though every time I come back, something goes wrong and I usually feel depressed when I’m here. However, I carry a lot of anxiety about my sisters because they are just allowed to be anywhere at any time. I’m confident in my sister Callie’s ability to take care of herself. She’s been doing it for a while. 

My other sister, Brenda, is making some questionable decisions and hanging out with older people that don’t have jobs and have nothing better to do but drink. I have a hard time communicating with my family and friends even if I want them in my life because I’ve always struggled with depression. I don’t want them to think I don’t care about them but I would prefer to keep distance from my mother and my hometown.

Edit: The reason my parents split up is because my mom cheated on my dad and kicked him out. She now brings her boyfriend into the house that my dad built and the place my sisters call home without consulting anyone. Now my sisters can’t even go home without there being some stranger there that my mom hasn’t introduced anyone to. She has also been super toxic to my dad, who she’s shared almost 20 years and 3 children with. Makes me wonder what she would do to literally anyone else.

I appreciate any advice you can give.",youngadults,Worried about my 17 year old sisters who are basically unsupervised because my mom has given up on being a mother/ toxic family members,0.0

So as with the title yes I have may have suspicious activity in my house with my family. Here's what I have so far and I'm trying to debunk this ""suspicious activity"".

So it all started with my little brother of 6. Two days ago he had peed on the couch in the living room where he slept the night and that never happens. Of course he got in trouble. The living room is connected to some (up)stairs, the kitchen with no door, and three rooms (1 bathroom &amp; 2 Bedrooms). One bed room also doesn't have a door. The kitchen has a door that leads to another room behind the kitchen. Tonight before I had gone to bed (my family and I were all gathered in my parents bedroom laughing) my little brother said he had heard the door in the kitchen open. 

Now here's the thing, I had said that the living room is connected to the kitchen with no door, but the kitchen is connected to another room with a door. In that other room we only keep a dog in there.(I forgot we also have a cat too).  It also has a private bathroom. For one of my family members to use the bathroom they would use bathroom already connected to the living room which is closer. After hearing this I had the realization that what if my little brother peed the couch because he had heard the door open? 

Of course, as stated before, he had peed the couch 2 days ago and he had heard the door open at night last night. Maybe he didn't pee last night when the door opened because he got in trouble. Also, I think maybe 2 nights ago or last night, my little brother had asked for him to sleep with me. I told him no (not knowing) but that I would stay with him until he fell asleep. 

Might also add that we have crazy neighbors too. The dude gets at like 2 or 3 am and either goes or come back in his truck and it makes A LOT of noise. Sometimes hell also just turn the truck on for no reason, go nowhere, and then turn it off and go back in. Other times, they'll take their dog out, same hours too 2 or 3 am, and then later be yelling GET IN!! or NOW!! two or three times. Maybe my little brother got scared from my neighbors slamming the door, oftentimes,  but then how does that make him think the door in the kitchen open and got him scared? 

Right now I'm staying up to see if I can hear any noise or possibly see and my other littler brother of 15 is also helping me( he chose to do so). If you got any kind of idea possibility of what MiGhTVE happened please comment because I'm trying to debunk. To be honest My mind keeps going to paranormal shit but I am refraining from that idea and using logic for the moment because my family and I do have a bad history of paranormal stuff happen in our last house but that's for a different time.",youngadults,Suspicious Activity in my house.?

About an hour ago)* The redditor recently found out they couldn't get a job because of a situation way out of their control and my basic response was **""Keep looking, something better will come along!""**

That post really got me thinking of times when I've missed out on opportunities only to either turn it into a positive or for something else more grand to come along and the thing is, I really can't think of a time when I've done this? I have lost out on opportunities but when I do, I just take the blow and keep trucking on really. I've never been rejected from a dream job to get a job that is 10× better and pays twice the amount of my dream job. I've never been rejected by a girl just to get asked out by a supermodel. Yet, I advised that previous redditor and gave them encouragement as if I'm the wise one with the experience? I'm not - it's just what I am told all the time (and I tell myself it too). I'm 100% sure that it will all work out for that previous redditor but it felt like i was feeding false hope and giving good advice at the same time? 

Examples of opportunities I've lost out on is simply not getting a job I wanted. Or, not being able to make a trip because I couldn't get time off work. Like I said, I just roll with the punches and move on then either keep trying or go for something else. I just create my own opportunities. 

So, has there been a time when you've lost out on an opportunity and something else better has come along? What happened? Was it related to a career or someone you fancied? A friendship? A big move in life? 

And most of all, do I make sense here? I might come back and reword it to make it easier to read.

Original post:

He had to wear a neck brace for months after that . And it hurt like hell for him to talk. By the time his neck healed, The bone was fine but the nerves didn’t heal right. Every time he tried to speak it caused him extreme pain. His doctor said, That might heal on its own with time, But they couldn’t do anything for him. So Emmett had to learn to sign, We all kind of learned a bit to help him . I know a bastardized version of it And enough to understand what he was saying. But not being able to speak made playing QB impossible for him.

Anyway I got a call today, from Emmett’s number . He woke up about a month ago with a lot less pain in his throat , and he has been doing Speech therapy for a two weeks now and he has started talking again. He sounds like an 80-year-old chainsmoker but damn does he sound happy. Emmett can talk again without feeling like he is being punched in the throat ... so hell yeah! He can talk on the phone again and speak to other people That don’t know ASL. According to him his mom cried When she heard him speak again.

Update:

I talked to Emmett about five minutes ago. He no longer sounds like He’s been smoking 2 packs a day Since he was five. But he could probably give Morgan Freeman a run for his money deep voice wise. He has a girlfriend now, which is freaking awesome. He used to have a hell of a time Communicating with anyone who wasn’t in our group of friends That didn’t know at least a bit of sign language. Since it hurt like hell for him to speak. Emmett is doing alright. And he says he is in For going an rowing the Potomac with our old crew in honor of Caleb Once the pandemic passes.

Edit:
TLDR: long night of drinking ended with a broken up relationship and someone taking my gun out of my car. Gun was found in the oven. 



Well, the night started at about 7 and started out fine. It was a mixture of my 2 friend groups and I finally got them all to meet. We all took a shot to start, and I got half of a cup, chugged it, and didnt drink anymore the rest of the night. Enough to have a good time, but not too much to be able to make sure nobody did anything stupid. 

Everything is going fine. About midnight rolls around and the 5 people that came in one car decided to leave. One of them stayed sober and didnt drink because he was driving them all home, so, works out great. I let them leave, they text me 30 minutes later telling me they made it home. 

So 2 girls, (we'll call them Ashley and Cait) started getting a bit touchy, but Ashley's boyfriend is also at the party. (We'll call him mike). 

Ashley starts getting her hands all over Cait and is getting more and more drunk, I decided to cut her off after that. But it didn't stop what happened unfortunately. 
She starts taking Caits shirt up and gives her a hickey on Caits boob.
Obviously, mike (knowing Ashley is bi) isnt happy anymore. 

Mike is mad but doesnt do anything to her, they keep partying and I told them they need to start taking things easy as it's already 2 am. 

The next events took place in 1 hour and 15 minutes. 

1 more person leaves, we are down to 5 of us. Me, Cait, ashley, mike, and a friend from work (we'll call him bobby). 

Mike and ashley blow up into a raging arguement, mike steps towards her and starts screaming, so I push her into the door way behind her and shut the door and lock the 2 of us in there. Effectively ending the arguement. I try to calm her down, it works a little bit but not enough. Mike calms down enough that he decides he needs to leave. The last time he had a drink was 5 hours ago at this point, so I'm sure the adrenaline has helped lean off the last bit of the alcohol he was feeling. He insists on leaving. He grabs all of his shit from the apartment and starts loading it into his car.

 I take ashley into the bathroom and start to calm her down.
Once he grabs the last of his stuff, I take him outside. Make sure he is good and reluctantly allow him to leave with the condition that he stay on the phone with me in my ear buds. I simply muted my end so he couldn't hear anything going on. 

Thought that was the end? Nah, this is where shit hits the fan.

I carry a gun in my state. But when I go to parties, I lock it in my car under the driver seat. I went out to my car and go to grab my phone charger and notice my gun isnt there. MY GUN IS MISSING....MY GUN..
I have managed to stay a maintained calm all night, but this finally gets me. I'm freaking out now. 

The only person that has a track record of taking keys and losing them is ashley, the only other 2 people, Cait and bobby, I've know for quite some time and know for a fact they would never do it. I immediately know ashley took my gun and hid it, thinking it was safer. 

She is now plastered at this point. Cait is crying her eyes out because she played part in breaking them up, and bobby is on the floor puking into a cooler.  I'm not worried about them. I find my car keys in her room on the dresser. 
Its confirmed, she took my keys and hid it my gun from the car because I left my keys on the hook on the door. She begs that it wasnt her, but I'm not worried about playing blame game. I know she took it. I'll deal with her later. It is now a matter of finding it. She is mad and says that I dont need my gun after drinking. I tell her I dont need it, I just need to know WHERE it is and we can all go to sleep. She insists she doesnt have it, even tho she is saying she wont give it to me. So I inform her how serious the situation is. A missing firearm means I have to call the police for a stolen or missing firearm. 
Which means we would all be questioned about it at the police station. And knowing she did it, it was a subliminal message that if I didnt get my gun, I was going to press charges. 
So I start scouting the apartment. Nobody helps me look. I'm devouring this place looking for my gun. I looked for 30 minutes last night. 

Wanna know where I found it? In the fucking oven. This bitch hid my gun in an oven..... A FUCKING OVEN...so now that the major hurdle is gone, I make sure  everyone goes to bed. Ashley refuses to sleep or claim she took the gun. 

At the time I'm posting this, it's the morning after and I'm about to go into her room and fill her in on everything that happened and explain why I am not going to be her roomate in 2 months and that I'm not going to babysit her anymore when she drinks, nor will I invite her to drink. Hell I dont know If i even want to be friends with her at this point.

I violated my purpose and erradicated any opportunities I required to develop into a thorough and kind young adult. I became a thieiving felon thug by stealing property out of cars one night at 19, and I am almost 21 now. It's almost two years since I threw my life away, and prior to my 2 year anniversary I plan on committing suicide. 

I was given felony convictions and house arrest, along with some probation. I have done thinking on the matter and have determined that I am ineligible to continue this life. I deserved everything the world had to offer at 18, however I've determined that due to my immoral, dangerous and erratic choices made that horrific night at 19 that I no longer deserve the privilege of breathing air. I sentence myself to death as this life is not worthwhile any longer. I am a danger to myself and others, and require the discontinuation of this life in an effort to protect society and myself.

I wish I knew why I bothered continuously wasting everybodys time by posting about my planned suicide, but I'm trying to do everything I can to prolong my suicide until I'm approved for the activity time allowed by court. They will allow a BRIEF window each month to perform an outdoor activity, such as going to a friend's house (I don't have any,) and going hiking. I plan on going into the woods when approved and committing suicide with an undisclosed method. 

Once I die, I hope I can rest easy without feeling tormented. I don't deserve to exist because that belongs to non felon, non thieving normal people only who take advantage of the life we are privileged to experience. It's over. I am excited for all of the pain, suffering, bleeding and trauma I will feel during the long, grueling suicide process I deserve to go through. I pray all of my victims move on and feel peace. I recall one victim calling me a ""menace to society,"" and he's absolutely correct! Suicide WILL make him feel better. The menace died! Now he can rest easy knowing the menace who stole his car ended it all.

I want people to tell me I'm right. I don't want anymore people wasting their breath perpetuating the idea that people change, that I can be ""rehabilitated,"" or otherwise allowed a life worth living. I don't want to hear any more of this bullshit that it can improve, it can't. I'm broken. I needed to die a very long time ago, and I'm now a full, grown failure and I made my problems into the problems of those around me. I will post my final suicide update moments before I do it, maybe I'll upload a goodbye video.

 I don't have any friends so nobody is gonna give a fuck anyway. And why would the community give a damn? Some bummy, eeyeore, bitching felon blew his brains out because he didn't wanna suffer the consequences of his actions, boo fucking hoo. Goodbye, retard. And good riddance. Anyway why am I wasting anyone's time I'm not a fucking kid anymore. I'm gonna go end it when this lockdown is lifted, because then my request to go hiking is approved, and my suicide is completed.

I went into college as an Environmental Science major taking Bio 1 first semester and planning to take chemistry sophomore year. I ended up not doing well in Bio 1 and dropped it in November so it wouldn’t hurt my GPA but i finished the lab. I feel like if i really tried at the end of the semester i might have been able to get better than a C- but i can’t change that now. Since i wanted to be a bio major all throughout high school i don’t want to give up on it so easily. However, dropping it has definitely effected my passion and confidence in the biology field. I am currently taking a psychology course and a stats course and took AP stats in high school. I am also going to be retaking Bio 1 over the summer at a community college. 
       Fall semester 2020 i will be taking Bio 3 and some other courses including psy and stats. The question is if I should take chemistry or not. I don’t have much interest in chemistry but it is a requirement for bio majors. with the lab it is 5 credits, so if i don’t take it I could take both another stats and another psy course. 
      The major dilemma here is that i just don’t really know what to do. I used to be passionate about biology but not really anymore and the lab assignments were always very hard for me. I don’t want to give up on it that easily but it was a pretty hard class for me and thinking about taking those labs again is not a good thought. However, the thought of giving up on my biology path because i was not smart enough or was too lazy is not good either. I don’t mind data science but i’m really only perusing it because i could get a good job in it not because i enjoy it. I have liked my psy class this semester but it is only psy 101 so it’s pretty easy and i don’t really know what higher up psy could be like. Also with all of these i don’t know what kind of job i would really be able to get or be interested in while also making a decent wage.

I live in my hometown, but moved out of my parents house, I’m a double major in the school of music at my school in 2 of the hardest music degree programs they have there (they’re both very demanding). I pay most of my bills with music and wait tables to make some extra money for food and gas and fun stuff, and I’ve been dating my girlfriend for about 7 months. 

All I’ve wanted to do was be a freelance musician, to where if anyone needs me to play something  I can do it, and I’ve started making a small name for myself. However, with summer classes (and regular classes during the school year), work, playing gigs to pay bills, and rehearsals for music groups I play with, I don’t have a lot of free time. I make as much time as I can, a night or two a week, and spend it with my girlfriend and sometimes I’ll go a couple of weeks without seeing my parents. 

My girlfriend and family have been really on me lately about how I don’t make time (because I don’t have time) and need to hang with them more. They always talk about how much they love and support me when they come to shows but don’t understand that support comes after shows too, when I have to prepare for the next thing. Me and my girlfriend went out last night and even though we were spending time together, she was still upset about all the OTHER nights I could see her instead of enjoying the time we had together then. 

I’m just at the end of my rope here, because this is what I want to do with my life and now it’s finally starting to happen and I’m getting a grip on it my family and girlfriend want me to slow down and spend more time with them. I just feel like it’s super selfish on their parts to not understand and support what I’m doing, when I’ve worked hard for this.

The event was apparently at 2pm. We waited for HOURS and it was POURING outside. It was sooo annoying waiting outside for him. I have a bad ankle and I got the boot on, so that was very nice (no it wasn't it was hell). Also, he was 30 minutes late. That right there threw me off. He came at 2:30 and everyone was just getting wet. My foot was fucking wet it felt disgusting. The funny thing about it is we only talked to him for like a few seconds. Denzel is a pretty cool guy, but he is kinda awkward. I took a picture with him but he didn't bother to smile (I was cheesing like crazyyy) It's kind of funny knowing he's starting to blow up. I would never do that again, though. This was my first meet and greet and probably my last. Waiting hours just to meet the person for a few seconds? No thank you.

- Met someone selling a new iPhone 11 on Shpock/Craigslist. Reason for sale apparently was he wants a Samsung and said his mother bought him this phone
- He sent me an image of the receipt of the purchase with Carphone wa
of the phone. This had the date on it, how much he paid (£1449), the address of the store + phone number. 
- He sent me a picture over WhatsApp of his drivers license as well as a separate image of him holding it against his face. 
- He also gave me his Facebook as further proof and he’s very active on it. (I am now not sure if this Facebook is the correct Facebook of this man. Perhaps this is someone else, but that wouldn’t explain how he has the drivers license for this person)
- I spoke to him also over phone and he seemed very genuine. 
- He recommended me to pay over Paypal as Paypal covers you if anything happens. This made me trust him. (Tuesday)
- Then he contacted me and said that since his Paypal is new the £850 is on hold for 21 days, and he can’t wait that long, so he refunded the money to me and we did bank transfer instead. (Wednesday)
- On Thursday he said his partner posted it and said it should arrive on Friday before 1pm with Royal Mail. 
- It is now 7:20pm on Friday and it hasn’t arrived. 
- I have tried ringing him several times, goes to voicemail. Have searched his Facebook and his partners Facebook. 

A few days ago on FB he posted an image selling something so I asked if it’s still for sale to see if he will respond. 

We have a few plans of what to do but if anyone can give me advice please help.

My sister gave the basket to me and said ""here you carry it because you have big arms"" she really didn't mean much by it probably but it was nice to have someone notice it.

The other day I was eating lunch at the dining hall by myself and some people that I worked on a project on last semester came up to me and invited me to sit with them. That gesture was nice in itself and made me feel wanted. We were talking about times we've been drunk and I mention that I have a very high alcohol tolerance,  once taking 7 shots of tequila, a long island ice tea, a skittle bomb, and a beer and still being coherent. The group didn't believe that but a girl spoke up and was like ""I believe it, just look at him! He's got a lot of muscle!"" And regardless if that's the reason for my tolerance it felt great to be complimented like that. 

And then last night I was at the gym powerlifting and I saw an old classmate by the benches. I finished my last set and go over to him and asks if he needs a spot. He said he's all good and mentions I look great. Again, it made me feel really good about myself.

I have self-esteem issues. I don't get complimented often and these past few times really lifted my spirits. They were genuine. They weren't saying anything to make me feel better. They just said it.

I quickly looked away.

I think I kinda find the girl cute. Like I would like to know her a bit better.

My friends say I should do what they always do:
Sit beside the girl in classes and try doing a bit of small talk. And first try to be a friend. Then ask the girl out.

I dont like this way of asking out. Just because you dont show your intent from the beginning to a person. 

I am more direct and would prefer to get to know a girl in a more honest way.

So should I just straight up walk to her and ask her out? Like when I see her outside on campus.

Hey lads, fellow young adult here looking for some advice, maybe answers? So, I’m a female, currently twenty-two years old (turning twenty-three in a couple weeks) and I’ve never been in a relationship. I don’t feel bad about that, sometimes I feel I just lack a bit of self-awareness when it comes to going about that stuff. Anyway-my real issue-there’s this guy at my work-he’s about thirty years old, I think? I don’t have a problem with dating people that are a bit older than me, but the thing is, I guess I exude the ‘never been in a relationship and is super shy’ vibe, to some people, specifically him. We’ve been working together for about five full months now, and it wasn’t until a few days ago we started to “really” talk outside of both of us saying ‘hello,’ him saying something vaguely flirty, and ‘goodbye.’ Some of the conversations we’ve been having, have consisted of him flirting with me and me not knowing how to flirt, standing there saying “yeah?”; plus, some random conversations about hobbies, where we’re from, among other things. He’s also tried randomly holding/grabbing my hands?? But I think the main reason he started talking to me was because our (seasonal) job is ending in a couple of weeks and who gives a shit? 

In high school I got a lot of shit from people that would tell me they wanted to go on a date followed by the good old, “just kidding!” so of course, I still have the hardest time trusting whether someone is actually interested in me or is just saying shit for a goof. Now back to my thirty year old coworker- it was actually just a few days ago that he broke the ice and we’d actually converse during work hours. He told me that I, “seemed super shy,” and I replied with, “yeah,” and the conversation went from there. I attempted to make conversation and continued with- “what are you doing after the season’s over?” and he replied with, “I don’t know… moving in with you lol.” I just laughed and brushed off his comments, but he still continued to make comments like that (which honestly, I didn’t mind). The same day, when I was headed out, telling him the usual, “See you tomorrow!” when I leave, he responds with, “See you later, cutie!” and I didn’t know how to react, so I just smiled, tilted my head at him, and blushed like crazy, feeling super embarrassed, yet also flattered? 

Well, cut to the next day, he continued to flirt and continued saying things, one of them being, “You just keep luring me in,” to which I replied, “how? Lol,” and he would finish off by saying, “I don’t know… There’s just something about you.” The way he told me that really sold it, honestly, but I was still filled to the brim with doubt. When he finished saying that, I asked him if he was being serious or if he was just joking with me, to which he replied, “I don’t know, I’ll let you decipher that,” which confused the hell out of me and made me feel even more doubtful. Fast forward to today, we didn’t really talk at all, except for him telling me a stupid pick-up line and me laughing at it. He also didn’t really smile at me today, or even walk over, like he has been like he has the past few days, which caused me to ask one of my coworkers, I sometimes talk to, about him (throwback to me lacking self-awareness when it comes to relationships). I thought it was a good idea at the time (about four hours ago lol), but I’m sort of regretting asking at all. 

I asked my other coworker what the thirty year old’s deal was, to which my coworker asked me to clarify, to which I responded by saying, “I can’t tell if he’s joking ninety percent of the time. Is he being serious or is everything a joke to him?” my coworker responded by telling me that, “he’s just like that haha,” to which I responded, “I don’t know honestly. He’s been telling me stuff. Stuff like calling me a cutie? Do you think he means that?” he told me that he’s pretty sure the thirty year old guy has a girlfriend, doesn’t know why he’d say that, and is most likely joking with me, to which I said “Oh,” and went on to finish the most soul-crushing shift I’ve ever had.

This dude has been leading me on for three fucking days and he might even have a girlfriend. And if he (hypothetically) DOESN’T have a girlfriend, he’s either treating me like a fucking charity case and flirting with me to give me some self-esteem or something, flirting with me as a joke, testing his pick-up lines on me for the hell of it, OR he was planning to get some side action, because he sees how shy and easily flattered I am. Some other things that should be noted-he’s been talking to me like crazy at work, yet he hasn’t asked for my Snapchat, number, or anything, which I find strange; the few, minute-long conversations I’ve had with him for the past five months, before a few days ago, consist of him saying something vaguely flirtatious like, “are you following me cause you can’t get enough of me?”; I also haven’t “officially” asked him if he has a girlfriend, and I feel like at this point, if anything the other coworker I was talking to earlier might’ve given him a head’s up, so I wouldn’t be surprised if the thirty year old most likely lies to my face.

I’ve always found him attractive since I first saw him at work, but I was too much of a pussy to do anything about it. Now that I’m getting all of this attention from him out of the blue, I have my doubts that he even means anything he says. I’m really upset that he can’t just be forthcoming with his words and just tell me whether he’s joking or not, or if he has a girlfriend. It’s seriously bumming me out. Also, everything I wrote on here is stuff he’s actually told me. I don’t know how the statement “there’s just something about you,” with a longing stare can be contrived as anything other than flirtatious, so how the hell am I supposed to take it? I don’t mean to sound pretentious at all, I just really, really want some advice. This is all very new to me and I’ve mostly been having a hard time throwing myself into the dating game due to my crippling fear of rejection, and this is just complicating things and making me feel worse. 

Any incite about how I can go about this would be appreciated b/c this dude is absolutely draining me. Please and thank you!

TL,DR- I’m 22f, never been in a relationship, and shy. A guy at work who’s about eight years older than me has been overtly flirting with me, for the past three days, despite us working together for about five months. He’s not being clear about his intentions and when I asked him if he means any of the flirting, he said he’ll let me “decipher it.” A day later, after he was hardcore flirting with me, he didn’t really talk to me or smile at me, so I wanted to see if a coworker had any incite, about the guy flirting with me. This coworker told me that he’s pretty sure he has a girlfriend and might just be joking with me. The thirty year old guy didn’t ask for my snap, number or anything, which I found weird. I think if he has a gf, he’s looking to cheat; if no gf I think it’s all just some cruel joke orchestrated by him. Even though I’m really upset, I really want some closure and still want to see if he’s actually interested in me or not but don’t know how to go about it.

Okay, I understand thi 100%s. It was fun and chill, but understand how much better it could be. Because I was so insecure about having sex for the first time, I liked that it wasn’t serious so that I didn’t pressure myself to be good etc; I could just enjoy because I didn’t care what the guy would think. It was great fun. However I totally get how it would be sooo much better with someone I actually care for. And now I am looking forward to that, with enough confidence to actually enjoy it.

This post is also a bit long, apologies—I can be verbose. **Approx reading time: 11-13 mins (2,500ish words).** I also apologize for the clickbait-y title. It was originally meant to be ""Emotional Vulnerability"", but let's be honest, this title sounds far more interesting. I think it gives different feel to my work and my story of debauchery and general delinquency.

I wrote this little piece after I broke up with my girlfriend, about 1.5 months ago. I’ve talked to a few people from Reddit (some from this sub too) about this whole thing and have mostly moved on from it, but I just wanted to post this. It’s tough for me to completely open up to people in my daily life (especially with some of my hobbies), but it’s far easier to open up to people like y’all—I feel like I can write to you without being judged. To those of you who I’ve been talking to (whether it’s been over the last two years or mere days), I really appreciate the unique type of friendship and advice you’ve offered me, along with getting to know you guys and y’all becoming familiar with me. 

Still, there’s something therapeutic about writing out my feelings and submitting them with a bit more anonymity on a forum like this, so here we are. I’m sitting in my room on a lazy Saturday night, looking over all the drafts of posts that I never ended up submitting as I sip some tea and listen to modern-day Amy Winehouse soundalikes (Snoh Aalegra, Emeryld—shout to my boys who don’t care if their music taste is “feminine”) as I grow utterly nostalgic reading some of these (this post not included).

Anyways, this preface has been long enough. Here’s my mildly heartfelt story. I hope you enjoy it, find it informative, or perhaps can relate to it in some way. I was a bit apprehensive to post this, so I hope I don’t regret it.

-

“I’m not an emotional guy”, I thought to myself as I cried in my car.

But for some reason, I felt utterly shattered. At the time, I just didn’t—and several hours later—still don’t understand the intense emotions that I was feeling. I’ve never felt this way before.

For the uninitiated in my unentertaining saga, I ascertained that I would break up with my girlfriend before I moved to college. I broke up with her exactly a week ago. I tried to put it in the kindest words that my small heart was able to find, but the crestfallen expression on her face left me in a mess. Her eyes have always revealed her emotions, and this was no exception. I lost myself in them one last time, and proceeded to tightly grip her and pul her into a hug. She went limp on my shoulder. I could hear her crying. Her tears dripped down my jacket. It was a gift that she had given to me for my birthday. It was a crisp jacket by Schott, made with a thick horsehide leather. She was always worried about me getting into a crash on my motorcycle and turning into a human crayon, so she purchased the jacket for me. I wore it every time I picked her up on my bike, and, out of habit, I had done it today. 

I didn’t know if I should give it back to her. I decided to keep her gifts, and told her to keep mine. We shouldn’t look at it with sadness, our relationship was wonderful.

I’m not an emotional guy. I swear.

I spent most of that Saturday in bed. I didn’t work out, didn’t get too much work done either. I flaked on my training partner. He understood. I ended up going out with my friends to Clé *(a/n: s.o htx)* later that night, but I wasn’t really feeling it. On Sunday, I got back on track with my schedule. I just felt a bit more hollow and robotic than normal.

My best friend told me to go out with him and some other buddies on that Tuesday. I figured I would. It just felt vapid. We paid an outrageous amount for two bottles of Grey Goose and a bottle of Hennessy. My friends introduced me to a couple girls that night, but I just didn’t want to talk to them. I didn’t feel like drinking, and left early.

That day, when I drove back in my dad’s R8 (he doesn’t mind at all) that I had pulled out of the family garage, I drove particularly recklessly that day, attempting to invoke some sort of excitement. Nothing. Powered through a few turns, went double the limit on the highway. My heart-rate remained steady. That was uncharacteristic for me, it didn’t take much to get adrenaline pumping through my system, if I’m being honest.

It’s funny. I should be so grateful. Caring friends, a wonderful family, a wealthy background, a bright future. I shouldn’t feel so torn up about some stupid breakup. I shouldn’t let it catapult me into some sort of mild, prolonged sadness.

But it still did.

*A/N: I think at this point, it’s important to note that your mental health is one of those things that is often taken for granted. Even the slightest bit of trauma and worries can have effects on you. You must take the time to be reflective/mindful and acknowledge these issues, followed by seeking out treatment for them. I failed to do this for a long time.*

Anyways, my core group of friends invited me to dinner with them all on Friday. No shenanigans, no partying, none of it—just a group of friends gathering before college started. I’ll admit, I was happy to be around all of them, to catch up, exchange some stories, and get some face-time with all of them. It was good to get to talk to them all. I didn’t reveal that I was torn up about the breakup, but I’m sure some of them could infer that it had left me a bit less soulful. My best friend, J, and his girlfriend, offered to introduce me to one of her friends and go out on a double date next week. I agreed. I don’t want anything serious, but they’re both well-aware of my intentions. We’ll see how it goes.

*A/N (me, a handful of weeks older): It went okay. She was cute and bubbly. It’s obvious that J’s girlfriend chose her and knew what I was looking for. She got a little drunk and I, mildly intoxicated myself, had to carry her to the Uber since she wasn’t a fan of her heels. We had fun that night. It was nice. She was a bit too cuddly considering the fact that we had met literally hours beforehand though. I just wanted to sleep afterwards.*

Here’s the one thing. The guys in my friend group can be idiots sometimes, but they know how to have a good time. After dinner, they pushed me to go out with them, which I hesitantly agreed to. After, they told me what they had really planned.

So this isn’t the first time that I’ve dabbled with a sex provider. I’ve been regularly seeing escorts ever since I had turned 18. I have a decent amount of experience with providers. Doubles sessions, I once hired a girl to spend 24 hours with my ex and I (to get my bi-curious ex comfortable with her before proceeding), probably over 35 bookings at this point (most were around 4 hours apiece, as I like longer appointments). Our group is very familiar with them in general, it’s not considered taboo among us and is actually rather common. So when they told me they had booked me an overnight, their treat, with my favorite escort in the area, I was both surprised and unsurprised. Frankly, I was most concerned that they had my ID available for screening info. I think they had it saved from an old AirBnb booking where we had to send in our IDs.

*A/N: Please don’t inquire too much about escorts/providers in the comment section. I don’t want to break any serious rules by disclosing any details on how to book an escort. I feel like I’ve already done that in a comment here before. If you’re curious about general details not related to actually booking an escort but rather the experience, feel free to ask in the comments since that shouldn’t be a big issue (at least, I’d hope that this sub is kosher with it, since I’m avoiding source talk); if you want to learn how to book a escort, please refrain from asking in a comment and DM me instead.*

Part of me didn’t want to go through with it, but equally, my irrational, lizard-brained side decided to slither out and influence my actions.

So I hopped in my car and drove to her incall, less than two miles away, perched in a nicer apartment downtown. As the elevator made a “ding” sound at each level, my heart began to beat more and more quickly. I’m not usually nervous about many things, but I’ll admit, I was nervous to be with this woman—it was my first time seeing her in nearly a year. She still had my screening info on file, but so much had changed since our last rendezvous. I was mostly faithful to my girlfriend during our relationship, and this was my longest hiatus from the “single life”. I felt like a very different man than the one she had seen nearly a year ago. I was taken out of my thoughts as the elevator stopped, and I slowly walked to the door with her apartment number emblazoned next to it.

I checked my phone to find that I was instructed to open the door—it was already unlocked.

When I walked into her room, greeted by her sweet smell and beautiful smile, my nerves melted and I was instantly soothed. I was still very fresh and clean, so there was no necessity for a shower (but please take a shower for your provider’s sake if you’re even the slightest bit sweaty or unclean). We talked for a little bit and I complimented her new incall. It was in a beautiful area and the view of the city’s lights was intoxicated. She was clearly doing well for herself.

Sex was a big part of the relationship between my girl and I. It’s been a big part in nearly all of my relationships. I think it’s a great way for me to express myself and emotionally connect with a girl. It wasn’t the sex that had made me felt the way I had that night, however.

We later moved to her bed and she rested her head on my chest and draped herself over me as she listened to me spill my heart, in almost the exact same position that my ex would find herself in when she fell asleep on me. This was different though. It made me felt loved in a way that I had never felt before. Maybe it was her attentive listening, that you could tell that she was truly processing every word I said, as she thoughtfully crafted a response.

I know, I know, you don’t have to say it. I know that this is her job, that it’s a bit of an illusion (IOP is the term used by most hobbyists to describe this type of service), that she obviously doesn’t love me. That’s entirely true, but that warm feeling that I had that night was something that I’ve never experienced before. We spoke for hours. I confided my concerns with her about my previous relationships, namely apathy towards the relationship and how I felt that I had treated my exes as expendable. How I had cheated too often, as had most of my friends. I let their influence get to me, however I would have to shoulder most of the blame myself. I felt like I gave in too easily to temptations, that I took a lot of my relationships for granted, and how the last week had proved that to me (as I went into the breakup blasé and left as a hollow version of the man I was).

-

I told her to hit me. She slapped me across the face lightly. I told her to hit me again. This time it stung. Once more, I repeated “again” and her slap left my face tingling. It was a good feeling.

The experience was utterly cathartic, as I slowly released endorphins while she bucked on top of me, slapping me at regular intervals. The routine 10mg of Cialis that I had taken this morning (not for ED, but for pumps in the gym and mild blood pressure control), 500mg of exogenous Testosterone in my system, and a tendency to deathgrip my dick when masturbating *(A/N: shout out to my boys with deathgrip syndrome)* ensured that our foray into pleasure lasted quite a while. I felt like I was in a mildly drugged mental state by the end of it, and my physical state was mildly bruised and scratched up as well. My wits slowly returned to me as we sat in bed, both sweaty and exhausted. I was sweetly petted to sleep as she laid on my chest.

-

I woke up at my usual time that morning and bid my favorite provider adieu after taking a quick shower with her. I put my clothes back on and dragged my 40mm Chelsea heels back to my car. Once I entered the safety of my cockpit, I sat there for short time, thinking back to the events of the previous night. It was at that point that the tears began streaming down my face. I'm not entirely sure why I cried that morning. All I knew was that I felt broken and empty inside. I felt like my previous emotional attachments had meant nothing, and that I never felt truly ""loved"" in my life. I had been in numerous relationships and never felt this way, the way that I was coaxed into in the course of a single night with this woman. I had compartmentalized this side of myself and pushed it into the back of my head.

-

This whole piece is more than a story about breaking up with a pretty girl and having the emotions literally fucked out of me by an escort. For me, this experience is weird. I feel like I’ve suppressed my emotions for years. I think it has a lot to do with my parents being absent in my life starting my Junior year of HS (they began to travel a lot for business, and slowly, for pleasure). I only saw them a few times per year for short one-week periods during HS, and will probably see them far less as I move to college.

*A/N: Yep. Here's to seeing my parents twice per year from here on.*

-

So listen y’all—I know my writing is kind of shit (and cliché-laden) and this post is all over the place. Regardless. I hope this is the kind of content that this sub might be interested in as it depicts the honest reality as a youngadult. I hope to see a similar subset of stories like this. I feel like we can really learn from each other’s unique experiences. I know this is the type of content that I would like to see (obviously it doesn’t have to be hookers and parties, I just like the look into someone’s life with complete candor).

I just wanted to provide some contrast from some of the bullshit stories that get posted here sometimes (""my pet zebra named &lt;insert *quirky* name&gt; just did _, &lt;something something&gt;"" or whatever, iykyk). I really just wanted to post it because I wrote this when I was feeling a bit vulnerable and open and wanted to express myself without genuine fear of judgement. Feel free to ask me questions about any of this, if you’re interested. I'm going to be posting a few other drafts that I've written up but never shared over the next week or two—if you guys would actually like to see more content like this.

I'm working fulltime and doing online school in the town that I graduated high school in. Lots of my friends are either off at college or moved away. Hell, even my older brothers are gone. I feel as if I'm the only one left in a socially dead area because what was once a HUGE vibrant social circle that I had from high school has turned into a monotony of working, writing papers in my basement, and barely seeing the few people that did stick around because they're busy doing the same thing I am. I feel too old and mature to be hanging around high schoolers and I feel too young and immature to be hanging with people that are a few years older than me. And, of the people my age, most are doing what I'm doing and are pretty damn depressed and busy, so much so that they rarely get out to chill.

I'm working on making new friends in older age groups but it's been tough. Making progress though.

Acne is something that in a lot of instances sticks on you years after you´ve dealt with puberty, they hang tight like the last chip in a pringles can. Personally im in my early 20´s and those little rascals refused to leave, they didn´t even pay rent. 

So heres a quick, basically free guide to getting rid of your unwanted rentee´s. 

Wash your bedsheats every week. And here i mean every god damn week, thats the first. Sundays are a prime day seing as you´re either in your room sleeping, gaming or hungover from the day before. It takes no time.

Second, wash your face every evening with a warm cloth! I cannot stress this any more! It removes dead skin, you can use soap but i just use hot water and have had good results with that. 

And thats it.

Of course its not that easy for everyone, if its REALLY bad, im talking rather than unwanted rentee´s were talking project X in your face you should contact a doctor to get something to help with it, (beware 9/10 its antibiotics and you dont want to use too much of that), but yeah.

Something else can also come down to what youre eating, your rentee´s love sugar, if they can get their hands on it they´ll go WILD. You love soda? Get something sugarfree! In my personal experience my rentee´s took all that milk and bulked up like crazy on it, so you can keep that in mind!

&amp;#x200B;

I had bills but I don't really have much debt (minus student loans but oh well) and I only opened up a credit card this year. My parents are dead beat and literally I've never been taught how to adult.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I'm currently trying to figure out is how to manage my bills, expenses, rent and credit card debt. I currently have 1 credit card with a very good score of 750+ but high revolving utilization due to unexpected bills. I want to keep my credit score high but since I'm moving I'm going to have a lot of new bills (plane ticket, deposit on an apartment I'm renting, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

So, how do I keep my credit score up, my revolving utilization low, and my debt manageable? 

&amp;#x200B;

Like do I open up more credit cards to spread my bills across to lower the stress on my one card? I'm pretty good at putting small daily life stuff like food on my debit card (I try to keep a decent savings account for daily use).

&amp;#x200B;

Because I'm renting an apartment I need to keep my credit score up high and am afraid if I open a new credit card it might lower my overall score.

For the past 3 months I've (21m) been with what I thought was an amazing girl (21f). We were a bit long distance but we drove every weekend to see each other. Throughout the week we sent each other love letters and called at least once a day if not more. Her parents love me and vise versa and everything seemed amazing.

Then out of nowhere, all the affection died. Her libido died and she no longer wanted to cuddle or kiss or really anything. I thought maybe it was medication or school so I gave it time and just made sure to be there for her incase anything was going on. Eventually I realized it was consistent and so yesterday I messaged her about it. I told her I felt the affection had died and that it was bothering me. 

Her response was that it wasn't who she was. All the affection was just for me and that she no longer wanted to do it. No communication about it and no care about how it affected me. Then she brought up my mental health and that it was causing strains in the relationship when I had not had any issues for nearly the entirety of the relationship. It felt like a huge punch to the gut and then eventually by the end of the conversation,, she broke it off and said she lost feelings for me. I had meant it every time I said I love you to her but now I keep questioning myself on when she had stopped meaning it. Its tearing me up cause she was the first girlfriend I had where I had actual hope it would last.

Maybe it’s not that deep but it’s making me really anxious about showing up to work because I feel like everyone’s judging me and thinks I’m an incompetent old hag.

Every day is just so much the same. I tried so, so hard to make friends through clubs and things in college, but was never able to connect. I've never really been good at socialising, and my high school friends were made because *they* approached *me*...I was in a college where everyone knew each other in high school, but I went to one in a different city. Working has been no better; my coworkers are just coworkers. There's no breaks at the same time, just one-person-at-a-time so I can't exactly sit and interact. I don't really need a lot of friends, I just wish I could connect with someone, have someone irl.

This is only part of it, though. I'm going nowhere. I at least wanted something where I felt like I was doing something good.

So at the beginning of this year my finances were in a mess after my parents pulled the plug on my support I used me credit cards (largely empty at the time) to finance the gap as I scrambled to get a job. This ended up taking 5 months as the first half was me basically seeing if there was anyway for me to get a job (part time) and stay in school but eventually after nothing I decided to declare a financial emergency and crash out of University to fix the situation. There is a long complicated reason for why my parents acted they way they did and I understand why (though I am still salty about it, in the end its their money and they can decide how to spend i). I have moved on

Anyway after crashing out of school being unemployed for a while and find ever more creative ways to cut food to make sure the stores I had could last months rather than weeks (I operated on a rent only policy) {Though truth be told I probably spent more when I was broke on food than when I am making money}. February things looked bleak, I had finally ran out of credit my parents had agreed to reverse their decision to help but not bail me out and I finally got a job but was shortly their after fired for not being the right fit and I was beginning to be behind on my rent payments. I did (thank god) land a second job so my contingency plan of going on welfare and crashing out of a lease I couldn't afford could wait. 

I worked solid 40 hour weeks and as the cash rolled in I was able to stabilize the situation. I then faced a choice do I balance all my expenses and just pay down my debt gradually? or do I pay somethings faster than others to shorten the overall period in which I pay everything? I eventually did a bit of both I decided to pay off as much of my lease as I could and maintaining my balance (maxed out) In August I finally paid my lease some 4 months ahead of me and I decided to stop paying rent and start tackling my debt mountain. 

Today, even after I finally rescinded my financial emergency declaration and spending is returning back to a new normal (roughly 35-45% ish of my income) I am pleased to announce to the world that my assets vs. debts is nearing the black again (notwithstanding student loans of course) and I am really happy!! I am going to pay off the remainder of my lease and then finish the fight and get my balance back to zero by end of January.

I took lessons as a kid but I never actually learned how to tread water. A normal interaction with someone who is finding out for the first time that I can't swim goes almost invariably like this:

Me: ""I can't swim""

Other: ""Wow! You really can't swim?""

Me: ""Well actually, I can swim. I can do the backstroke and crawl but I can't tread water so I never go where the water is above my head""

Other: ""Oh, yeah you can't swim"". 

I guess my question is ""How much of a leap is it from doing strokes to treading water?"" I've known how to do the backstroke and crawl for about 3 years now and I've been meaning to learn how to tread water but I've almost drowned every time I try to learn. Everyone I know claims they just figured out how to tread water but I can't for the life of me figure it out.

Anyone else have tips to dealing with an overbearing mother who doesn’t think I am capable of making my (25y/o) own decisions? And any decisions, personal opinions I have, or choices must be a result of someone else’s influence, in her eyes(my boyfriend, which then she sees him as bad, my friends, or just anyone close to me), and not my own brain? If whatever I do doesn’t align with her thoughts then she starts picking at those close to me. 

She worries too much about everything with no sound logic, critiques those close to me, especially boyfriend (of 4 years)...for choices I make. She’s subtle in the way she judges, very passive, but I know her so well that she doesn’t need to come out and scream it to my face. 

She assumes the worst, especially my relationship. With no sound logic or facts. And again, does so very subtly. Never straight to my face but indirectly or says things to my dad or friends about how she really feels. 
Even though there hasn’t been anything to give her a reason. 


There has been times that my mom “fact - checks” me and txts my friends to see if I’m really with or them or with my bf. I don’t understand this behavior. It’s embarrassing but my  close friends for years are understanding about it.  

I don’t want to start resenting her. I care about her and enjoy my time with her, except when these things happen it makes me despise her.  She’s pushing me away.

To add:


 as I’ve gotten older, it’s not that she’s reaching out to my friends because I’m not answering. She just wants to see if I’m actually with them or if I’m lying about something. It’s weird because I don’t lie about it...
For example..
I told my mom by best friend was out of town on my birthday, so I was just gonna do a dinner with my boyfriend, and the following day , me my bf and best friend and her guy would go get brunch to celebrate

My mom proceeds to txt my best friend behind my back to see if she’s out of town that day for real, or did my bf just not invite my friends and isolate me (which he doesn’t do, we have no issues of abuse or control)

I’m almost done with college and I still feel crazy emotional like a hormonal teenager. Everything matters so much, I carry about the stupidest things, I cry all the time, have huge mood swings, am full of angst, have silly romantic fantasies and all consuming infatuations, feel confused and unsure of my self and am just filled with doubt and insecurity etc. It seems very much like the kind of things a 15 or 16 year old girl would feel and think. 

When I think about it it makes me feel really embarrassed. 

My friends, and even just people I meet, automatically try to protect/mentor/fix me. I know they just want to help, and I genuinely appreciate it, but it does make me feel inferior.  But I guess it’s my fault, because I clearly give out that vibe of “help me!” I mean, here I am asking for advice from strangers. 

I don’t even know what I’m asking. I guess I’m curious to know if this is something other/many 20 somethings experience? Is it something I will eventually grow out of or am I stuck?

I'm great at customer service jobs, but there is really no ""risk"" with those types of jobs. I mess up and it's not a huge deal because it's easily fixable.
The work that paralegals do is substantive and if I mess up, I could get an attorney disbarred. I could fuck up an entire case, I could have my entire reputation tarnished because the legal community in my city is very small, and have to change my career.
I guess I'm just scared of the additional responsibilities that come along with a career, there's so much risk involved and it's scary. I don't feel like I'm grasping the information I need to know very well due to additional stress in my personal life. I feel like I'm not prepared to have a job with so much pressure involved.

I don’t have many friends, but my longest running friend dropped me yesterday because his girlfriend is overly possessive and not only was stalking me but found out enough about me to decide that she hates me so he has to hate me too. I had to block her number because she was threatening me and verbally assaulting me for having the audacity to be still in contact with *her man*. She found me on all social media and keeps making more anytime I block her because she’s convinced I’m after him.

If that wasn’t bad, I found out from someone else that said friend has has been living with the girls family for the past few months because they’re engaged after only 6 months of dating. This is crazy to me because he is 22 and she is 17 nearing 18. I don’t understand how her parents allow any of this in the first place or how he puts up with the fact that this little girl is a complete psycho and is extremely abusive. (Yes, I am aware the almost 5 year age gap is messed up. I brought it up to him when they first started dating and he got very annoyed with me since *the age of consent is 16 and therefore it’s totally legal especially since I have parental consent*)

That was my best and only close friend. Given the fact that they’re engaged and living together, our friendship is likely over for good now. I’ll never understand girls like that who don’t allow their partners to have friends and who don’t trust them yet stay with them. 

I just hate all of this. I absolutely hate it. It’s not fair in the least bit. I guess being rendered friendless is fine.",youngadults,"Best friend dropped me for a girl, and I just want to vent about it.",0.0

I dropped out as I feared that I would kill myself if I didn't.

To take a piece out of it;

&gt; I think that when you're a ""kid"" (in the loose sense of the word), it's really a part of your identity. People give you free passes to be stupid, they enthuse about your future, you have coming of age stuff like getting your license or graduating high school, tons of occasions where people pay attention to you, and you feel special. (I'm American and we're big on the ""cult of youth"".) So when you feel that slipping away, it's a huge deal. 

~

&gt; I can still remember high school graduation like it was yesterday. As a child and teenager, it felt like college was the end. I didn't even think about not being a student, about being an ""adult"".


With everything that has happened in bloody 2020 and the last half-decade or so,  I've just had more than enough time to just reflect on the days gone.  I don't dislike being an adult, but man do I miss having the 'free pass to be stupid', I miss having an essay due or an exam as the most pressing thing to worry about, I miss having friends I've known for 15+ years being just being a short walk away, I miss having stupid class clowns around, extracurriculars, somehow I miss high-school.


I probably sound boomer-y, venty and whiny and I apologise, but Christ does it feel like I've had to give up so many things that made me happy in order to be a grown up and I'm envious of the lack of responsibilities and care in the world that as a teenager I once had.",youngadults,Do you ever miss being young 'young'?,0.0

So on a daily basis I would to school then a support group (twice a week with my sisters) then work which is all pretty 
cramped in.

I found a redditor on r/mentalhealth who gave me methods to ease up on depression (if you're struggling with that, it's a great place for advice btw)

So I wanted to try and earn more money for many reasons and recently I became a music teacher at my sisters middle/high school which was really a life changing experience but as it goes on I get more stressed and more tense but I try to stay ""nice"" for the kids I'm teaching. (Plz give your opinion on this one) I think I may be a bad teacher because well obviously it isn't their fault but sometimes I get some sort of trigger from almost anything that my stepfather has said to me in the past like some jokes they make with eachother.

They found nothing and the doctor said that it's possible it's one of those things that happen once and then never again.

A few months later I had what in Sweden is called an EEG examination (to check if you have any epileptic weaknesses) I was super sure everything would be fine and there would be nothing wrong but the doctor called me back after a couple weeks and told me that I'm in high risk to get another seizure. It was difficult to say if I had an epileptic diagnosis since you need to have had at least two seizure to get it but because of the examination I was offered medicine and I decided to take it.

I am in the middle of working myself up to the full dosage I'm supposed to take (meaning I am currently not taking was is the goal dosage that's supposed to help prevent any more seizures) and lo and behold yesterday I had _another_ seizure...

I didn't have to go to the hospital this time but I did call around to a couple of doctors to check what I should do. My doctor called and said that now at least they can set a certain epilepsi diagnosis which mean that I'll get to talk to a nurse about it and everything around it. Kinda pissed that now I'm not allowed to drive for a year tho lol.

And I dunno... I just felt like sharing. I just feel so weird since I never had any seizures as a kid and suddenly now when I'm grown up and in my 20's I get epilepsi...

I know I should’ve keep it short and sweet and I edited out a bunch of what I wrote at first/wanted to say, but I like this professor, and I missed her, and I wanted I’ve been on a leave of absence and my friend said she was asking about me but still this was too long and I feel so embarrassed now and guilty for making her read all that.

So I found out that my dad was gay when I was 10. My parents would constantly fight and I eventually caught on to what was happening. My earliest memory of me finding out that my dad was gay was when I heard my mom yell at him for coming back home very late around 2 am and she would not let my dad in our apartment room. I didn't quite understand what was going on. I also remember this one time when I was 15 when my dad came back home from work late at night, and I was up and I tried to hear what was going on from the staircase. She was crying out about this dating website I guess, I'm not quite sure, which my dad was on. His username was ""something...chupadick"" (Chupa dick in Spanish means suck dick) (We travel to different countries a lot due to my dad's job, especially to Spanish speaking countries which is why they know Spanish).

My mom started to get depressed and started sleeping for hours and hours. She has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and she has been taking medication for a few years now.

My mom has also thrown and broken my dad's phone twice because she found him texting guys.

I've also overheard my dad talking to my mom about the fact that he does not want his family (His sisters, parents, etc) to know about his sexuality.

I've found out that he was in a relationship with this one guy, let's name him ""Tom"" I guess since I was 15? And I have been seeing him texting that guy for a long while now. Just yesterday I saw him texting that same guy.

My family (My mom, dad, and a younger brother who is 15) are about to move to another country for approximately 3-4 years due to my dad's job in December but I am staying here in my dad's country because I go to university here. I am very worried about how they are gonna be.

Currently, my dad and my mom are living in separate homes (They are not divorced). Initially, we were all living in the same place but that was a problem for my dad because it was very far from his workplace, taking around 1.30-2 hours for him to reach there. However, it was convenient for my brother because that place was quite close to my brother's school, only taking 15 minutes to reach there. So I guess my dad prioritized my brother's comfort and decided to just have himself move out of the place and move to another place that is a lot closer to his workplace. Now we only have one car so he wanted my mom to have the car so she could send my brother to school and go grocery shopping and all that. My dad would come back home every Friday or Saturday. I also live separate from them now that I go to uni, I am no longer living with my mom and my younger brother. But I would go back to see them every Friday.

So basically my mom is now spending most of her time with my 15-year-old brother who is addicted to video games. He does not really talk with us much. We used to be very close but he kind of stopped talking to me and he also doesn't really talk much with mom and dad. So my mom has also been upset with him cause he doesn't really talk to her. I am very worried about my mom. She still loves my dad even though she knows that he doesn't love the same.

I just feel like my parents are not so compatible with each other.

My dad's sleep schedule is pretty great. He wakes up early in the morning and tries to go bed early: My mom on the other hand sleeps all day most of the time and she would wake up at around 7 pm-8 pm when she's not feeling great and she would be active at night, watching tv and all which makes my dad a bit upset because he is not able to sleep cause of her going in and out the room, switching the lights on and off and having the tv playing.

My dad is generally a calm person and he is also quite a logical, very simple guy, very collected: my mom, on the other hand, she's very silly, very sweet, she's quite childish in a sense where she talks and acts like a child sometimes, and she is also very emotional.

Anyways, so about yesterday, my mom, dad, and I went to his single room place to get things that we wanted for their trip to another country (I was just accompanying them and help them organize things). He had many boxes filled with our old books and toys and my mom was very happy to see them. She was very happy when she found her old books that she thought went missing. So while she was busy with that, I went to just chill on his bed but then I saw a condom looking packet on his nightstand. I was very shocked when I saw that. I kept thinking that was not possible, there's no way that's a condom package because first of all he is my dad, there's no way! Second of all he is gay, right? I then picked it up while both my parents were turning their backs and I read the packet and it said ""water-based lube"". When I saw that it felt so numb but I just acted like I didn't see anything.

Do I hate my dad: I used to resent my dad so much when I was younger. We used to fight quite often because I was very stubborn and I used to think that he favored my younger more. But now I don't really resent him. I really appreciate how much he has done for us. He sent both my brother and I to private schools although we were low on money. He always prioritized us. I hate how he cheated on my mom and made my mom suffer so much. And still keeps cheating behind our backs. Weirdly, when I see him texting guys, it doesn't really make me react. I don't know if it's because I am used to it but I would do anything for my mom to not see the texts. Yesterday, when my mom was getting close to the nightstand in my dad's room, I stood in front of it so she wouldn't see it. I hate my dad for cheating and doing such things behind our backs and pretending like he didn't do anything.

I can't stop thinking about it. The lube packet in his room. Every time I think about it, it makes me cry and it makes me imagine what went down and how my mom would react if she saw it. It reminds me of all the times that my mom cried and their fights.

I am very worried. I don't think my brother knows anything about what is going on. I don't have the guts to even tell him. I just really want my family to be happy. I dont know what to do

I am very sorry about the fact that I didn't organize this well, I was just typing whatever went in my mind. Also English is not my first language so I apologize if this doesn't make much sense/confusing)",youngadults,"My gay dad and my depressed mom, what should I do",0.0

It started off wonderful. I was a very nice, shy kid but I did my best to be kind and fair to those around me. Aside from getting in fights with my older brother, I was a relatively normal and intelligent kid. Over time I began to focus more on school and work toward becoming the young adult I always wanted to become. In high school I attended a program called AICE which essentially is a college curriculum where you pass examinations for college credit. By 17 I graduated and had my AICE Diploma along with 19 college credits and a full ride scholarship.

Then I moved out.

At 18 I left home and moved without telling my parents. They were devastated and admittedly didn’t even remotely deserve that. But I thought at the time that I was doing the right thing. I was with other family and was happier in that neighborhood. I continued going to school, got part time job and figured things were going well. However, I wasn’t able to transfer to a university when I planned to and my life started to crumble. My aunt wanted me out, I wasn’t making many friends and my family seemed to be disappointed in me. I eventually fell in with the wrong crowd, and less than a month after my 19th birthday I was arrested for a multitude of felonies.

Now I’m 20 and I’m stuck back home with my parents. I lost my job, can’t pay for my car, got removed from the university I applied to transfer to after getting my AA from a community college, and I lost my full ride scholarship. I can’t work, I can’t go to university and I can never fulfill my lifelong dream of being a police officer. I wasted what was an immense amount of effort in one night. Nowadays I sit in my room taking up food, water and space and contemplate committing suicide on a daily basis.

I get sentenced in 2 weeks. I’m facing an upwards of life in prison because of how the law works in my state, but regardless of the time I spend in prison or jail I will likely end my life. I don’t believe that at this stage or any future stage of my development that I will ever get over or move on from my criminal charges. No matter what anybody says, your crimes DO define you. If you’re dictated by a background check, they define you. If you live with mommy and daddy at 20 years old and never got to develop into the adult you should’ve, you’re defined by your actions.

The suicide will be coming shortly, and I have myself to blame. I want to apologize to God or whatever runs the world for wasting its energy on producing me. I’d like to apologize to my parents for wasting time on a soon to be felon because they deserved an adult son who followed his dreams and found happiness. I’d like to apologize to the court system for wasting its time on me for my actions, and I’d like to hope that there is not an afterlife.

I move into college August 30, which is very exciting! However I am worried about one thing, being a guy that he’s been relatively weird to me and my roommate. 

At orientation he: 
-took pictures of me without me knowing (nothing bad but I still don’t like it)

-told me about his *serious personal trauma* after only being acquaintances with him for at most 7 hours (this came up because I had been upset and somewhat vulnerable emotionally about a more minor issue. dunno why he thought that was an appropriate response)

-knowing I was in a relationship, called me hot (mostly made me uncomfortable, this was out of nowhere when I just sent a photo of my school id to show how the picture wasn’t place in the box properly) 

With my roommate he:
-acts kind of possessive and claimed her as his

-spammed her when she didn’t respond once for 3 hours 

-not stop contacting her even when she didn’t respond to any attempt for about a month

Neither of us have spoken to him in a month or so, however there are issues in that 1) we know he’s mostly likely living in the same residentially area as us (potentially even the same building), and 2) he joined one of my classes during orientation

These both kind of put us (and me especially) in a weird place because it’s not as easy as just removing him and going about our days. I’ve been kind of worrying over our shared class because I have NO intentions of being near him, and I’ve been trying to figure out what the best method would be to guarantee me not having him sit next to me in class.

So I just moved to a new town on the west coast and it's givin me pretty hipster hippie vibes.

And everyone is NICE. Everyone wants to talk to you and everyone says hi and howdy. I've only been here for a week but I already feel like the asshole. Back home, I was the nice guy. Sure I speak rough but so did everyone. Only difference was I'm not violent. I'm kind to people.

But when I came here OMG I feel like such an asshole! Even the littlest mention of where I grew up makes people afraid to talk to me!

Like I know not everyone's like that here but I'm kind of missing home where screaming at your friend until your voices went away was the normal. Where riots and dumpsterfires were like every other week. Where I could talk shit in public and no one batted an eye because everyone talked shit.

Like if I could sum up my life where I'm from it's that meme of the opossum saying fuck society, Eat trash, kill your Gods, be free! Like we were literal trash humans who drank vodka from dumpsters and ate food from the trash in the back of restaurants. Like that's who I am.

And now I'm living in a hippie town and I simultaneously love it yet hate it. Like I already feel like I can be more expressive here. Like I have more opportunities.

I’m moving Friday. I’m excited, but understandably nervous, and at the moment, sad. One of my best friends moved away today to a school 5 hours away from mine. My friend group got together for one last time yesterday and all we did was talk the whole time. Two of them stayed at my house until 2am just talking about life and reflecting, including the guy moving today. 

My other best friend is moving to a school that is also 5 hours away from me. 

My boyfriend moved away a year and a half ago 7 hours away because his family had to move. 

Every friend I love is so far away from me. My friend group is unbelievably close and it took us a while to get there. It seems just as everything gets to the point where we are at relationally, only to have it ripped apart. 

The same thing happened when my boyfriend moved away. (Still together. Long distance ftw) We all are in the same friend group and regardless of our romantic relationship, he was my best friend and honestly, the backbone of our friend group and the dynamic changed when he left. We were all really broken up about it but never really talked about it, we just dealt.  The three of us that were left last night talked about him and how we wish things could have been different and how we wish he could have been with us. (For context, my friend group is 3 guys and 2 girls. The two left at my house late into the night were 2 of the guys who were closest to my boyfriend).  

And honestly, I feel kind of alone now that the three people I love most are going to be far away from me and I have no idea when I’ll see them next. 

It took us so long to get to the point where we were so close and now it’s just gone all over again, just like it did when my boyfriend left. 

We all plan to remain friends but it’s just hard, ya know?

I’m also afraid that making friends in college may be a struggle for me because I’ll just compare that friendship to the closeness I have with my current best friends

This is a message to all you young adults out there going through a bad situation. I recently got out of a bad situation with my parents, they were bullying me and telling me what to become rather that what I wanted to be. I would be told that I wouldn't amount to anything that I should stop trying. It affected me in a way that made me become isolated and not talk to anyone. Last month I snapped because I was so tired of it that I moved back to my hometown and the amount of positivity and love I got when I got back was amazing. I already have noticed a positive impact toward myself and I haven't even been here 2 weeks yet. This story is to tell you that even when you feel like nothing someone out there loves and cares about you because you matter. If all else just know I love and care about you because everyone deserves to have good mental health.

To make matters worse, him going to jail will mean that I and the entire family will be losing our health insurance. I already have depression and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants. I feel so selfish for even thinking about it, but I don't know how I'm going to pay for my meds.

I quit my job back in April due to suicidal thoughts unrelated to this (yeah, not a great time to find out your dad's a pedo). I lost my last job and dropped out of college following a suicide attempt, leaving me with $20k in debt and no degree. The one before *that* I also quit due to depression and anxiety.

I don't want to kill myself. I mean, I do, but I don't *want to* want to kill myself. And I can't because, as much as I'm hurting, I know that I would hurt my family even worse.

No matter how much I've tried to work on that, ive always been boring. Nobody wants to hang out with a boring guy, so ive been lonely pretty much my whole life. Because of this, I'm pretty sure ive developed some wierd attachment issues. Coming from a life of no friends to being in a group of friends made me really happy. I eventually came to realize that while im part of the group, I'm easily the least favorite friend. I could write a whole essay on everything they've done to make me feel inadequate, but itd just be pointless fluff. 
 
When it comes down to it, it's not like they hate me. They still clearly like me, just not as much as they like each other. And i dont like that. I dont like being the second rate friend. For the time being, Ive withdrawn myself from the group while i sort out my mental state and figure out how i want to go forward when it comes to interacting with them. I can't stay like this forever though, being around them is very awkward when there's clearly something wrong with my mood. But heres the catch: I work with them. I have to see them 6 days a week. Normally I would just avoid them and cut them off if they make me feel that bad around them, But that's not exactly an option. So when it comes down to it, there are only 2 things that I could conceivably do to resolve my emotions surrounding this: 
 
1. Try even harder to be good friends with each of them so they'll like me as much as they like each other. At worst, I could see this backfiring on me. At best, I'll probably wind up back at square one when i realize my efforts haven't gotten me anywhere.
 
2. Quit my job. Yeah, I get paid too well to do that anytime soon. Maybe in a year when im qualified for internships, but until then, this isnt exactly an enticing option.

I’ve read literally every resource I can find to explain to them why they can’t just sit there and debate whether certain people have the right to live or not, but... nope. They ain’t having it from me. 

Things came to a head yesterday when my brother, who is 6 years younger but 70 lbs heavier than me, shoved me into a wall, FORCEFULLY, when I said something he REALLY didn’t like— which was essentially that men don’t get to decide a woman’s worth and value. (It was part of a larger argument, but for the sake of avoiding a Reddit dogpile I’ll skip the specifics.) That’s normal, right? Brothers shoving their sisters into the wall when they have an opinion they don’t like? That’s definitely normal. For context, he’s never put his hands on me before, and I sure as hell am not about to let any man use violence against me, period. I am not living in a house where that’s okay. He also has access to guns, pocket knives and other weapons my dad keeps in the house, and I no longer feel safe. This is a kid that went into a screaming rage and sat on our front porch with an axe because “rioters were coming to burn down our neighborhood because they hate white people and want us all dead.” Yeah... we’re not even going to unpack that. (We live at the edge of the city and no rioters even came near our neighborhood, btw. Not that I’d have a problem with it or assume they’d start slaughtering people if they did. That’s ridiculous.)

I’m packing my bags tonight, and driving tomorrow evening to stay with a friend 4 hours away, bless him for taking me in. I don’t know what I’m doing from there, I just need out of this house, at least for a couple days. I’ve said in other posts that I’m planning on going back to school in January 2021, I just gotta figure out life out until then. Wish me luck, and if you’re protesting stay safe!

Anyways, these types fo questions always come with the same responses (i.e. drop those ""friends"" they're toxic, go find your real people you'll be better off etc.) but the situation is so much more complicated than that because no matter how shitty they are and how toxic they are and how much it feels meaningless, they are still most of my social interaction. As humans I think we neglect social interaction a lot. People just cut people off when they don't like them etc.

I deeply want to meet the people that will make me feel complete and loved but the space between dropping toxic friends and meeting my people could be forever. I can take a week of being alone but months?, years? Some people never ever find their people.

Maybe it has to do with my perspective as a 19 year old dude in university but sometimes I feel like I'd rather have something shitty than nothing at all. My real life example is snap chat streaks. People always complain about the point of having them if you rarely or don't talk to the person but the reason is because it connects you. It puts you in their mind even if it's only for a second. Someone is thinking about you even if its only for a second. And most people would rather someone thinking about them than no one at all. 

It's a never ending cycle of should I or should I not. I don't really need advice but it's welcome. This is more about venting than anything else. I wish I could just figure everything out. All I've ever wanted was to be stable and settle down and for things to be predictably unpredictable in a good way.

I hope next life exists and is comparable to this one prior to my incarceration, because I had it good. I am exhausted and will not be participating in whatever the fuck I have to live through now, and I urge anyone here to try help before you do drugs or alcohol. 

If you wanna commit crimes instead, well look where it leads to. I'm about to leak my brains out of my skull after two years of loneliness and I'm somehow happier to suicide than I am to exist. Don't go out committing crimes, doing drugs etc just because you hurt inside. The pain is not worth living with. Don't be me please.

I for one feel it's more of a personal choice which generation ""gen-gappers"" chose to identify as.

Most say millennial are 1980-2000, but when you start googling the scientific consensus says 1981–1996 - which makes most of us 20-23 year olds fall into the gen-Z category - which is why I'm creating this poll.

So my question is this; what year were you born and with what generation do you feel your views align with most?

The wife apparently sat down on the couch with the cat and started watching TV the little kid came into the Room looking for the kitten and started crying because she couldn't find it
 The moms thanking the kitten had maybe wandered offer something helped her daughter look for it they couldn't find the cat anywhere and they spent about 2 and a 1/2 hours looking for it
 Until the dad came home from work and when they were all sitting down to dinner the dad starts hearing Kind of weird noises from his wife's side.

His wife is a very large woman still able to move around but with some rather large fat rolls.

 The husband asks his wife what the noises the wife looks at him kind of strangely and says her sides been hurting randomly for the last couple hours so the husband pokes her in the side to see exactly where the pain is coming from and something scratches him.

It was the daughters new kitten the poor little kitten had gotten trapped  Somehow in this lady's fat rope and she hadn't noticed despite some weird pain..

Apparently the dad rushed the little cat to the vet and at least according to that him in the veterinarian from what I heard in the line at the gas station is going to be OK but apparently it has some bruising and what appears to be a couple broken ribs that will require surgery.

So yeah if you're a larger person Maybe make sure your cat doesn't get trapped inside your body fat.. Cause that would be a horrible way to go and a terrible thing to have to explain to your kid I had a hell of a time trying to keep a straight face during that entire 5 minute or so I was in line.

 I kind of feel badd for the little kid and the kitten especially",youngadults,So I had to go into a gas station to pay for my gas and I overheard this and I just tap to post it because I can't not,0.0

I know so many still living with parents and life just revolves around social media. I mean theres 20-25 year olds making tiktoks. I don't see much off a difference between a 19 and 21/22 year old anymore. The music now just revolves around rap/Rnb. I sound like an old folk but tbh I feel as though most of the songs now don't really sound like music or rap at all. Not judging but I feel like I don't fit in. The mentality is very youth teenage like still. Even at college/university crazy how I feel like I'm at high school at times. I haven't really made any proper friends my age. Majority of them I would say are still in the youth phase which is totally fine but I mean still in kinda that late high school phase. One 21 year old who I told my age to even jokily said ''woaah your so old omg''.  Its crazy aha I'm not offended but I don't think I can even date anyone younger than 24 anymore lol. I used to see 21/22 as okay now they feel like babies to me lol. 

also im not saying using social media or being young and youthful is bad. ITS NOT. so please don't think I'm attacking anyone. I just think theres a bit of a difference with young adults now mentality wise. Maybe I just don't fit in lol

Essentially, we hypothesized that those who always had good support will generally be more motivated when somebody tells them they can't do something (gotta prove 'em wrong, and you have already have had the support throughout your life to have the confidence that you *can* prove them wrong). In this case, hearing ""you can do it"", is just what they always hear. Doesn't really mean much, it's just words. 

Conversely, those who didn't have a solid support system throughout their life will be more motivated when somebody says they can do something. (I feel the motivating aspect of this one is pretty obvious. Support of others lifts you up, makes you feel like you can do it cause others think you can. Also the added bonus of motivation through not wanting to disappoint others) In this case, being told you can't do it just adds to the pile of times they've been told that or have thought it. 

Don't have to share how good you think your support has been throughout your life, but I'd be curious to know. 

Of course this is all based on literally nothing. It's just our personal thoughts and experiences that seem to hint at this.

Not to mention, I have never been catcalled or approached in public by men so basically I’ve always know I’m not attractive despite the fact that I keep up my appearance. It’s just my genetics. There’s not much I can do about it. 

During this whole quarantine, I’ve become less self conscious and more okay with the way I look. I’m on tinder, and usually people are pretty nice and it’s just a lot of small talk. Nothing ever becomes of it, and that’s okay. 

That was until I matched with this one guy. His first message to me was that I looked like an even uglier version of Deb from Napoleon Dynamite/the actress Tina Majorino. I’ve heard that one before, and it always hurts. I myself don’t see the resemblance because I have dark hair and have a totally different eye shape, but I guess I look close enough to her for people to make that connection. This guy continued by saying he only matched me to make me aware of that and that it wasn’t meant in a cute way. 

Since then I’ve been crying a lot and seriously considering saving up my money and getting plastic surgery. I didn’t ask to be born like this, but apparently it’s bad enough to warrant people making fun of me. I have since disabled my tinder account and have started questioning my own worth.

Because of this I had some bald spots so my mom took me to a barber to have him help cover them up. They’ve healed up now and I don’t really do it to my hair anymore but I know that my mom knew I did it back then. After that I started tearing off small pieces of napkins and toilet paper and I roll them up into very small balls. It’s a little gross but I would even do the same thing to my leg hair. I’m a freshman in college now and I still haven’t been able to stop. I can go periods of time without it but I still do it daily basically without even knowing. I won’t really even realize it and the next thing I know I am doing it. What would cause this? I think that I have some anxiety but would that cause this? Sometimes I think maybe adhd or autism but i’m pretty sure I have neither of those. Sometimes I even do it in public like in the cafeteria a college or at my friends house but it is basically automatic at this point. I try my best to be desecrate about it but sometimes I worry that other people have seen me doing it.

I was sweating hard and kept not moving for about 3 minutes when I was able to do something. I didn't kill it because it was on the ceiling so it stood there until today. It turned out to be a mama spider because I saw couple little black dots running next to it so yeah, time to burn the house. Anyway, today I was watching youtube exploration videos when something told me to look behind me on the ceiling and of course the spider disappeared. My body again took the defensive not moving mode and eyes started looking for the spider and again it was next to the monitor and just like day before, I couldn't move a muscle.

So Yesterday we got home with my Mother and she was in the house with her friends and she hadn’t cooked as she was instructed too at like 4:00pm and the dishes weren’t done. It wasn’t as much as an issue until she staggered on her way to take a glass of water and her friends were trying to help her sober up in the HOUSE while my mum was watching. 2 friends in this whole story. 

Long story short My Dad came home later and found her in bed puked all over and it became really bad to the point it got physical. She still thinks it’s just common mistakes and that we drink too.

My Dad has asked me us to talk to her which I have done for the longest time. She’s been in worse situations which me and my older brother have gotten her out of without my parents knowing and we’ve been talking to her since.

Fear is a very interesting and complex thing. It’s can be very helpful, healthy, and it is also able to be absolutely crippling. Now when I say fear is helpful and a useful I mean that it is only if we as an Individual learn when to listen to it and when to not. We shouldn’t let fear rule our lives and keep us from living our best life. Sometimes it will be necessary to listen to fear as it will allow you to continue living a life. It’s important to respect it and understand that no matter who you are you have fear.  Sometimes fear will overtake us and when that happens it’s important to have a close group of friends who you trust with your life, those who will always be looking out for your best interests. These are the people who will offer you your most needed counsel in times of challenge and hardship. We all will have our struggles with fear but with the right people behind us it’s always possible to overcome it. For me personally my greatest fear is when I am needed most I will be a coward, and I pray that I will have the strength to persevere.

For my dissertation, I am conducting a research study on the relationship among personality traits, fear of failure, and mental well-being among young adults. 
I would humbly ask you to take out 15-20 minutes of your time to fill out this questionnaire if you are currently between 18 and 25 years of age. Your response will definitely go a long way in helping me complete my dissertation and graduate successfully. If you have any queries about the study, please feel free to reach out to me. Thanks in advance for taking out your precious time to do this!

Basically you need two things to have a life that is “together” and make you be on equal footing as the other people who are your age instead of feeling like you are behind and playing catch up. The two things you need are a job that pays more than minimum wage, and a sex life. If you have those two things then you are caught up to everybody and your life is together. You aren’t playing catch up because you are already caught up. 

So for the job part you just need to have a degree in a useful field, if you already have that then you are already caught up in the job part. If you don’t have that then go back to college, once you are enrolled into a major that is useful then that is good enough you don’t even need the degree yet to feel like you are caught up as long as you are atleast enrolled and working towards it then that’s good enough as long as you don’t drop out and actually get the degree in the end. Next is sex life. Go and hit on people that you are attracted to in your college, outside, and at bars and clubs, and hopefully you will attract someone. There you have it, basically enroll in college into a useful degree, and hit on people that you are attracted to. Do this then the problem of feeling behind and needing to catch up will go away because you are already caught up.",youngadults,Guide on how to get your life together in your 20’s,0.0

Hi dear lovely redditor, this post is for you. I know you are struggling with your life, have no one that understands you or that loves you. I know that you never dated someone and want to be loved and cared. I know that most of your friends have someone in their life and you are here killing your time with memes and stuff. I know that you feel lonely and angry sometimes and want to d1e.

But hear me out, I am going to say you something, what you are feeling is completely normal. Because you are a special person, you deeply care about your and others' feelings and you have powerful feelings. You want best for everyone. You don't want to hurt anyone. And because of these things, you are having problems with meeting new people, you are afraid of doing something wrong. You think that you are the only one. 

But, actually, no. No, you are not the only one. You are just another one percent. There is 1 person like you for every 100 people. Hence, you are struggling to find that 1 person in your social group, because he/she is you. That's also why you are here, because we are just like you, the one percent. You share your feelings with us to relief a little, to be happy a little. We love you, you are beautiful. We like talking with you, listening to you. Do not feel sad or lonely, we are here for you.

Realize that it is possible to find someone like you, someone that would love you, care about you. But keep in mind that it may be hard to find that someone, remember that we are the one percent. Also keep in mind that the one you found may not be the best for you. Don't feel obligated to be with that someone just because he/she is also an one percent. Remember that you can always find another one percent. Please just be patient. Life will guide you.

Keep living, keep exploring, keep learning. Keep being yourself, keep being happy with being yourself. Keep being open about yourself, keep not being afraid who you are. Keep caring about others, keep meeting with others. Keep showing your interests to others, keep sharing your thoughts and ideas with others. And then, sure life will guide you. 

Remember, I love you.

My family is pretty fucked up- my dad is a narcissist/has horrible anger issues but he is also the bread winner as my mom is a stay at home nice so I'm nice even though I would love to vocalize how I feel.   Around two years my dad retired and at that time (when I was 18/19), my mom found out that he cheated on her. During that entire time period, my sister, me, my aunt we were all there for her when she would be in her bed crying and not knowing what to do in terms of the relationship. Well flash-forward and my mom drastically changed. She began spending so much time with my dad and basically ditching my sister and I- leaving us responsible to care for the house. More recently, they travel back and forth to Florida, which leaves my sister having to care for the house.   Her own sisters stopped talking to her for two years because of how much she changed and now they have on and off conversations, but it's nothing compared to the past. My mom is so weirdly obsessed with my dad that she just dropped us all-who were all there for her during this time The way that my sister and I get treated is so much different from two years ago.Like- okay- my mom was constantly there for my sister and I, but then once their relationship was rekindled- things drastically changed . Like now I have to SCHEDULE TIME to be with my own mom because she is so weirdly obsessed with my dad. Like I understand wanting to spend time with your husband, but it's not right for my sister and I to feel like in order to spend time with her, we have to schedule a literal appointment to be with her.

I understand that I am older now, but it hurts when you see your own parent drastically change for the worst.  And whenever I vocalize how I feel and how things are wrong- I get told ""Calm down"", ""Leave me alone"", ""You are older now, I can do what I want"", ""Don't you dare talk to me like that"", ""You better stop being ungrateful"", ""I'm very disappointed in your behavior"" and ""Stop it. I do a lot for you, I'm not going to be around all the time"" and just gets overly defensive when I vocalize how I feel, which then leaves me silent even though what is happening is wrong and my sister feels the same way (the only difference is  that she is slightly older than me/has her license so she is at least able to go places, unlike me). She just gets angry when I vocalize how I feel. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, I am 21 years old- I get that I should start being more independent, but at the same time, I don't think that I should have to feel like I have to schedule time to be with my own parent. And you can be close with your husband and still spend time with your own children, instead of always rushing to ditch us for him.

\-What I am good at

\-What the world needs

\-What I can get paid for

&amp;#x200B;

Around a week ago i reacted on an IG post from a girl i had never met in real life. We only followed eachother because we have a mutual friend. Nothing special about the comment, but she slid into my DMs. We started talking and soon she asked my phone number. We talked for hours in Whatsapp almost every night. I asked her out and we did. last wednesday i picked her up, we went to a little farmer who sells homemade ice cream and we ate it watching the sunset from the dunes at sea. Everything was great. Next day i try and spark a conversation. It was short, so i figured she was busy. no problem. Now. today i was doing a mindless but not so easy job on our farm on the tractor where i dont do  alot  but when i do something i must be done perfectly. so i spent the entire day watching youtube and listening to music on my phone. I decided to message this girl to see what shes up to. she responded that she was just about to message me. So i am kinda exited because thats a good sign right? turned out to be a short conversation as well. me being a bit quick to draw conclusions (because of previous experiences) thinks she may not be that interested suddenly. Now comes the weird part. She suddenly texts me ""wanna make that floppy disc a hard drive?"". It seemed kinda off but i played along. we text like that for a bit. i was very confused and reluctant so at some point i asked what she wanted from me and where this suddenly came from. Then she cassualy mentioned THEY were discussing pickup lines. Turns out she told her friends about me and to quote her ""they were very impressed"" which was quite flattering but what the actual fuck. Her they were sexy messaging me as a group! they even video called me after i asked her to stop this. I onnly saw girls i didnt know giggling. This is why i feel betrayed and humiliated.

 Now tell me.  am i overreacting or something? am i too sensitive? or would you agree with me? 

She appologised multiple times when i told her how i felt. and she wants to talk tonight. I really like this girl and she knows that because i told her. I am pretty shure she feels the same. What the heck should i do? talk to her about my feeling and get over it?

He blocked me shortly after that, and I, in a moment of bad judgement, used my old phone to tell him goodbye and that if he ever needed a friend I was still there for him. Long story short, both him and the girlfriend got very angry with me over the text saying that I was ruining their relationship and that they didn’t know why I was texting him. Both parties texted me and chewed me out over the text. In the end, he told me to *fuck off*. Not in those exact words, no, he told me to have a nice rest of my life. Signed. Sealed. Delivered.

According to another friend, the girlfriend likely didn’t even tell him to block me and he had a track record of isolating himself and blaming the girlfriend as a manipulation tactic. This may be true as it had struck me as odd that this was the second time a girlfriend demanded he block me and demanded our friendship end. 

Yesterday, his Insta popped up in my *suggested*, and it’s taken all my strength not to click follow as I know it will only make him mad at me and ruin any shred of hope that is left of us ever rekindling our friendship. Maybe someday I’ll do it, just to see if he blocks me or freaks out, but I know that that day isn’t today nor will it be tomorrow. 

I do miss him a ton, and I miss our dumb little jokes. It’s incredibly sad to me that then end came because another girlfriend supposedly doesn’t trust him around me and that I may have sealed that fate with my totally platonic heartfelt goodbye message. I always thought he cared about me and that I was important to him, but I guess that was not the case. It’s always tragic to find out that someone your close to didn’t see you as as much of a friend as you saw them.

Everyone says that they’re young and that they won’t last, but I’ve seen people get married at this age and I wouldn’t put it past them to do the same. I honestly don’t believe he will ever speak to me again nor want to be my friend again. I hate how everyone says *have patience* or *there will be a million more friends that will come and go in your life*.

    I've been going through some shit. My job and Covid-19 hasn't helped either. Long story short, my wife and I are 1500 miles apart and our relationship is coming to and end. Typical LDR, yadda yadda. Anyways, over the past month or so I've been trying to just end it all. Thinking over and over again if it was the right thing to do. I just want the pain to end once and for all. 

    This last week has been the worst. All realizations came crashing down at once. I felt like nothing and I felt like I had no future. I've had so very many people do their best to help me and let me know it's not the end of the world. Though it was only temporary. I felt happy when I was with them but due to conflicting schedules, I felt like we could never have a heart to heart when I truly needed it. 

    After a long night of fighting and the eventual blocking on all social media on my SO's part, I felt done. So I was contemplating suicide much more than ever before. My local gun store opens right after my shift so I thought, why not? Had some liquid courage and stayed adamant on my decision. I then realized I haven't had a wank in 8 days so I thought ""one more time"". Right before then, I was still planning on driving to the gun store to pick up a .45 acp or 9mm pistol. After the deed was done, I felt a million pounds lighter. I could see the world in color. All the shit still remains but I'm more positive about it now.

There are so many things I'd like to do during my life, here's just a few:

Travel the world

Build my own house

Improve my drawing skills

Make youtube videos for fun

Living in a schoolbus that I'd convert to a motorhome

Start my own school where everything is centered around creating stuff

Most of these are very ambitious ideas and most of them are probably never going to happen. This makes me sort of sad because I know that I could do most of these things individually if it were the only thing I would focus on.

The people that I *have* talked to about this basically told me to just wait and see what *lies on my path.* To me, that sounds a bit lazy to be honest, I think I should put effort into things I want to accomplish.

So on one side there is too much to do in a lifetime and on the other side I don't want to sit on my butt and just wait and see what is going to happen. That means that I'll have to choose what plans I wanna let go and I don't know what to do because I don't like giving up on stuff before even trying it.

So here I am, spending my days working from home, skating in between and watching Netflix at night. It feels like I'm watching my own life from the sideline. When I lay in bed I often think about it and it honestly makes me feel sad and powerless, but I don't know what to do about it.

I’ve also put my foot in my mouth a couple times, where I responded to one when they were talking to the other.

We went out late last night and basically walked around the whole campus. It was around 11 and they were playing avengers in one of the halls, and one of my roommates tells us “wake me up when you guys are ready to go”. I didnt wanna watch the movie, and everyone else was on their phones, so im thinkin “why the fuck am I here? Im tired as hell.” I lean over to the awake roommate and tell him im going back to our dorm.

Cut to today and I wake up super early. I guess I just couldnt sleep. Anyways I go to take a shower and make a shit ton of little noises here and there, which could have made them mad. I asked them abt it later and they said it was fine and they went back to bed. Eventually I got dressed and walked around campus for awhile.

Then I realize that i dont actually have that much clothes, so i end up driving back home to get more.  This turns into a nearly 4 hour ordeal, with empty train stations and nearly broken mirrors. All kinds of crazy stuff. It was kinda fun. They end up spending the whole day together, most likely.

I come back w my shit and they dont even notice me nor say hi. I had headphones in but im pretty sure I would have heard them. Their both somewhat loud.

Well the brownies we bought were hella strong. Like 10g in a brownie. The dude told us to eat at max half of the brownie at a time. Well, during our first night I was kinda drunk since we’d been drinking, so my dumbass decided to eat an entire brownie. I’ve very little experience with weed, so I hadn’t a clue what was coming. Well, fast forward about half an hour later I was BLASTED. Could barely walk straight. I felt like I kept popping in and out of existence. So, I decided I needed to go lie down and go to sleep. I climbed the stairs like a robot, having to put a lot of effort into actually moving my muscles. Got to my bed, laid down and passed out. I woke up about an hour later, noticing A LOT of anxiety. Still high as a fucking kite may I remind you. My mind was racing. The thought of myself catching fire popped into my mind, so I sat up. (I forgot to mention I had a roommate and he was in a twin bed next to me) inside my head, I was freaking out. My bones were starting to feel like they were being stabbed with needles. Everywhere. I was seeing green and red squigglys. So, my entire nervous system felt like it was just burning. I woke my roommate up in a panic and told him to “tell me everything’s okay man. Just tell me I’m okay. Tell me everything’s going to be okay” I just needed somebody to comfort me because I was losing it. I needed to calm down. So, he told me to just lie back down and try to go back to sleep. So, I did. Next morning I wake up, every muscle in my body sore as fuck. It was like I had worked out intensely the day before for the first time ever. 

So that was the day I tripped balls and had a panic attack on weed. My thoughts are there must’ve been something else in the brownies, or my brain just went into some kinda stimulation overload.",youngadults,I went to Colorado and ate a 10g weed brownie and my nervous system caught fire.,0.0

Wednesday I had a first date from Tinder! She was really cool and was from Brazil and is here for the Au Pair program. We got dinner and talked for 2+hours before she said she had to go. She isn't responding to my texts but I don't really care. And least she didn't cancel on me like my previous attempt on setting up a tinder date lmao

Yesterday I went to a local dive bar and played guitar (I'm pretty well known around the local music scene where I live) and some lady came up to sing and she shook her ass up on me while I was playing so that was a little weird(especially considering my mom was there and saw everything). Tbh I'm more or less used to people touching my arms/shoulders/face randomly but if they ask for contact info I give them fake names sometimes. Also had to play with this terrible drummer. Tried telling him he needs to play more quiet bc I couldn't hear the other instruments and he got pissed and yelled at me and stormed out. Everyone told me later he was a total douchebag lol

And today I got my wisdom teeth out! All four of them. I have the worst luck with dental history in that I've had to get teeth surgically removed before, have had seven extractions, a root canal, and I half of one of my front teeth is fake from smashing my head into a bowling pin (long story).

In psychology, this stage of asserted individuality is deemed normal for young adults. It's a component of growing up, that we examine what our parents and other family members taught us, and decide whether we still desire to adhere to it, or if we want to develop our own values and beliefs. 

For the sake of not being overly vague, I will provide a few examples of this phenomenon in my life. 

1. I have renounced Christianity.
2. I quit voting. 
3. I have embraced veganism.
4. I am pursuing self-employment (blogging). 

All of these things are not supported by my parents, or the rest of my family. (The ones I have opened up to, anyways.) As a result, I feel somewhat ostracized from my family. I still love my parents, don't get me wrong, but when my dad mockingly labels me the ""black sheep"" of the family, among other things, it gets increasingly difficult to stay respectful and/or open-minded.  

As a result of all this, I have never wished for a girlfriend more than I do right now. That sounds childishly desperate, but I feel like I have no support in life. I'm not asking that my family convert to my way of thinking; just that they don't constantly make known their acrimony towards my newfound ideals and beliefs. I do have a counselor I see every two weeks, and I still believe in God, so prayer has been helpful as well. Still, I feel afraid to stand by my convictions; instead I hide my true feelings, and just go along with whatever my relative is saying. 

I get that a lot of people who feel alone/unsupported tell themselves they will never find (romantic) love, but it is something I have thought to myself many times. I read some of the great things redditors on this subreddit, and others, say about their relationships, and how great it is to have someone to confide in and adventure with, and I feel really left out.

Backstory: I had my Russian Final today(summer semester) as I am walking back to my dorm. I start hearing a girl say things like “I can take it from here” and “ It really not that heavy , I can take it from here.” As I get closer I see one of the girls from my building trying to get her suitcase back from a guy that keeps trying to walk toward the parking lot with it . He keep saying a version of “ No , let me help , a girl should have to carry this stuff. I can do it for you.” At this point I don’t know if this guy is just trying the help her out or not but it seems a little sketchy to me and the girl looks a little stress and uncomfortable. So I have no Idea what her name is but. As I get closer to her, I get a weird feeling. So I pretend I know her. I called out Hey babe there you are I’ve been looking for you. And I go up and put my arm around her. The girl recognizes me enough to not freak, and she just kind of hugs me back and says hey babe back. The guy looks kind of scared, I’m a big guy about 6’5. So I just look at him and ask if he was helping her move her stuff, he says yeah and looks kind of twitchy . I say thanks man ,I got it from here. I take the suit case from him and I walk with the girl to the parking lot to make sure he doesn’t follow her. When we hit the parking lot I gave her back the case and apologized If I read the situation wrong but she looked nervous . She thanks me for helping her out and I ask if that’s that last of her stuff and if she wants we to walk her back to the dorm. She says that the last of it. She hugs me says thanks for helping get rid of the creep gets in her car and goes. I have no idea if I did the right thing in this situation.

Technically, he called it a “break” but it’s still shitty and I’m still upset either way. So I tried to dress cute to make myself feel better and for the most part it worked.

So that was cool. Then I had to drive back to my apartment in the rain. It was awful. I hate driving in the rain. It was like the rain was shaking my entire car. I was tense and anxious the entire two hour drive.

Then once I’m at my apartment I have to drive to class. Thats all fine and dandy. Campus parking is a bitch, but I found a space. Kind of. Apparently it wasn’t a space and I got a ticket. I only parked there because a bunch of other people were parked there too. At least I wasn’t the only one to get a parking ticket.

Next, I had public speaking which I just fucking hate. It’s required, so there’s no way out of it. I have horrible social anxiety. I know everyone does to some extent, but I take medication and it’s still sometimes crippling.

Our assignment was to get to know someone in class well enough to write a introductory speech on them. My partner was nice, but I’m just awkward and it’s like just let me die p l e a s e.

Then on the way back to my apartment, my fucking rear view mirror broke off. I have no fucking clue what I hit. It was too busy to stop, but now my mirror is cracked and bent and all fucky and I feel like shit because my parents just got me a new phone because mine broke. I split it with them, but it was still a big chunk of money.

Now I have this fucking mirror which I don’t want to make them pay for. I love my parents so much. They do a lot for me. They pay for mostly everything and I’m trying so hard not to take that for granted. 

But now it’s like tuition, phone, and now this fucking mirror. Is it illegal to drive with one rear view mirror? I dunno. I just feel bad having such large expenses all at the same time.

So, I’ve been watching this show while getting a bit tipsy with a little group I met during orientation. It’s been a nice change of pace and all, as it’s nice to experience different types of fun, and in a way, I enjoy their company and the show can be somewhat entertaining when you take it at surface-level (especially just to see how things end, to be honest)

On the other hand, I feel like the writing demonizes a lot of vices/habits that I partake in and depicts things without much nuance, to be honest.

Besides the obvious ones like teenagers getting into all this dramatic shit and somehow outsmarting a police investigation.

**Steroids**

I take anabolic steroids. It actually has very little effect on my personality (other than higher libido). It really doesn’t make you aggressive or whatever as long as you control your estrogen (since testosterone aromatizes), and the estrogen is what usually causes mood swings. With controlled E2, you just feel a bit more robotic and less tolerance for pointless stuff (I zone out on unimportant stuff more often). You will also speak your mind more often, ime.

And the fact that they portray this skinny ass kid to be taking it and fucking up his whole HPTA with zero bodybuilding experience is such a bad precedent to set. I started using after competing in men’s physique and 4 years of serious lifting (5 yrs total) with the goal to move to classic physique using the extra mass that I put on with AAS. He’s paying $100 per vial too, which I won’t even get into lol.

**Escorts**

I’ve been seeing escorts for 1.5 years on and off now (in between girlfriends, at the same time as more casual hookups). They screen for guys exactly like Bryce. The professional ones would never touch a guy who went to trial for so many rapes. I think it’s not usually for guys in situations like Bryce or Alex, but rather for guys who don’t have the time/effort to put into a relationship (usually too busy with work). I also like escorts because they’re very good at what they do, and make girls my age pale in comparison. They’re generally also good conversationalists and are interesting to talk to after/before fucking. Sometimes, I don’t feel the same way about other girls that I get with.

**Activism**

What the fuck was that all about? That was the most surface-level pop feminism. I don’t think any sane person would ever protest a person’s funeral. There was no depth to that discussion and it felt really out of touch. I suppose it may have been a satirical commentary on some more radical feminism, but that makes up for a very small minority of feminists, whereas in this show, the minority was the non-radical individuals who were critical of the funeral protest (read: Jessica, Bolan, Ani, Tyler). I suppose it could be a commentary on hivemind/groupthink stemming from a few radical individuals (in this case, one particularly radical individual), but for some reason, I doubt it.

**What does 13 Reasons get right?**

I think they did get a few things right. 

I can’t speak from experience, but one of my best friends had to get an abortion once. She said that there were pro-life protestors at the clinic and that her boyfriend had to get aggressive with them in order to prevent them from harassing her. I think their depiction of the challenge of getting an abortion was pretty accurate.

We’re only on the fifth episode, but so far, they’ve depicted drugs and alcohol very well. Alcohol lowers your inhibitions, make you stumble and slur, etc obviously. I’ve only done it a handful of times, but Coke is not some insane drug like some other shows or movies may depict it to be. It’s just a giant dopamine hit, and when it’s finished, it feels like a Christmas morning 

I think they did a decent job depicting immigration issues. I don’t know if ICE shows up at the doorstep, but I know that immigration issues cost tens of thousands in legal fees. People often skip town if they are in jeopardy of deportation, particularly once they receive immigration notices. Perhaps ICE’s methods have become more aggressive in the past 10 years (I have no experience w it since then), but I’m not educated enough on the subject to comment on that.

Tl;dr: they depicted a lot of things inaccurately and a few issues accurately, but all in all, it’s a pretty awful show (it feels like i’m consuming the junk food of TV, akin to reality tv or something)... i’m v excited to move on and check out the next season of Mindhunter though, i really enjoyed the first season.

**Discussion:** I’d love to hear y’alls thoughts on the show, especially if you feel like anything (vices, mental issues, social life) was depicted accurately or inaccurately. 

I just can’t voice my concerns about the depiction of stuff like steroids and escorts to the people around me anymore without the risk of being ostracized to a degree, so it’s nice to do it on this subreddit where things are anonymous.

I always found something magical about romanticism. Climbing a girl's windows, singing Italian songs, chocolates, kissing in the rain etc. There is something deeply attractive about this.

Do you believe that we are losing some of this romanticism in favor of more post-modern dating methods? And I am not here to judge or tell others what they should do, by the way. I am just asking a question.

Would you agree that some of the more classical ideas about romanticism are being lost in favor of more relaxed view on sex? A lot of people already do not even like the idea of ""the one"" or ""love at first sight"" etc. just to name a few examples.

So yes. Please, share your opinions.

My roommate and I have a shared Spotify playlist and the songs that were the soundtrack to the end of my summer are now the soundtrack to our late night spikeball and frisbee games. Honestly would recommend this to everyone in college.

I still have to see what classes will be like but I'm so glad I'm here. I was worried coming in if I chose the right school or if I would be able to form meaningful connections with other people but now I'm convinced that this is the right place for me. I guess that's why I'm making this post - partially to share my excitement, but also to ease others' concerns since I know not everyone has moved in yet.

I'm still slightly out of practice and whenever I practice my mom yells and insults me so I don't like driving with her anyway.

Now I'm going to college in an area where a car is a hassle and my mom doesn't want to pay car insurance when I'll rarely ever use her car. I have no desire to own a car but do want a license.

I played everything from shooters to MOBAs, kept up with the eSports scene and everything. But as I got older, and got more stressed out in real life, I tended to gravitate towards games that were more fun than competitive.

Things like card games, or PvE games like Diablo 3, Warframe, etc. where I could just have some fun without worrying about people shouting at me for ""being bad"".

I still play the occasional competitive game, but I'd rather spend an hour playing Rocket League or Minecraft with friends than getting mad trying to grind Rainbow 6 solo queue.

We had a ""friend break up"" a few years ago bc she quit sugar and we ran out of weed at about the same time so she was pretty mean... We didn't talk for about a year, then came back together and have had a much better relationship.

Around 6-7 months ago, she broke up with her boyfriend. They were in an open relationship and she had started seeing someone new and he did not like this. He was a huge jerk and directly drove her away and into the arms of this new guy.

Except I can't stand him. He's a leech, he takes energy, money, time, and care and doesn't give her anything. She went thru a loss and went to him for help and he broke up with her on the spot. She blinked out of contact for a few days, and when she popped back up, they were out of state together.

He's already not my favorite person, but they kept breaking up and getting back together. She had me come over one day bc he attacked her; she had to go to the police. I found out she lied about other fights, and he has hit her twice before.

I remember her specifically telling me, ""I'm not going to wait around for him to become a girlfriend beater,"" and I told her he already is bc he had beaten his last girlfriend.... I didn't know he had already hit her.

She put her foot down and didn't talk to him for about two weeks, then limited contact for a while.

She and I were trying to start a small business together and we talk every day, so I know when she is talking to him or not. I saw condoms in her room after they started hanging out again and kind of shut her off for a couple days, but then his dad died unexpectedly and she has barely left his side.

I know now that our business is a bust, and that I need to cut ties with her, but I can't do it. She's the only person I hang out with as my other friend isn't stateside.... She also suffered a loss of a pet, days after his dad passed, and I am trying my best to be there for her.

She is still working on the business (I am too but I don't plan on continuing with her or her strategies), and I need to tell her sooner than later that it won't be happening. I have tried to tell her that I want our business to be separate from our friendship and the line was blurred immediately.

I already don't tell her much about myself and don't give her advice or thoughts, but she doesn't notice bc all she talks about is that guy or the business.

I think I am actually a shy extrovert and that my previous thoughts were tangled up with mental health issues. My shyness is something thats weird because no one would call me shy. All of my friends think I'm so outgoing and I think thats due to how they met me. At the  beginning of school or camp when no one knows anyone I am not shy because everyone else is just as awkward and I think that puts me in a hole because I meet and talk to a tonne of people and come off as super outgoing but in reality I have to hype myself up to ask a worker for something or to call a restaurant. I think this adds to my mental health issues because now I ""have"" to live up to what they met me as. And it's just a cycle of being tired of being someone else. This is where the introvert/extrovert ideas are so hard to understand for me (not that I find the need to define myself by these, its just that I find it helps me know who I am) because all those hours I spent alone in my dorm room watching tv and lying in my bed I thought was me being an introvert but maybe its more linked to my (undiagnosed) depression (I think this because lots of alone time, hard to wake up, hard to do things that I like, hard to take care of myself like shower and brush my teeth, suicidal thoughts). And now that I kind of realized maybe I'm not an introvert and that I'm just a sad, shy extrovert is something that makes me feel better about my life. Because maybe all my problems can be blamed on my head. When I want to drop out of school and when I hate doing everything and I just want to sleep all day and I want to disappear maybe I can blame it all on that. But I don't know what to do. I might fail all my classes this term anyways and I'm a big mess. Hope everyone else is doing better and living life to the fullest.

I am really trying to better myself and become more humble. I am a sophomore in college. I have a long history of being bullied in highschool which has caused me to have insecurity issues. I really did not have any real friends until my senior year. I also have auditory processing Disorder and honestly probably ADHD as well. This means that socializing, especially in groups, is just that much harder for me. I have been a lot more confident in myself to where I do put self out there in terms of talking to new people but I am still overall really socially awkward.

Over the past 2 years I would say now I have become increasingly more braggy. I feel the need to come across as this smart and person who has friends. I recently joined a fraternity, where the people are all generally nice guys but I really havent made any real friends. Once again I feel like an outsider. In my head though I think of ways I can come across as smarter and better than them in ways. I even do this with my close friends. Also on social media. I have become increasingly obsessive with how many followers and likes I have.

One other thing I do and am ashamed of that I do is that I think about things to brag about before I go hangout with people. It might be a suddal brag about my GPA or something like that.

Boy was I wrong. The reality of my choice finally hit me, and after seeing my friends re-uniting at school, and seeing all of them going out to play their senior year of football, I've become really depressed and lonely. I know it sounds stupid, but I feel so depressed that this was my last chance ever to play football organized football, and I'll never get that opportunity again; I'll never get my senior poster, I'll never get my senior pictures, I'll never get a chance to do all the traditions that I've been looking forward too for years, I'll never get the chance to enjoy hanging-out with my friends during our last year together.

And the worst part is I feel like I missed out on all of this for no reason. As time goes on, it seems like things are getting safer and safer, and I was stupid for choosing not to do something so important to me. I understand that people have things a lot worse right now and I'm trying to remember that, but that doesn't make me feel any less depressed. Like I said, it's really just gotten to the point where I've lost the motivation to due anything, including getting ready for college. By sheer will I've been forcing myself to get things done, but I'm honestly not sure how much longer that's gonna work.

Not sure what I'm looking for. Maybe just to vent, or maybe some advice on how to make peace with my decision, cause it's too late to change it, and I gotta stick with now.

I have three sons (21, 19, 13).  All are great and I love them to bits. I am wondering what to do for the 19 year old.

He’s very creative, very kind, and is in his first year of community college (we saved to pay for it so he doesn’t have to have a loan).  He’s kind of lost on what to do though.  He graduated from a STEM high school, had an internship with Northrup Grumman doing programming but didn’t like it.  He wants to do music production and has built up a following, has contacts and is passionate about it.

I know he really doesn’t want to go to college but he chose to study business as it’s generic enough to go in many directions. I also told him he needs to either pay rent to live at home ($300 a month) or go to school.  He chose school bc he knows he needs some sort of education outside of high school, and he’s free to choose whatever he wants.  All I want is for him to have a way to make a living beyond working fast food. 

We’re at the end of his first semester and he’s really tried.  He’s worked hard at school but is reluctant to sign up for the next semester.  I told him to take a break and just pay rent while he figures things out but he doesn’t want to do that either.  I suspect what he really wants is to live here, work his minimum pay job (not a critique just a fact) and focus on music production. Honestly, he’s very good and although I don’t know much about it, what I hear him doing is amazing.

My question is: would any of you, as young adults trying to figure things out, have appreciated being able to have a year or so to pursue your passion and see if it works out while not worrying about paying rent (he does pay his own car insurance, phone bills, contributes to food, etc) or would that get you off track for the future?  My worry is if it goes on too long and he’s no longer a student, then we get to a point where I can’t carry him on my health insurance.  That’s a huge concern as a parent for me. 

I want him to be happy and will support whatever he wants to do.  So what are your thoughts?  Have him take fewer classes so college isn’t dropped entirely which frees up time for him to pursue his passion?  Let him have a break from school and not pay rent?  Stick to the original plan of either college and no rent or pursue passion and pay rent?

It was something I always told my best friend, before he passed away in July. I still say it comedically, but not without my heart aching. These colder months, rainy days, and sleep deprived nights are taking a toll on me. 

I'm sad and all I can do is grieve and keep pushing. Stay focused. Consistent. It is what he would have wanted. It is what he asked of me. It is what he made me promise him. Just for the time though, 
I would like to lament.

If I knew necromancy, I would do it. No questions asked. I don't care how many horror movies I have seen. If I could speak to the dead, I would do it. Even if it brought demons with it. If I knew I knew dying today meant I could be with him again, I would do it. Yet I don't know that. I don't know what is on the other side and that scares me.

Life is so short and unexpected. Unforgiving, even. I suppose this is my way of mourning. I just wanted to say that I appreciated every month, minute, and moment we had spent together. For he brought out the best in me. A part of me I'd never seen. I value the times we hung out. There isn't a day that goes by that he does not cross my mind. So I will cherish that the fact that he reminded me of who I truly was and I will forever and always be grateful.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. My religious standpoint wavers at times, but I hope and pray he is somewhere without pain and turmoil. That he is in true bliss and happiness.

Before anyone contacts me about this, I wanted an outlet to write with out worrying friends and family. I know it takes about two years to mourn a death. Although the intensity of one's feelings may lessen over time, there is no timetable for how long a person will grieve. The length of time is different for each person. For most people it is a long process and it can take years. I just know that I am sad and it will take time. I am giving you guys the raw form of myself that I have been for over the past five months. I'm tired. One of the people I had in my life that made me happy was taken away tragically.

So i'm finishing up my senior year and graduating in may 2021, I have a question for those of you who recently moved out too as I'm kind of bad with personal financing and budgeting. My college was completely on campus housing and so mostly everything was provided - I never had to worry about renting apartments/signing leases/finding roommates etc.

&amp;#x200B;

1. When you moved out of your house (whether for undergrad or grad school) into your own apartment - did you move the furniture you already had from your house or simply buy new furniture? I live about 3 hours out from where I will be moving so I don't know which would be better. I figure movers would be a hassle/expensive. Do you guys recommend buying or renting furniture? I'm just not really sure how much expenses wise I should be spending here.
2. What would you say is a typical rent for someone who recently graduated making maybe 30-40k? I have set it at $800 per person (so setting my max rent to $1600 monthly if I have a roommate) - Is this low? High? Reasonable? 
3. How did you guys find roommates? I don't know that many people moving where I am moving so I was just curious on if there were any resources for that.

I think there is a stage in life after 40 years called ""generativity vs stagnation"" according to Erikson's theory of psychosocial development , your focus is gonna be whether you made your life count in terms of achievements. I think I'm already at that stage.

I'm glad  I'm out but now there's so much uncertainty and I really like the location of my apartment. and my bedroom in general. I have a final comp sci assignment and a linear algebra assignment due tomorrow at 23:59 and I don't want to do either. Finals starts shortly after that. I think I'm finally over my ex. I have lovely girlfriend and she's really good for me and even though she ticks off all the right boxes she's not a Christian so I know she can't be the one. I'm building a super dope pc (Ryzen 7 3700x and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070) and I'm buying myself a ps5 next semester so that'll be fun. 

Next semester I'll be 20. I won't be a teenager anymore. Next semester I won't be friends with any of the people that I befriended in first year anymore. Although I have made some really nice friends in second year even with covid.

My instagram has become a photo book of people I am no longer friends with. I've never had a close relationship with my parents or my siblings. I don't have any cousins my age. All my grandparents are dead or I can't communicate with them because of language barriers. 

The people in my life always leave. 

And I know that the people I have right now probably won't last either even though at least it seems like these people won't be the type to hurt me when they leave.

It'll be bad for a while but it gets better.

I'm tired.

I was well adjusted and acclimated to the educational environment that all kids go through. I loved school, so much so that I did college level courses all throughout high school. I recall doing incredible on my examinations and even though I was socially regressed and had a bad at home life, I still managed to excel academically. School was my best friend, because nothing beats an education.

I graduated at 18 with a full ride scholarship and was successful in pursuing a post secondary education. I was thrilled to continue my education while having the privilege to work at a lawful occupation with a schedule that allowed for me to study and pursue classes. I will never forget how much I adored the structural integrity provided to me at such a young age, as it gave me many positive outlets. I loved having the right to bear arms, purchase goods and services, pay my bills such as car insurance and car payments, and drive unobstructed on public roads that were maintained in part with taxes I paid.

However, I made some of the most horrific and detrimental decisions that I’ve ever made in my young life. After my college courses were over I began making the wrong friends. My cousin whom I lived with was dating a convicted felon who was on felony probation, and I was surrounding myself with people such as him and drug users. Overtime, I chose to adapt to the environment consisting of negative activities as opposed to involving myself more with positive role models. I was an adult, and I should’ve known better than to be around the wrong people. 

I wound up committing a multitude of violent theft related felony offenses soon after I turned 19 years old. I thought that I was special and therefor exempt from the laws and social norms that society expects from its citizens. I believed that I wasn’t responsible for abusing illicit controlled substances, and I believed that I didn’t need to address some very prominent mental health related problems by continuing to attend therapy sessions that were provided free of charge by my community college.

At 20 years old, I am a convicted felon. A thief. I no longer have my full ride scholarship, and my academic background has been disregarded and overshadowed by the newly adopted persona of a criminal. I am on a drug offender supervised release program for a period of over 5 years, of which I may not leave the county. My prospective university no longer will allow me to attend classes and they will not confer any type of degree to me. I am no longer a bright, kind, intelligent young man with prospects of obtaining a lucrative career path. I will not have easy access to gainful employment, as I’ve found that even small companies do not want to risk having a convicted thief on their payroll.

At 20 years old, I may never vote again. I may not own or possess a firearm, ammunition or body armor. I may not own or possess any weapon during my supervised release. I may not make new meaningful connections through a post secondary institution, as I cannot go further than the AA degree I’ve earned. I will never get to experience the joys of freedom, all because I abused my freedom to deprive others to their right to own property.

The judge informed me that one of the victims called me a “menace to society.” I am in no position to disagree. A menace is an unwanted cancer on the body of society, one that must be removed and terminated. At just 20 years old, I will be doing the right thing for society. I will be ending my life. I will provide closure for the victims of my thefts by ending my life, as they’ll never have to worry about me potentially reoffending ever again. I will save money for the tax payers and family whom I burdened with legal fees, probation fees, and other fees since I can’t locate gainful employment any longer.

I want this to be a warning to any of you who thinks it pays to be a thief. If you believe that just because you have an education and you’re a white male that you can just violate the law as blatantly as I have, think again. If you think a crime spree or drug use is “fun,” think long and hard about the long lasting ramifications that your actions can AND will have on the lives of others. I want to apologize to my victims, family and friends for my sins. I want to apologize to the police and the state for the extreme cost of investigation, and I’d like to apologize to the school system for investing so much time and effort into a prospect who chose to turn into dangerous liability. 

My suicide symbolizes regret. It symbolizes shame, and it symbolizes punishment. I believe the self imposition of a sentence of death is fair and not cruel or unusual given the circumstance of my crimes.

I was well adjusted and acclimated to the educational environment that all kids go through. I loved school, so much so that I did college level courses all throughout high school. I recall doing incredible on my examinations and even though I was socially regressed and had a bad at home life, I still managed to excel academically. School was my best friend, because nothing beats an education.

I graduated at 18 with a full ride scholarship and was successful in pursuing a post secondary education. I was thrilled to continue my education while having the privilege to work at a lawful occupation with a schedule that allowed for me to study and pursue classes. I will never forget how much I adored the structural integrity provided to me at such a young age, as it gave me many positive outlets. I loved having the right to bear arms, purchase goods and services, pay my bills such as car insurance and car payments, and drive unobstructed on public roads that were maintained in part with taxes I paid.

However, I made some of the most horrific and detrimental decisions that I’ve ever made in my young life. After my college courses were over I began making the wrong friends. My cousin whom I lived with was dating a convicted felon who was on felony probation, and I was surrounding myself with people such as him and drug users. Overtime, I chose to adapt to the environment consisting of negative activities as opposed to involving myself more with positive role models. I was an adult, and I should’ve known better than to be around the wrong people. 

I wound up committing a multitude of violent theft related felony offenses soon after I turned 19 years old. I thought that I was special and therefor exempt from the laws and social norms that society expects from its citizens. I believed that I wasn’t responsible for abusing illicit controlled substances, and I believed that I didn’t need to address some very prominent mental health related problems by continuing to attend therapy sessions that were provided free of charge by my community college.

At 20 years old, I am a convicted felon. A thief. I no longer have my full ride scholarship, and my academic background has been disregarded and overshadowed by the newly adopted persona of a criminal. I am on a drug offender supervised release program for a period of over 5 years, of which I may not leave the county. My prospective university no longer will allow me to attend classes and they will not confer any type of degree to me. I am no longer a bright, kind, intelligent young man with prospects of obtaining a lucrative career path. I will not have easy access to gainful employment, as I’ve found that even small companies do not want to risk having a convicted thief on their payroll.

At 20 years old, I may never vote again. I may not own or possess a firearm, ammunition or body armor. I may not own or possess any weapon during my supervised release. I may not make new meaningful connections through a post secondary institution, as I cannot go further than the AA degree I’ve earned. I will never get to experience the joys of freedom, all because I abused my freedom to deprive others to their right to own property.

The judge informed me that one of the victims called me a “menace to society.” I am in no position to disagree. A menace is an unwanted cancer on the body of society, one that must be removed and terminated. At just 20 years old, I will be doing the right thing for society. I will be ending my life. I will provide closure for the victims of my thefts by ending my life, as they’ll never have to worry about me potentially reoffending ever again. I will save money for the tax payers and family whom I burdened with legal fees, probation fees, and other fees since I can’t locate gainful employment any longer.

I want this to be a warning to any of you who thinks it pays to be a thief. If you believe that just because you have an education and you’re a white male that you can just violate the law as blatantly as I have, think again. If you think a crime spree or drug use is “fun,” think long and hard about the long lasting ramifications that your actions can AND will have on the lives of others. I want to apologize to my victims, family and friends for my sins. I want to apologize to the police and the state for the extreme cost of investigation, and I’d like to apologize to the school system for investing so much time and effort into a prospect who chose to turn into dangerous liability. 

My suicide symbolizes regret. It symbolizes shame, and it symbolizes punishment. I believe the self imposition of a sentence of death is fair and not cruel or unusual given the circumstance of my crimes. Despite nobody being injured, assaulted or otherwise directly involved during the commission of my criminal activities, a homeowner could’ve been fatally injured or otherwise harmed had they come outside during my deviant actions. Because I knowingly and willingly committed these offenses while under the influence of illegal narcotics, I find it improbable and unlikely that my life holds any continued value.

Being anxious is one of the best motivators, in my opinion. As soon as I started taking steps to actually alleviate my anxiety (such as studying when I'm anxious about a class, which is pretty much always) it gets much better. Because of actually doing this, I'm now one of the top students in all my classes. I've always been average or below average, but now I actually work whenever I'm anxious, and it works

There's not a group that's known to be more stressed out than young adults, so there you go. For all you people out there who feel like they're dying in anxiety, I think you can use that to your own advantage if you use that anxiety as a motivator.

So basically, I'm 21F (third year university) and haven't made a single friend there. I pretty much keep to myself on campus, because I just spend my time either in class, walking to class, or studying, I'm not involved in any groups/extracurriculars. 

I've also noticed that I've pretty much outgrown all my friends from highschool. I have one friend since elementary that I know I'll be close with forever, and I cherish her. However, the other ones that I've lost touch with just don't share the same values as I do anymore. I've grown up a little more I think, stopped the partying and drinking every week, spending money on dumb things, going for lunches and dinners, caring about social media stuff, etc etc.

So basically, I know that its normal and healthy to lose touch with old friends as you get older, its just upsetting to me that I haven't made any new friends and I don't see myself doing so anytime soon. I stuggle with this a lot, as it ties in with my depression. Especially when I compare myself to other close-knit friend groups I see online, or even TV shows *Friends* or *That 70's Show.* I know that sounds stupid but its something that I've ALWAYS longed for. To just have a tight-knit GROUP of friends. Not just one person or two people that I am seperately friends with.

I know the answer should be to just ""get out there, join clubs and try new things,"" however even when you do these things, it seems that people these days are just so introverted that they aren't even open to talking to people they don't know.

In fact, I probably talk about it more than I talk about anything (except maybe gaming). 

I was diagnosed at 8 with ADHD and general anxiety disorder. I didn't know this until i was 22 and had always thought i was just a weird person who was destined to feel different and more hyper than everyone. It made me feel like a social pariah and like I wasn't deserving of love. At 19 though, I did come to terms with part of my identity: I was an alcoholic.

I had binge drank, drunk drove, got sent to the hospital, got in blackout fights, and finally after shitting my pants one night after a particularly bad blackout (i drank tobasco sauce in addition to a bottle of grey goose and 10 beers). I decided enough was enough. 3 months later i was in AA and stringing together consistent sobriety. 6 months after that my mom admitted she was an alcoholic and quit with me (she is now 4 and a half years sober).

So why do i share this? who cares? THAT IS MY POINT. People do care. people out there feel the same and work on writing to a reddit forum to hide their identity and talk about these things. Well, I am trying to be more public about my mental illness. I started a website ([www.propositivity.com](https://www.propositivity.com)) and I started streaming to talk to teens and young adults about mental illness. ([Twitch.tv/spidermojo](https://Twitch.tv/spidermojo) a follow is appreciated but not necessary).

I went on anti-depressants at 22 and my life changed for the better. I know that it is not this easy for many, but i want everyone to know i am there for them. If you feel like noone understands you, give me a shot. I will at least do my best to understand and at the VERY LEAST I will hear you and show you you are loved.

We can't all be blessed with money, or health, or happiness, but we sure as hell can try to improve together.

Love all,

At the start, I was trying to keep in touch with all my friends. Most of them stopped replying after about a week. From then I was regularly in touch with about 4 people. Over the last 2 weeks it's come down to 2.

A few of the ones I was talking to at the start have begun messaging again, but that's only to ask me questions about deadlines and exams we have - honestly I feel kinda used - they ask me a question about a test or something and I answer and ask how they're doing and they just say ""Thanks. I'm good :)"", never ask me how I'm doing - like not even a simple ""You?"". Am I just meant to say how I'm doing anyway? The same thing happens when I wish them good luck in an exam. I get a ""Thanks!"" - never a good luck back even though *we have the same exam*. Normally I'll then ask how they're doing, and they just respond with the usual ""I'm good"".


It's not like I pester them every day. It's like once a week at most - only less if they've got more than one exam in a week. At this point I've basically given up. All I want is a couple of people to take the time to ask me how I'm doing, or wish me luck in an exam.

Am I being weird? Like I message people like I would talk to them if I bumped into them *outside* (whats that again). Am I meant to communicate in memes? At one point I tried sending people a no-context GIF of a cute animal and a message saying ""hope you're doing okay"", and the only replies I got were ""lol thank you"".

Idk if I'm overthinking it but I feel like people just don't want to talk to me. And I'm feeling really lonely and my depression is like 90% back - as I'm sure many people are.

Like think of it this way. You can have a small simple intimate wedding without worrying about offending extended family or friends that you feel obligated to invite since there's a restriction on how many people can gather or have enough distance between each other. And since the wedding would be small, the cost of most things would be cheaper as well. That sounds like the dream for someone like me lol. I could also just want a small wedding because my culture has this whole thing about inviting everyone you possible can including people you don't even know (my ethnic background is Indian) as a way for your parents/ grandparents to show off to other families. I just want close family and friends to celebrate and enjoy myself with. I don't think my parents would care too much about this, but I know my extended family especially my grandma would be so offended if I didn't go back to India/have a huge wedding where she gets to choose who she wants to invite. There are so many other things about Indian wedding expectations that I could complain about but I'm going to leave it at that because the initial intention behind this post got lost somewhere in the middle of this paragraph lol. 

Tldr; Pandemic wedding = Best time for small intimate wedding with only close family and friends.

Learn how to push yourself, have adventures! It's good to test your boundaries but always be mindful of your safety.

This study aims to contribute to the limited Australian data regarding problematic juvenile fire setting and analyse the risk factors from a developmental perspective.

Participants will be asked to complete an online questionnaire, consisting of questions aimed at understanding past fire related behaviours and interests (e.g.“*Do you start fires with friends?*”), the quality of family relationships (e.g.“*How often did your parent figure show how, or teach you, to do things that you did not know how to do?*”) and childhood conduct disorder traits (e.g.“*I have broken into someone else’s house, building or car*”).

Following these surveys, there will be a brief online cognitive task (Stroop Word Colour test – accuracy of judging the colour of a word) to measure impulsivity levels.

At the end of the questionnaire, you will be asked for your email if you would like to enter a draw to win 1 of 4 $25 egift vouchers. Winners will be drawn randomly at the end of the study and notified by email.

Today I realized that he has been extremely cold his whole life towards me. 

I realized what happened in 10th grade when I opted to build something, rather than write an essay, for my science class with my father so I could spend time with him that he got mad because he didnt actually want to teach me how to build it. He instead got mad that I had opted for it and screamed at me and I ended up failing the project because I couldnt build it. 

Today I realized that my dad grew up telling me he would never lie, but he lied everyday. 

Today I realized that when my dad noticed my grades were dropping, he would offer help but never really wanted to. He would sit down with me and if I didnt understand it the first time, he would start screaming and I would just cry because I didnt know how to do it so i would walk out. 

Today i realized that me walking away from arguements wasnt being a rebellious child, i was walking away from the problem I needed to be sprinting from. 

Today, I realized that my dad's lack of interest in me buying my first car, speaks louder than his words. And that the only thing I've learned is that his actions have spoke louder than his words. 

Today I realized that my father thinking that having me on the phone plan and paying for everyone's electric and car insurance means our relationships should be perfect. And that the money or more important to him than his genuine relationship with his kids. 
(I paid for my phone, my car, I pay my fair portion of rent split between 4 of us, I pay for internet. Yet, here I am. I've never held it above his head to get my way.)

Today, I learned that my father's upbeat and giddy attitude is a lack of emotional sympathy and not because hes a good person. Always joking to the point that I'm screaming for him to stop because he jokes until he finds something that pisses me off.

Today I realized that my father lacks the ability to read the context of situations. He thinks the entire world is against him and blames us being 1-3 minutes late to our job every now and then on me and that it's why he cant get a promotion. 

Today I realized that my father blames all of my.flaws on my mom because he lacks the ability to accept fault

Today I realized why my mother cheated on my father. I now see that the countless screaming matches that kept me up at night in high school were what drove her away from the marriage. 

Today I realized that my father has manipulated me to choose him over my mother. Because he blames her for the problems they've always had and wants some form of affirmation to himself. 

Today I realized that I never spoke up about things that happened to me in school because my dad had beaten it into my mind that speaking up will start an arguement and that all my teachers thought I was lazy because of it. And when I stayed after school to get teacher help I stayed with the only teacher that was genuinely a bad person because she told me that I would never succeed and I was wasting my time bu staying after school and that this incident led me to beleive that my father was right. 

Today I learned that my father is not who I want to be. I will be better than him and know the difference between teaching my kids something and punishing them. 

Today, I learned that my father's actions have spoke louder than his words. 

I have put a lot of thought into everything that has happened in the last 3 years of my life. My father has always offered to help, but has only helped a handful of times when it was convenient to him. I realized that my eyes have been opened by the PC and reddit community that what has happened is not normal. I am now stuck in a situation where I have a brother who is extremely financially illiterate and my father's only way of helping him is to ""let things happen how they happen"" rather than show him the error of his ways. A situation where I feel it necessary to stay locked in my room just to avoid arguements with him. He refuses to ever take the calm approach to solving problems. And when I tell him hes yelling, he screams that hes not yelling. I make enough money to pay my current Bills and cant afford to move out and the only person I trust to move in with has a gf and cant help. I just wish I had enough money to get away from my father.

Mostly thinking out loud; feel free to comment and engage if you want. 

I was on a gaming forum a day or so before and there was a debate about whether the next Persona game should feature an ""aged up"" cast (young adults instead of teenagers). A couple posters were against it citing that it would be taking something away from the next generation of teenagers. 

I don't have much to say about the Persona franchise specifically but it got me thinking about how so much media (both classic and current) resolves around the experience of being a teenager and those problems. There seems to be very little media about 20-25 year olds and that experience. 

Maybe my teenagerhood was uncommonly easy but I find the difficulties of middle/high school overrated and the difficulties of the mid 20 period underrated.

Back to my previous comment, I was a ""nerd"" in high school but never bullied for it. Hell, everyone in my school was a nerd. We all played Pokemon, D&amp;D, Halo, etc. The jocks, prom queens, everyone. Perhaps I am a beneficiary of the time where nerd culture became more and more mainstream. I had good friends. I got good grades without studying. There was no teenage angst. No trying to ""Find who I was."" Perhaps this is because the basic building blocks of my identity were set fairly early as I've always had a strong sense of self. 

After I graduated College I moved halfway across the country on my own to start graduate school. At first I was very excited and I still believe it was the right choice. This gave way to a sense of loneliness that I believe can be typical of the post-college period. 

Firmly separating yourself from day to day life with your family, starting a career, trying to make friends/find a significant other without the structure of school/college, finding one's place in the world,   dealing with the loneliness that can often come with all that: that is what seems to define early adulthood. 

Identity seems to be a particularly interesting question/problem. In contrast with the, what seems to me, mostly superficial identity discovering/exploring that teenagers tend to do the young adult faces a more fundamental question: What kind of being do I want to be in this world? What career will I have, who do I want to spend the rest of my life with, do I want kids? The angst, uncertainty, excitement, and  questioning around those questions seem to pose different and more interesting conundrums. 

Which leads back to what prompted this in the first place. It seems strange that there is so little media targeted towards and about 22-28 year olds. There is the potential for interesting stories, new tropes, freshness. There is a opportunity to tell deeper, more original, more thought provoking stories. 

I'll finish with a question and maybe we can share some recommendations. What media do you know of that tend to be about and for 20 somethings. I, for example, like the anime ""Golden Time"" for many of the reasons I discussed above. Making it about college students gives it a different atmosphere, evokes different emotions, and allows it to avoid certain tropes. Not to mention the last half of the final episode is so good (I cry everytime). The characters have more depth. They are more mature. They can say and do things that make them feel more like real people. It can end with an actual marriage proposal that doesn't feel weird as opposed to the nebulous ""Well, I guess we're together now type relationships"" that seem to characterize teenage romantic fiction.  As an anime it draws a particularly stark contrast as about 95% of animes take place in High Schools. I have also heard the manga and now manga ""Sing Yesterday for Me"" is good at portraying the period right after college but I have not read it yet so cannot vouch for that. 

Another favorite of mine is the anime, manga, and light novel ""Spice and Wolf."" The mix of medieval fantasy, economics, and a simple romance is very interesting. However, because the romance is between a 25 year old and a early 20ish year old (She's technically thousands of years old but physically and mentally 22-23) the romance takes on a different flavor. They are less awkward, more confidence, flirty, and more playful. Somewhat paradoxically it seems that young adult targeted romances have less sex, focus on looks, and ""eye candy"" then teenage targeted romances. One of the most striking lines of dialogue to me is Holo's ""I'm tired of being alone."" I watched the anime first so you might think it's less striking in the manga or light novel but it's just as powerful in the manga and light novel. One of the main themes of the story is the loneliness that young-youngish adults often face. That theme shines brightest in the original light novel and it somewhat lost in its adaption but is still definitely there in the anime and manga.

I don't listen to rap, but rather folk-rock, alternative rock, Pop-rock, you know, all the white people music apparently. I'd rather be really good friends with a girl before I even dare ask her out, and I am very cautious around women not to say something weird or creepy. When girls don't usually care about what weird stuff I say. I don't know them good enough to dictate whether or not their reaction will be negative. I'm an English and Science nerd. 

It seems that whilst all my douchier friends are getting all the girls, I'm sitting here stuck in a loop about how to get out of square one with a girl.

I'm not trying to sound like a nice guy or a ""simp"". I'm just your really innocent friend, not due to religion or not being told what is what, but because I just am not around girls that much, or around anyone else for that matter. I don't simply jive with others' constitutions. I haven't had sex, kissed a girl, smoked weed, partied, etc. I'm mostly forgotten when friends invite. I'm always missing opportunities and getting worked up over nothing. If a girl were to like me, I'd probably dismiss her for trying to prank me, or hell, just woosh it over my head.

You know, I'm not a constant phone monkey. I don't sit and play with my phone all day checking social media. Usually, when my one of three video games I play is loading, I'd get on Reddit mobile and sift around. I have a Snapchat but I don't really understand it. I just use it to text a select few of friends and cousins, maybe post some memes. Idk. Most of the time, I meet girls through my friend, get their Snapchat, and then never talk to them again.

You may say that it isn't a big deal, but for half of my short life (19) I have been a huge Marvel fan, at least from 2016 I have watch every movie at the launch weekend so I wouldn't get any spoilers and I could enjoy the movies, this has been hard due to how expensive going to the cinema is in Colombia, but I was able to do until now, at the release at the game that can be the only good marvel super hero game on Xbox, and this is crushing the living hell out of me
It makes me so ducking mad, all my plans and ambitions for this year went to hell, and my living hell of country got our current currency so devalued all the money I save couldn't be enough for any of the games
So, that's all I can't get any money and my plans went down the drain, and me and my parents have been lucky to be part of the little percentage of people that were consider as essential workers, most middle class people haven't been able to work and poverty and disemployment have reach an unseen peak in the last 2 decades, I'm lucky to have everything I have, but man this little part of my life that I have work so hard to enjoy got duck, and the fact I can't do literally nothing about it it's just depressing

I'm not saying the show is great, frankly it's just absolutely fine (I'd give it like a 4 or 5 out of 10) but man people get absolutely livid over this show.

Problems with the show are apparent. It tries to be both a teen drama and an informative PSA at the same time, and tonally these things are so so different so the atmosphere of the show can be all over the place at some times. One minute it feels like you're watching a silly melodramatic show with unrealistic characters with unrealistic motivations, but the next it feels like I'm watching some super serious over the top anti bullying campaign ad. This is by far the shows biggest flaw.

But I see so many people get upset over the actual characters themselves. Hannah and Bryce are the two most talked about among YouTube reviewers. Hannah of course is said to ""glorify suicide"" but I personally think this is untrue. The show is *meant* to be ambiguous as to whether what Hannah did to everyone was right/fair. The show in no way celebrates what she does to the other students by creating the tapes as a heroic vengeance, instead it's actually the opposite. It shows the outrageous consequence it has on the students there, it's not clear whether what she says in the tapes is the full story or even if it's actually true, and personally I see it as being left to the viewer or not to decide if they side with Hannah or not.

Bryce is also a controversial character, being the one that raped Hannah and being the nail in the coffin that caused her to kill herself. But his arc in season 3 left so many people angry. It shows Bryce trying to change, to better himself, showing that he is trying to change and not be any more of a monster that he had been in the past, but people took this as the show trying to humanise the ""rapist"" character and paint him as an actually nice dude, as if it somehow justifies him raping Hannah. Of course, this is not the case. In my opinion the show is once again leaving it to the viewer to decide. It lets them argue whether a person who has committed a horrific crime redeem themselves and change for the better, or if they will always remain evil and can never truly change their ways. People that use Bryce's redemption arc to somehow criticise the show didn't truly understand what the show was trying to ask. So whether you think that's a fault of the show for not making it clear enough, or the fault of the audience for misreading the narrative, either way I think the show gets too much of a bad rap for this shit.

In my opinion the show itself is really not bad. It's far from being Breaking Bad sure but I think the shows fine for what it is. It's a mediocre Netflix show for teenagers, but from the way certain YouTuber armchair critics talk about this show you'd think it was the worst bloody thing in existence.

I don't have an 'online' relationship with any of my friends. The only time I get messages is when friends need my help with assignments. Over the winter break, I got incredibly lonely. Nobody spoke to me apart from to wish me merry Christmas. It was a very depressing three weeks. However, at least then my whole family was home.

  


I'm honestly dreading this holiday 6 weeks with one person to talk to. I know I can reach out to people, but from my experience, they never send more than a few replies.

One of my boyfriend's friends house, I went to inspect the drawer of this girl who lived there and when I opened it it was full of used cotton buds and opened tampons and it was filled with filth and dust to the point where even the unused but opened tampons were all grey and brown from all the filth and this drawer was filled to the brim. That's one example.

Another example was that at my boyfriend's friends house they had like 12 or so people living in one house, in two of the rooms there were 4 to 5 people sleeping on one single mattress that did not have bed lining it. It also had a cat pee stench filling the whole house and the kitchen floors were all sticky and makes a sound when you walk across it. These kids all have parents and are not homeless, they go to college...

At one of MY friends house, she has three cats and two dogs and two bunnies. The place smelt like a zoo! She has a degree and was going to go onto her PhD degree, her bedroom had a large animal cage in it for her dog and next to that was her bed that did not have a bed frame and it had clothes stacked high on it.

So theres this girl I've known for a couple of years now. We met on a long bus ride away from uni toward our hometowns and instantly hit it off and spoke for 2 hours. Let me start by saying she is drop dead gorgeous, to the point no one would ever think they had a chance with her. That being said I liked spending time with her for all the other reasons my other Male friends didnt; I always felt like she was a good friend I could rely on for solid conversation, advice and a laugh. I only ever saw her as a friend, initially because like all my other mutual Male friends, thought we had no chance. Obviously theres still been physical attraction, I just shoved it away as I genuinely cared for the friendship we quickly developed and didnt want to be like 99% of other people in her life that gave her attention on account of her beauty. It's been around 2 years of being friends and just before we all left for summer this April, our friend group got together to have a bush party bonfire. Her and I decided to smoke weed together which is a very occasional thing for the both of us. Fairly soon after when we were speaking I just felt something in my gut that I hadn't in a long time, I had feelings for her that I never thought would come about, but nevertheless they were there. Fast forward 2 and a half months to last week, dozens of mutual friends were all coming up to celebrate a birthday and enjoy the long weekend. I knew she was going to be there, and I knew I was going to find a way to tell her how I felt come hell or high water. I show up to the shindig a couple hours late as I was working, as soon as I got there she came to me to sign me up as her pong partner for the day long tournament (which we came 2nd). We got to spend a lot of time together on account of this. After this day party, people left to get food and changed and prepare to get together later for the evening. As I hadn't drank in a couple hours because I had driven, I volunteered to drive her and her roomate home, as i dropped them off they told me to come by later to eat and smoke. I returned soon after and her roomate was in the living room and told me she was upstairs in her room, so I go to get her. As I walked in she was in her bed, still in her bikini from earlier in the day and my brain almost overheated. We ended up talking for hours in there, her still having no idea how I felt. I steered the conversation to a crush I had and to see if she could guess who it was. Eventually being able to say ""shes just my type"". She asked, ""what's your type?"" And I said, ""You."". She was pretty blown away, and said ""I always thought you were a great homie. I had no idea."" I said ""neither did I, it came out of nowhere at the bonfire"" we kept talking about it, and how neither of us are capable of having a boy/girlfriend because were both busy and focused on school and a number of other things, but still just like everyone else wanted a ""someone"". Eventually the conversation changes but rejection nor acceptance were declared and i stayed hopeful telling her all I ask is her to have an open mind. As the night progressed we went to one of our friends houses, but it was boring so she offered to bring me to her other friends house where more mutuals were and I said sure. She quickly called me out playfully ""because you want to, or because I'm your crush?"" and I just played along laughing unsure of what I said. We get there and theres snacks and she starts hand feeding me which I thought was funny but no big deal. I started to fall tired as it had been a busy day with hours of partying on top of a shift at work for myself, I leaned sideways into the couch and she put her arm around me. This was a big deal as physical touch was never something we did. At all. So I'm just trying to play it cool but in my head I'm losing my shit. We eventually leave with her roomate who showed up at some point and I walked them home. They offered to let me crash as its late, to which I quickly accepted. They make popcorn and she starts feeding me again, after finishing it her roomate leaves to go to bed. Her and I continue talking until she brings up sleep. I asked, ""so where exactly am I crashing?"" She said she was sleeping naked cause she didnt have PJs and its disgustingly hot so I'm gettin the couch. I joked I could go get some PJs from my place quickly cause I'm scared of being alone in the dark. She playfully said no again. I said alright and talked about how fun the day was and I wish I could keep going but I'm so tired, she said she agreed. There was a long, deafening silence after this. Then our eyes met, and stayed locked. All I could think was now or never during that silence. I said ""fuck it"" aloud and she knew exactly what I meant, and literally jumped on me as I moved towards her to kiss and all the tension within us unleashed. Before I knew it we were on the couch, with much less clothing and all I could think was ""holy shit this is not happening what in the goddamn fuck how am I here right now."" I'll spare you the details but uglies were bumped. Afterwords, all I could hear in my head was a song that I hadn't heard or even thought of since who knows when - Once in a lifetime by the Talking Heads(I dont even like 80s music). The next morning she had to go back home, and I spent the afternoon in my chair replaying the entire day in my head and that song on my speakers wondering; how did I get here? I have no clue what happens next or what to do. I'm as equally worried at the now completely changed friendship between us and what it means for that; as I am excited that I took a shot from 5 miles away that hit a bullseye. Hopefully this post inspires someone out there to shoot their shot. I was fully expecting a no, but I would have rather heard that then never know her answer, and I'm glad I found out. If anyone has any idea what I should do from here please let me know as  I'm currently [plankton.](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/fLfLS)

Hugging is one of the cheapest ways to feel good. Yet, a sad reality for many boys/men is that they do not get enough physical contact. In fact, for many boys, outside of sex, hugging and cuddling is a rare thing. The standards are somewhat different for girls, who are expected to be hugged and cuddled.

There is ABSOLUTELY nothing ""gay"" about wanting to be hugged, or expecting a shoulder rub from your significant other, once in a while.

I was nervous so I had a friend introduce us and even then I was super nervous to continue but I got that number in the corniest of ways lmfao “hey can I use your phone to call my mom mines dead.” And I completely left my own spot to go sit with her and learn about her as much as I could before the concert... anyhow I found out she lived an hour and a half away, and as an 8th grade kid that’s a massive barrier. So we FaceTimed just about every night from that very night on for a year. 

We’d plan out if we were going to be in the same place at the same time and I made sure to try and go to every all state choir because I’d be able to see her. I remember playing football my freshman year and only thinking about her the whole game and being able to impress her because she came to see me play :) ugh we were cute as fuck :’). 

After then she went through a time period of high school hood rat life. And I wasn’t about it so I was upset with her a lot because of it.. but I looked past it as much as I could—we’d still talk be all lovey and shit and I’d still go see her volleyball games when she came into town for tournaments. But then shit hit the fan manly because we didn’t have much physical face to face time... My parents would not let me go see this girl no matter how much I told them I liked her. They started switching it up on me after a while but by then it was already too late (looking back was it?). She started looking into other people and sad as f, I started realizing I should do the same. Years pass and I always made sure to let her know I’m still here. Every new phone I’d text or almost every time I saw her tweet something sad or just whenever I felt like I needed to talk to her. I shared a note with her about things I realize I’m scared of, that turned into an ongoing conversation which I’m very grateful for.

Anyway she moved to Florida for school and now she’s back—for good—close enough to where we can see each other again. She just got out of a 2yr long relationship so she said she needs time for her and I’m totally cool with that. I just told her I want to see her whenever even if it’s like 1 time a month I just know I need to see and be near that girl. I’m so happy I got to see her and I’m so happy I have this feeling of missing her presence again. 

I’m not trying to post this for advice or anything because I don’t need it (at least at the moment lol). But I just wanted to put this story out there, solely because I’m so excited to see her again. 

TL;DR- I’m in the process of reconnecting with the most beautiful soul and I’m just super happy because I get to see her now. If I get my heart broken at some point it’ll be worth it.",youngadults,Just got back in touch with the girl I love :),0.0

I'm 19 almost 20, I had a best friend who is 16 (I met her at summer school). We both clicked and we started to text everyday. We started calling everyday for 5-6 months. Literally 4-5 hours everyday or more. I was dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts and would send me paragraphs everyday saying how I shouldn't be suicidal and I'm such an amazing and funny person. She gave me purpose in my life. Every morning id spam text her or she would do it to me. Every time I needed her she was there. In the summer everyday outside in the park I'd be calling her chilling in the bench. I helped her when she was suicidal I prevented everything that would drive her to suicide. I was dealing with mental issues I lied about my name to her because she said her parents don't like Muslim people so I thought she did too. It ruined me. She would prevent me in taking drugs, everyday. One day I told her I was going to commit suicide and she would be the blame (all because she left me on read. I was so fucking stupid). She called the police and she learned the truth about me. My name. And all that. She was so mad at me and the police said she can't visit my city because of me and apperently I'm a dangerous person which is complete BS. I'm pretty sure now that's lifted though. 

I still have her on snap and she still views my stories but I can't stop myself from crying because I'm never going to find any girl like her to be best friends with. Everytime I try to call my friends they have no humour like her, notning sparks up interesting. Heck that's even if they agree. Half the time they don't want to and make a bullshit excuse. My ex best friend knows I have body dysmorphia so she would never question why I wasn't showing my face. My friends now say ""I will if u show ur face"". I'll never wake up to spam texts like I had with her. I'll never have the same chemistry like I did with her. I'll never have the same convos like I did with her . As I'm typing this I'm realizing how lonley I am, and how fucked I am in life. I just can't stop crying guys. I'm depressed and lonely. My friends take so long to reply to me.

At home I was also stressed due to this affecting a part of my family financially so thanksgiving and Christmas breaks weren’t that enjoyable but I still powered through it and decided to try again to see how I feel about all of this.

Cut to this semester and I’m still taking gen-ed courses and some classes vaguely related but still required for my major but I’m really struggling with it due to depression and low motivation since psychology is only worth a damn if you go to grad school also and I really don’t want to waste another 4 years on that. 

Then the pandemic happened and my school didn’t do a good job at transitioning online. The only thing it accomplished was making the workload larger and I’ve always hated online courses even back in HS. Add that with classes I struggle with in which I’m not even interested in anyways and I’m considering just saying fuck it and drop out while applying for full time jobs since I just want to put my foot in the door and save up enough money to get my own place while just crawling up the ranks in this hypothetical job through actual experience instead of just using a piece of paper that claims I can perform certain tasks in a certain field.

Hi, I really think im going through a teen phase. I'm 19, and ever since high school, i barely made any friends. I'm kinda late with puberty so during HS i rarely had any interactions with girls or experiment any of the teenage drama/texting style/etc. I was also bullied too and i was very, very insecure of my looks. I missed out on everything.

At 19, im going through a high school phase. A lot of my friends i snap shit are 16+ although i have a lot of 18+ friends. I know 3 years isn't a massive difference and I'm only friends with these people (i want a gf older than 16), but like, idk. I'm only constantly on my phone texting and snapping my friends. Literally i havent studied because this whole thing feels so new to me. Get it? I'm surrounded with all the high school teen shit all at once. This is the first time where im feeling popular. Like, having so many people on my snap and shit. 

I'm also doing really stupid things. It feels like at 19 something just clicked into my brain and im going ballistic. It's so weird, i mean i really enjoy the popularity im getting i guess. And i actually feel happy, but thing is, im not in HS, im in first year uni. I'm not studying anything at all bc all im obsessed with is snapping my friends. 

Ever since i was comfortable showing my face, i got a lot of positive attention ( i have body dysmorphia) and now im just acting like a fuck boi on social media because i missed out on that too in HS.

I and my childhood friends have gone way back, we used to play toys and games (that aren't even video games) such as hide n seek, tags, or step-no... etc. We also played video games such as CS, League, DOTA, random RPGs. But because of time commitments and some of our friends moving out (either with their families, or for college) we all basically parted ways, added to the fact that all of us had our own friend groups from school and had different interests. We basically were inseparable in our childhood and early to mid teenage years.  

Years later... My friend (lets call him Gabe) just got home from being deployed as a sailor, and is now back in our neighborhood. So is my friend Aidan, who has just finished his college degree. Gabe called me, Aidan and one of our other childhood friends, Nick (who's lately focused on having a basketball career), last week to hangout and talk about random things, especially that he's back home. Then we hatched the idea of calling our other childhood friends to hangout and have a reunion by tomorrow. So we texted and called our friends, Jay (who lives in a nearby neighborhood), the siblings Jake (who's in college) and John (who doesn't really go out anymore) , and even Skyler (who lives in a much farther neighborhood and was actually the first one to move out), and even Gabe hatched the idea of us having drinks because were now young men anyways. 

The next day, (which was a week ago) they ALL came over, (Gabe, Aidan, Nick, Jay, Jake, John, Skyler, all of em) and well we had our first ever official adult activity, drinking gin \^\^. It was such a chill night, we talked about random things, then Jay, who's 21, actually told us that he's going to be a dad soon! It was pretty great knowing he's going to be the first one of us to become a father, but I mean in my mind, I felt like I won't be ready for that (for now). We also played music, sang songs together, and just learned that half of us are now obsessed with K-pop (when they used to make fun of me for listening to it)

Although there were not so good things that happened (like Skyler getting piss drunk and vomiting beside me and him throwing a fit and banging the door of his old house), overall it was such a great experience reuniting with my friends. It was interesting that we used to just play toys and random games and now we're grown up young men, looking forward to different things in life. I mean, Nick is pursuing basketball, I'm in corporate and partly in politics, Gabe's a mariner, Jay's excited about fatherhood... but we're still friends.

I'm just happy that we're still friends despite of the different paths we took. From little kids, to young men.

So it was natural for him to want his kids to play as well. Only thing is I wanted nothing to do with instruments and had, and still have, no rhythm. My brother(13M) didn’t have much interest either, but he still got a nice electric guitar a few years back, which I believe planted the seed. 

I say this because he all of a sudden decided he wanted to start playing guitar early this year, to our surprise and my dad’s excitement. He then started rubbing it in my face that he could do something that I couldn’t, which didn’t sit well with me.

That had me thinking that I could not let him out do me. We went to the beach a couple weeks ago and we all messed with my dad’s ukulele as usual, making the most horrid sounds possible from them. Then it hit me, I wanted to get better with it. So to my dad’s surprise I asked him to help me get better with it while we were there, and we both enjoyed it so much.

I learned the barebones of it during that weekend. He then surprised me with a ukulele for my 20th birthday last Friday, and I’ve spent several hours trying to get better with it. It is taking a while as I am really not musically gifted, but I really enjoy it.

I'm young and stuff, but I feel so worn down by life problems. During the pandemic my mom got laid off of work, my dad doesn't earn enough to pay for food on top of bills and now that's down to me. I have some money saved up from my birthday and Christmas and I'm having to spend that so my family can eat, meanwhile my 22 year old sister with a well paying job who lives at home won't help with anything. She constantly uses the electricity, to the point that we spend over £150 on it a month since she moved back home. The only thing She does is buy her own food, but that's always a constant argument because she always accuses the rest of us of using it when none of us even like what she buys.

Then I feel like I'm constantly the family therapist in a way. If anyone ever has trouble, I'm always the one who has to deal with it. I know every single financial situation we're in, I know every little bit of work-related trouble, I know the ins and outs of my sister's relationship, I know if my mom and dad have trouble, and I'm always the one who has to give out advice. The thing is though, that support isn't reciprocated. My sister and brother made fun of my eating disorder for years, my parents always make fun of my political views (after asking me about them), I never feel as if I can trust them. My mental health has been declining quickly for years and I haven't even felt like I could tell them. That isn't helped by them constantly making comments or making fun of how I look, act, and how I have no friends. 

School is also weighing me down. After being in lockdown for so long there is so much to catch up on and I feel like I'm suffocating in expectation and pressure to do well. I have mock exams in a couple of weeks and I'm not prepared at all. I have literally no energy left, and doing all the work and trying to focus is so hard. Not to mention how hard PE is now. On top of being constantly tired, I have to put all of my effort into not passing out in PE, because if I don't do good enough I'll get into trouble. And getting changed is a nightmare for me. I've always been self conscious, and everyone laughs at how look. I have lots of acne, and (trigger warning for sh here), my thighs are covered in self-inflicted scars. I have to get changed with everyone, and everytime I feel like crying. And when I do physical activities some of my scars reopen and bleed all over my uniform. I'm also trying to apply for college which in itself is causing a lot of stress. I need to prepare for that on top of my GCSEs and I'm just not ready. 

I honestly feel so emotionally, mentally and physically drained all of the time. I'm struggling a lot and no-one even cares. I feel like I'm losing my mind! And I'm finding it so hard to cope.

Anyways yea being special is overrated. I can only speak for the States but I feel like society and media geared towards teens/young adults places so much emphasis on being *different*, and *special*, and *quirky*, and *unique*. Cause that’s how you get the guy or become The Chosen One or invent the thing or become famous, whatever. 

And then social media compounds that. Sites like Twitter in particular - the very structure of which pushes us to think feel like part of a bigger group - makes jokes about people who fit a particular box. ______ starter kit (yes, i know it’s an older example lol). Liking or wearing or being an avid fan of xyz makes you basic. And so on and so on and so on. 

But at the end of the day nearly all of us are *some* kind of cliche, or have some other aspect of us that masses of people also relate to. And you know what, that’s *fine*. There’s literally billions of people in the world, and the search for the one interest or hobby that’s obscure enough to make you *different* is fruitless. Somebody somewhere did it, saw it, studies it, wears it, eats it, uses it, does it. You don’t have to become an expert prodigy at xyz skill just bc you feel lame by comparison to other people. 

Commonalities are what bring people together. And the ability to compare yourself as a person to millions and millions of other people is not only unfair, but literally unnatural. What generation before us was able to hold themselves up to others on such an enormous scale? That’s a setup for a breakdown.

My name is William and I am a graduate student at Tiffin University. I am conducting a research project for my class which is looking to identify risk factors present in young adults which predispose them to suicide. Suicide is a problem I am hoping to shed further light on as well as find effective ways to combat/treat. As I am sure you are aware of, the suicide rate in this demographic is steadily rising, so there is a strong need for studies on this topic. The link for the survey will be provided below. All responses collected in this research will be analyzed in aggregate form, and no names will be linked to the analysis.

If you are participating in this survey you have to be in the age range of 18-25 and have/had suicidal ideation/thoughts/behavior. Participating in the survey will make you eligible to enter a giveaway to win a $25 Amazon gift card.

Ok, quick toilet essay:

I originally started using the phrase ironically, but it really did start to grow on me. The time-tested alternatives all come packaged with their own flaws. ""That's just how the world works."" Fuck you old man, not *always* how the world works. ""That's just how it goes."" Same problem, plus these two sayings kind of imply a static nature to the world, as if the current situation is an unchangeable course. ""That's the way of the world."" Also implies a static/immovable nature to the situation, with the added bonus of being unsympathetic and dickish. 

And no, adding 'sometimes' to the end of these older sayings in an attempt to hedge your verbal bets, so to speak, is not a great option because it sounds ridiculous; you're clearly trying to dress up a meme. It's too uncanny valley. It's like wearing a halloween costume tuxedo to a cocktail party. I'm out of metaphors.

I'm a college student at a rigorous school. Going into it, I was really excited-- I used to love the idea of studying my butt off and learning new things. Obviously, shit hit the fan quickly the minute I started college. I don't know what happened, but I feel like I've been ""out of it"" ever since. I still maintained a tough plan. As a premed student, I had all these courses lined up, like ""Oh I'll take physics and o chem in the same semester and just find a way to stick my head above the water!"" As one would expect, that didn't work out and I basically drowned in the stress. It's not like I was doing well anyway (according to the average GPA at my school) but my GPA dropped from a 3.4 to 2.7. During the course of my GPA dropping, I felt nothing. I didn't really feel anything. It felt inevitable. I tried my best to study using whatever I could and found myself taking Adderall frequently to study ""efficiently"". It helped with my focus, but it didn't do much else.

Fast forward to today. I've had to make some tough decisions this semester and drop courses that I thought I could handle. But I've lost motivation. I've lost focus. Caffeine keeps my eyes open, but that's it. I've taken Adderall twice this semester and it helped me get work done, but I don't want to rely on it every time I feel like I'm losing control of things. Somehow, this semester has proven to be more challenging than previous ones and I find myself wondering whether I'm doing enough. The answer? No. Because I have no motivation to do anything. I probably won't get into a good grad school. I most likely will not go to medical school. I probably won't get an internship during my college career. And I feel like shit. I don't know what to do with my life. I've never felt so lost before.

Context: I'm 16M, and this girl is most likely 15F, or maybe 14F. I had no idea who she even was beyond the fact that she was part of the stereotypical annoying couple who publicly kisses and makes out with her boyfriend. About 2 weeks ago, she started flirting with me, usually right in front of her boyfriend. We concluded that some people are like that to everyone and that it probably wasn't anything special.

However, now I have evidence that the theory is not true. At the recent school dance, she was really aggressively trying to dance with me. And yes, it made her boyfriend mad. Like, whenever I was within 10 feet of her, she would walk away from her boyfriend and start dancing with me. A few times when I tried to walk away, she grabbed my arm and pulled me back. At one point, she was dancing really close to me, at the point where she was regularly touching me, She even tried to kiss me. When I tried to ask if she was already with someone else (more of a rhetorical question because I already knew the answer), she tried to avoid the question with ""do you want your first kiss?"" I'm really not convinced that she acts like that with every guy.

As much as I want my first relationship, I also don't want to be the douchebag who ruins someone else's perfectly good relationship to get it.

Context: I'm 16M, and this girl is most likely 15F, or maybe 14F. I had no idea who she even was beyond the fact that she was part of the stereotypical annoying couple who publicly kisses and makes out with her boyfriend. About 2 weeks ago, she started flirting with me, usually right in front of her boyfriend. We concluded that some people are like that to everyone and that it probably wasn't anything special.

However, now I have evidence that the theory is not true. At the recent school dance, she was really aggressively trying to dance with me. And yes, it made her boyfriend mad. Like, whenever I was within 10 feet of her, she would walk away from her boyfriend and start dancing with me. A few times when I tried to walk away, she grabbed my arm and pulled me back. At one point, she was dancing really close to me, at the point where she was regularly touching me, She even tried to kiss me. When I tried to ask if she was already with someone else (more of a rhetorical question because I already knew the answer), she tried to avoid the question with ""do you want your first kiss?"" I'm really not convinced that she acts like that with every guy.

As much as I want my first relationship, I also don't want to be the douchebag who ruins someone else's perfectly good relationship to get it. Also, someone who is that eager to cheat with me does not seem like a very good partner, even if I did want to be a douchebag. So how do I tell her to stop trying to cheat with me?

Hey y'all,  I'm 20 years old and finally found a girl that has any sort of interest in me Haha

I've only had one date in my life and I don't really count it cause it was mostly like an akward hangout with how it felt.

So I don't know how this works. We going to an arcade, I have to pick her up first though. Nervous about meeting her parents, they seem like the strict-tough on new boys type. 

But yeah like, is it ok to hold hands, or is that too early. Is it standard to (not)kiss at the end, or is it all just feel it in the moment. How do I even kiss someone? We've texted a lot in the last two weeks, and we like running out of things to talk about. I'm not good at in person interactions, that's why I wanted to go to an arcade so theres less awkward silences. Any tips on what to talk about? Tips in general?

I was fortunate enough to be in Australia twice this year.

On my second journey I was in Melbourne and with a friend rather than family. The most exciting thing to happen was the night I got so drunk I threw up in the middle of the city, passed out on a bench in front of a tram stop then got a lift home from the police.

I am recently not too long ago new to this community and already it feels warm. I'm sure many do or may feel the same way.

 So recently I've made a few posts about how I see my life as a book and I really do so much that I where I am now I've considered it my Phase One of this current chapter of my life . Of course in every book, at least the ones I've read, there's always a varied level of darkness or sadness or whatever that the main character(s) go through. 

As for me I'm this chapter, I am now going through a dark moment for I'd say about more than 2 or 3 months. Or rather a dark moment that I'm seeing. In short I have depression that can turn severe depending on the season excluding day to day life. My younger brother also has depression same to mine except for the seasons-dependency. Like I said, I'm currently seeing or rather looking at a dark moment: I fear that my brother may become severely depressed to make the you-know decision. It's as if he's a ticking time bomb. 

I would like to have a heart to heart talk with him because I also see what is uh ""fueling"", for lack of a better word, his depression. Through my perspective Ive learned that two Parties are both at fault. My brother and our parents. My brother is like any typical younger brother except he is a bit lazy or maybe a bit more. For him to do the common chores one would have to tell him to about 2 or 3 times. He also lies as well for example doing laundry. My family is of Mexican heritage, specifically from a small town about 4 or 5 hours away from Mexico City, and so they grew up in a mid-high to high-mid tough lifestyle. 

Because of this, I've seen how they passively use this lifestyle to me and my younger siblings. However, it has taken a toll to my younger brother. Of course,  my brother gets mostly scolded for not doing chores. Example: Cause - didn't fold laundry and played video games instead. Effect: Gets scolded and has phone taken away or two weeks. Another thing is that my brother over time has grown a short temper but lately he suppresses it and bottles it down. Using common logic, if you bottle so much down it can only withhold so much before it spills or bursts. Lately - I've seen my parents go either a bit or too over the top in their scolding. Of course this is whats normal for all children and parents. Child doesn't do chores and therefore gets in trouble from the parents. I mean most you people, who've read this far, probably gotten in trouble for not doing a chore, or other things etc., I assume have been at least more than 15 or 20 25 times over your childhood. If less than Congrats you  were a good child. 

Therefore I am going to have a talk with both my parents and my brother all at the dinner table together. As before, I've seen that both parties are at fault. However, my mother's birthday is this Saturday and that brings my plan down to a later date as so not to have any hard feelings just before or after the birthday. 

If you've read down this far to the rant, Thank you for your patience and your time into reading this and I apologize for the long ass paragraphs and if you feel as if any of your valuable time was wasted in reading all this I also apologize for that too. Wish me luck.",youngadults,Taking a pause for the better of my family. Warning: There is a serious topic I'll talk about if you're too sentimental. It might get taken down too.,0.0

I am 18 (F) who is working my first job at a drive thru five minutes away from my house. My father does not live with me, as my parents are separated. I live with my step dad and mom. 

My dad is quite overbearing and overprotective of his child. And while I try to understand where he is coming from, as a parent. It’s become emotionally and physically draining talking to him everyday. Because of Covid-19 my dad is very much against me working, and will not listen to me about how my work takes extra safety precautions in preventing the spread of the virus (I.e. gloves and masks, social distancing, customers are not allowed in the restaurant/only drive thru) He calls me everyday at 8:00 pm to make sure I am not working the night shifts and frequently tells me that I will die/get robbed/sexually assaulted, etc. I have voiced these concerns over other subreddits, and many redditors have told me that, he is utilizing fear— to make me stop working. It’s very invasive to have him call me everyday and only ask about work, and not whatever else is going on in my life— such as my university and working towards online learning. 

My mom is always there to pick me up five-ten minutes early from my work— and if she is maybe 2 mins late, I am free to wait inside the restaurant until my ride arrives. 

I am not proud of my actions, but I have been lying to my dad about what times I work, usually I work in the mornings-afternoons. However, recently, my manager has given me more of the night shifts. Today is the first day where I am working until 10pm, which is the latest I have worked (the actual restaurant closes at 12am)— I have told him multiple times that the drive thru is not 24 hours, and has a strict closing time- but he will not listen to me. I am dreading the phone call at 8pm today, because I will probably not be able to pick up: just for reference when my dad is very anxious or concern he sends my mom borderline threatening messages— and blames her for a lot of underlying issues. 

I am seeking advice from young adults about what to do to address this situation. Any advice is welcomed. Thank you.",youngadults,I am 18 (F) and seeking advice on how to properly tell my dad that I am working night shifts for my job,0.0

It made me wired; the thought of her death was too much to bear for me. And with all this COVID and Black Lives Matter protests going around, and me not getting to see my friends really made me feel doom and gloom. I didn't know what to do.

Between covid, my girlfriend breaking up with me, the riots and the protests I’ve also found that people who you think care about you just really don’t. No one listens everyone just wants to be right. But besides everything being horrible there’s always light. A level headed girl that goes to my university straight up asked if we could be friends and we’ve been having great conversation. She listens and argues and is so kind. It’s made me realize that even if this is a temporary thing, there are people out there that are worth it. So I’ve decided to delete my social media. Take it all away. I’m going to focus on making real conversations. Tomorrow I will be joining my first zoom church small group to connect with people. Hopefully I make meaningful connections there as well.

I was so hopeless this last week because I saw what people actually thought of me. But just because they suck doesn’t mean everyone does. Don’t give up. Fuck racism. Fuck fake friends. Fuck hypocrites. Fuck anyone and everything that tries to tear you down. We will come out of this better, kinder, stronger and happier.

I've been feeling a little sad because of a relationship that ended more than two years ago. Since I consider myself inexperienced in life (I turned 20 on March), I'd like to hear about your stories from the past and how you guys have overcome certain situations/feelings. As a side note, I think I worry too much about the past; now I'm going to explain why I think that.

It's just I can't over what you could call my ""high school sweetheart"", not as in I want us back together, but as the feeling of regret I get from having broken up to begin with. I had a girlfriend before her (we'll call her A), but it wasn't the same; I remember telling A ""If we ever break up, we'll have to move on and I'll wish you the best"" and then, after we broke up a year later I soon felt good and normal. (we'll call my high school sweetheart B).

However, when B and I started getting closer as friends, a year later we both developed feelings for each other and it was beautiful. One day, though, when we talked about what would happen if we ever broke up, I said, and I can remember this really well because I could feel how it hit me as I was saying the words to her: ""I feel like if our relationship doesn't work out, I will never be with anyone else.""

I don't really know what changed inside me from one relationship to the other, but I felt that way for some reason, and then we did break up. Now I regret that. We mainly broke up because of my fault, I don't deny that. I don't know if I'm trying to escape from it, but I'm always thinking of the past, ""why couldn't I be better."" Stuff like that, she really was... I don't know. Even her name is fucking beautiful.

I don't know, guys, I'd just be grateful to know your life stories, to perhaps find some inspiration in what you've been through. Thanks a lot in advance.",youngadults,How do you guys go from one relationship to another?,0.0

And they talk with such a passion and courage that anything less than that is offensive. ""Why would I want to dream small?"", said one of them one day. And that's okay.

And it's also okay to live a quiet, simple life. A 9-5 office job. Being friends with Nancy, from accounting. Talking to Robert every Monday about the game last night, even if you didn't see it. Spend a Sunday at home with a beer because you had a rough week and you just deserve it. Hanging out with friends every now and then. Never ""accomplishing"" anything ""big"" or world-changing. 

I wanted to change and eat the world at some point too. I did. I had my share of social volunteering, I even worked with a political party in my country because I thought on their ideas (later I regretted it but that's another story). Had a few ""projects"" while I was studying my arts major, even did some protesting.

And yet, nothing compares to this quiet life I've been living ever since I moved out from my mother's house. I go to work (well, used to, before COVID), do my job (which I really, really love, btw), go home, make dinner and go to sleep. Once in a while I (used to) go to a bar with some friends.

They also changed a thing with the elevator so that only they with a key can go to their floor, it wouldn't bother but every other day they have people coming and they knock on our door, even the middle of the night cause they can't get to the sixth floor.

They have build a metal door in the staircase room and they have a key for it so if they close it in a case of emergency or something were all screwed (I think that's me speculating, not sure about that alsoThey are the top floor under the roof, no occupants above them)

What can you do with them?

Senior year is supposed to be this mega fun final send off and I just don’t see that happening on my current track. I’ve always been a bit of a loner and honestly don’t need very much social interaction. I moved to a dif state the summer before junior year and I had a few good friends there but I’m only still in occasional contact with one. I’ve just gone an entire year at my new school without *any* friends and my life is a bit boring. I tried a few clubs that seemed interesting, went to several meetings, but they weren’t for me. I’m in a sport but it’s at the end of the year, so obviously that didn’t work out this year and also won’t bear fruit for the majority of senior year.

I feel like my problem is that I just don’t understand the nuances of social interaction. My parents don’t have any friends either, so I don’t really have a model for real life friendships beyond what I’ve occasionally observed irl and on tv. I’m not really sure how texting/snapchatting works, I don’t have social media, I don’t know how to ask people to hang out, what to do when hanging out, what conversations to have with random people, etc. I just don’t understand how to become friends with people unless I’m forced to do an activity with them for hours every day(my only old friends were from sports) because then it just happens naturally; you have no choice but to interact and they can’t just ditch and go off somewhere to do some strange spontaneous activity like meeting people you don’t know and talking about shared past experiences while I stand there unable to relate to the conversation. It’s so annoying when everybody somehow already knows each other and I’m always stuck on the fringe trying to get in. How did they even get to that position? I still feel 13 and like people “my age” are just as scary as they were back then. 

I think I’m fairly expressive and often make jokes in class. I’m definitely not unknown, at least in some classes. I can distinctly recall several people (who I had in several classes that year or kinda knew from sports teams) telling me they absolutely love me and my sense of humor. It’s definitely not a personality problem, at least not after they’ve known me for a while.

He was on medication and was going to therapy about 2 years ago. But he stopped taking his meds shortly after that and even stopped therapy.

Anyway, I study in a different state and I'm not home that often to really know what goes on with him. 
With the pandemic and college being closed, I came back home and a few weeks in, my brother broke down in front of me and said he's been feeling depressed again.
I told my parents about it and confronted them as to why he stopped taking his meds. I thought HE DIDN'T want to.
But apparently, my parents said that the doctor advised him so idk anymore.

After that day, he seemed to be back to his normal self.

Fast forward to a few days ago when my other sibling said he saw marks on his wrist.
I was worried but I didn't confront him about it because I wanted to be sure.

It was only a few hours ago that I actually saw the marks. They were vey prominent on his right wrist.

So now I'm scared if he might do something to himself.
What do I do? How do I talk to him about it without him freaking out? How do I tell my parents about it and how should they talk to him?

**“I would like to meet up with 6-8 HIV positive people, we can have dinner and chat”**

Place: Beijing, China. Time: This week.

**If you’d like to get in contact, please send an email at: xxx.**  
**No need for real names or photos, but I’d like to say your age, gender, hobbies, work, current status of illness and when you have time this week.**

Please be assured that I will protect your privacy.

First of all, **I apologize for the improper wording.** It is more reasonable to say that it is HIV carriers/infected rather than AIDS. **HIV carriers and people with AIDS are not the same group.** It was my fault that I did not pay attention to the words when writing this thread.

After posting this thread, I kept refreshing my inbox. Within five minutes, more than ten letters were received. For the next three days, my colleague and I have been reading letters and looking for their contact details. Some of these letters tell us about their illness and personal situation, whilst others contact us curious to see what the fuss is about. Furthermore, some messages express concern and support and some even expressed bewilderment.

To be honest, there are two common replies that I am particularly puzzled about:

One type of response is:

What are you thinking of? Those who sent emails will demonize HIV carriers, making me fear that even if I had dinner with them I’ll get infected with HIV.

Another response was:

""Wow, I never considered these issues regarding AIDS like this before!""-These people are expressing their compassion, but they talk about it disregarding the hardship that HIV carriers go through and make jokes without knowing the real situation.  
Its similar to raising awareness of HIV/AIDs in middle aged people, only for some uneducated 60-year-old to mention a sex joke and everyone laughs.

**HIV carriers should never be feared as monsters. But this does not mean that AIDS is a joke either.** You should not joke around when you are serious but not be nervous when you are relaxed. This is the perspective that this article wants to convey.

After getting everyone's consent, my colleague created a WeChat group. There were seven HIV carriers and one family member of AIDS patients. On the 19th, a total of ten of us ate this meal together.

Back last year, my parents showed some clear signs of tension and it climaxed in November of 2019. My younger siblings and I sensed of what was going on but, they officially broke the news to us that they aren’t on good terms with each other. They haven’t officially divorced and they still live on the same property, but my mom stays in the RV parked in our yard. 

It’s a weird living arrangement, especially since the two tend to avoid being near each other for a long time. They can still talk to each other for a family dinner and make “small talk.” But if say, mom wants to watch a movie with me for a couple of hours before dad comes home we’ll go to the RV, or Dad now sometimes will disappear to go visit a friend for the whole day and come back at supper.

It’s taken a long time to actually accept the situation and things are now just starting to settle into a norm for the family. But I can see the awkwardness between the two get bigger and it feels weird for us kids to bounce back and forth between them. And now, I’m frequently feeling torn between each parent and it’s pretty mentally fatiguing. Once the shock wore off of their technical separation I was okay with things, until now with the weird dynamics and changes settling in. 

Especially with quarantine and the whole horrible things going on in the world right now, I’m really afraid that I might be developing depression.

Been really struggling with the idea of forced loneliness lately. I've always thought of myself as someone who would be a really good friend if you give me the opportunity to be, but nobody ever wanted to give me that chance. Recently that's changed, and I've been a really bad friend to this person I think. I randomly act coldly towards them, ignore phone calls and messages, leave them on read, put 0 effort into our text conversations, etc. Things that should probably annoy someone enough to want to stop being friends with me. 
 
Thing is, I didn't start out like this. I did try to be a good friend at first, but it didn't really get me anywhere. They would often choose to hang out with other people instead of me, forget plans that we made together (but remember plans they made with other people), wouldn't invite me to do anything until the very last minute (as if they suddenly remembered I existed and went ""Oh hey, why dont we invite Vexed?""), talked with other people more enthusiastically than they talked to me, explicitly ignored me to talk to other friends, etc. A lot of my anger towards them just comes from my insecurity and need to feel important, and when they do things that make me feel unimportant, i get my feelings hurt and start acting coldly. 
 
I've tried to explain this to them, but I don't think I've done a very good job. They have a general understanding that I feel underappreciated and ignored, and much to their credit, they did make an effort to reach out to me more and be a better friend. But it hasn't stopped them from exhibiting the behavior that makes me feel this way in the first place. I don't know if they understand that their behavior is what's making me feel this way. Which is my fault, I've been pussyfooting around it to avoid looking like an overly sensitive baby bitch. 
 
On the one hand, I want to come clean and thoroughly explain to them what's been bothering me. But on the other hand, I feel like that's a lot to lay on somebody when the real crux of the issue is my own insecurity. Especially on somebody who's already got plenty of friends, so who gives a shit if I get my feelings hurt?

With the pandemic going on I’ve been in out of almost three jobs at this point and I’m scrambling to save as much money for the time being. I’m not exactly sure when I’m going to be moving out: I’m planning for the earliest October/November and at the latest December/January. I currently have a little more than 3K saved up. I hopefully plan to have around 5K/6K at very least when I finally leave. This is so I would have at least 3 months worth of rent plus some for extra expenses. I do not plan on living in a dorm and I do want a roommate or two. 

My question is what should I be doing now to prepare myself for when I move? What are somethings you regret you did or didn’t do when you moved out on your own for the first time? What are somethings I should be considering beforehand that most people don’t know/think about before a big change like this? When I move what are some of the challenges I’m going to deal with? What’s something that was an eye opener/shock for you when you first lived in your own?  Advice about roommates?

In less than a month my mother and older brother have to move to a new apartment. Can I just say it’s so tough finding a cheap 3 bedroom apartment around my area. My mother and father both separated so it’s just us three at home. 

I’m a part timer right now making $15/h. Being that I graduated HS in 2017 I should be graduating community college by now. Except I haven’t :/ I’m taking a hiatus from school to go full time to help my mother out with bills. Yet it’s so hard to find a job in the field I’m looking at (Information Tech) that doesn’t require a degree. 

We found a two bedroom apartment. So I’ll have to make some compromise with my older brother (honestly I act like the oldest). We have to move in by the end of the month and can I just say it’s all so confusing. 

Being a young adult, I have no clue what’s what. I don’t know how to handle all the paperwork and setup for an actual apartment. My mom asks me what this is and I tell her I have no clue. It’s stressful. I’m only 20 years old and I’m getting thrown into this with no clue what I’m doing. 

Maybe I’m just being a little bitch about things. I’m applying for another part time job which I can hopefully land, bringing me to 40 hours a week. I just wish I was 16 again, not worrying about stuff like this.

Most of my problems started after I broke up with my ex gf. I honestly think it was the worst decision I ever made. Her family and I never got along so I figured I'd let her go because I was older and things were only going to get more dramatic between her brother and I.

I don't want to spend my life alone and miserable because I'm short. I've posted on Reddit a few times and people flat out told me it'll be extremely difficult to meet women post high school due to my height and that I should settle for whoever gives me the time of day. Of course, this makes me feel worse. I’m just so exhausted I can’t take it anymore. Each day is a struggle.

I moved away from where I grew up to go to uni, and then moved to yet another town after uni to find work. I've tried joining a few clubs (any archers here?), but I only ever find people who are too young (kids or teenagers), or people who are too old (30+, generally the parents of the kids) to really be able to relate with where I find myself in life. The parents can relate to what it's like being in their early 20s, but they relate to what it was like 10+ years ago rather than what it's like now. The same goes with work colleagues.

I guess what I'm trying to get at is that I'm struggling to find people at the same ""life stage"" as me, and I'm unsure whether they're just like me and don't really put themselves out there much, or if I'm just looking in the wrong places. I'm also struggling to find what my place in life is, how I should define my life, and how to change things to make me happier.

I fell into drugs at a very young age and lost almost all of my teenage years to things I regret in hindsight, including a s****** attempt. Everything changed around the time I was 18, though. I decided to turn my life around. Quit everything, started working out and gave all my time to my education and it was going pretty good until last year I got a call from one of my bestfriend's brother, telling me my friend had died from drug overdose. I felt like the ground had vanished beneath my feet. I couldn't breathe, couldn't feel my heartbeat and I haven't really been able to wrap my head around it since. I've felt like I haven't been living a good life, and that I am to blame for my friend's demise as well. I've tried turning it around. I'm majoring in computer science and physics at the time and I've indulged into a lot of social work, talking about women rights, drug abuse and other problems in my country but I don't feel content, I don't feel like I've made up for everything I've been doing for the last 20 years.

What (and When and Where)
I will be doing this :
1. Hey guys! I am finally ready to announce my 200 Follower Special stream. We hit 200 followers 2 weeks ago and since then, I have planned something very special for it. I will be trying to raise $100 for “The Michael J. Fox Foundation || For Parkinson’s Research”. 
2. I will be doing a 12 hour Charity stream raising money for “The Michael J. Fox Foundation || For Parkinson’s Research” in Honor of my Father who has Parkinson’s disease on April 18th (the Saturday after Easter) from 10am EST to 10pm EST at
https://twitch.tv/backtosnack 
3. For most of the stream, I will be playing : 
The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild : Master Mode (this just makes it harder and gives the enemy more health.)
4. For Part of the Stream, I will be playing Wii Sports with my Father. It will take place whenever my Dad feels up to being on stream and isn’t too stiff. We will be playing and talking about how Parkinson’s disease has affected his life.

Why I will be doing this :
1. For my 100 followers special stream, I had a few friends over and just had a really good time. Now, I have 200 followers. I am still a SUPER small streamer, but I do feel like I do have a community at this point. There are regulars who watch the stream and a good amount of people know my stream. This has lead me to feel like I have enough followers to have a successful charity stream. I also held a spontaneous charity stream a few months back when I had 150 followers for “Team Trees” and I was able to raise $50. That stream was just out of no where with no build up or donation incentives. I feel that with 200 followers, build up and better PR about it, and donation incentives, I’ll be able to hold a successful stream and raise at least $100. 
2. My Dad, John, first went to the Doctor about having Parkinson’s symptoms when I was 2 years old. On the date of the stream, I will be turning 18 in a month. My dad was diagnosed with Parkinson’s when I was 3 years old. I never got to know my dad before Parkinson’s personally. I have been told stories about how lively and happy he was, how he’d do anything to cheer up my siblings, and was overall, an amazing guy. Even with Parkinson’s, my dad is my hero and my main inspiration, but it is just different from what my older siblings know of him before it all. Every day, I have to help my dad doing simple daily tasks, from dressing, to eating, to even walking from one room to another. He has not driven in a few years and he doesn’t work anymore as well. I know he wishes he could do more, but it is coming to a point that people need to do things for him. Even so, he still snowplows for single lady neighbors, who physically can’t themselves. I want to do this to give back to him for everything he has done for me and countless others. If I can do anything that would allow a kid like me, to at least be able to get to know his father before Parkinson’s, I’d do everything I could to allow that to happen. That is one of the many reasons why I am doing this. 

As stated before, I will be raising money for “The Michael J. Fox Foundation || For Parkinson’s Research”. My father has Parkinson's so I thought it would be best if he was the one to choose the organization I  raised money for. I sat down with him and we watched a few Parkinson Charity's Videos and he chose “The Michael J. Fox Foundation || For Parkinson’s Research”. He especially liked how their website states, “The Michael J. Fox Foundation is dedicated to finding a cure for Parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with Parkinson's today.”

I am doing the Charity Stream on the 18th of April to allow for the most amount of people to be able to show up for the stream. I wouldn't want to do it Easter weekend and then have nobody be able to show up and support the stream. That is also why I will be streaming for 12 hours. My timezone is EST, but many of my viewers are in different timezones so this gives plenty of time for people to find a time that they can stop by and watch the stream, if they'd like. 

At first, I had a hard time figuring out what game I was going to play for 12 hours on stream. I couldn't decide so I headed over to r/Parkinsons and asked them. They suggested that I stream The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild. I am not just playing BotW because it is an amazing game ( even though it is ), but because it has a meaning behind it. While I, a healthy teenager, can easily grasp the controls of BotW, many people with Parkinson's cannot. Their disability doesn't allow them to easily hold a controller and focus on performing multiple button actions quickly or simultaneously. I am playing BotW to show that most people with Parkinson's are unable to play video games with ""complicated"" controls. I'd imagine that there are even people out there who are gamers that previously could play most video games just fine, but now they can't with Parkinson's. I don't have memories of playing many video games with my father because he is unable to play along with me. This isn't exclusive to BotW, but it is a good example of a game that many with Parkinson's cannot play. I want to help people understand how this disease can affect many aspects of people’s lives, from big things like relationships, to much smaller things like gaming. I hope that my small act of playing BotW, can help others understand how hard this disease can be on people.


Smaller Reasons why I chose to play BotW : 
I created a list of donation incentives for BotW. I thought these might encourage some viewers to donate and create a fun stream atmosphere. 
I have not played Master Mode yet so I thought it would be even more fun to see me fail at Master Mode. Playing on Master Mode would also mean that I’d start a new game, which works well with the donation incentives. 
BotW is my favorite game of all time so I wouldn’t get bored of playing it for 12 hours or so. There is just so much to do in it as well, that if I did get bored of 1 section of the game, I could venture off somewhere else. 

4. The few video game memories I do have with my Dad are mostly memories of playing Wii Sports with him. As many of you know, Wii Sports is not complicated at all. There is only one action you really have to do which is swing the Wii mote. I asked my dad if he’d be up to streaming Wii Sports Bowling and Golf (his 2 favorite Sports from Wii Sports) with me. I also asked him if he’d be willing to talk about his experience with Parkinson’s and how it has affected his life. He said that he is okay with both of those things. This will probably take place at 12pm, or just whenever my dad is feeling up to it. 

How you can help! : 
All proceeds of the stream will go towards “The Michael J. Fox Foundation || For Parkinson’s Research”. 
All Bits, Subs, Gifted Subs, (All Tier 1 subs count as $2.50 as Twitch takes half) Ads, and Donation will go towards supporting “The Michael J. Fox Foundation || For Parkinson’s Research”. 
You can Donate directly by either buying Bits and submitting them in chat, or donating through my streamlabs donation link,
https://streamlabs.com/backtosnack 
Or if you don’t trust that I will donate the money, you can donate directly to the cause I am raising for at https://www.michaeljfox.org/donate 
If you don’t trust me, on my Instagram and Twitter (@backtosnack), I have a post showing my donation to Team Trees, which was all from Money raised on Stream. 

If you want to help, but don’t have cash to, you can 
Subscribe with Twitch Prime. If you have an Amazon Prime account and link it to your Twitch account, you get Twitch Prime for Free. With Twitch Prime, you get a free Tier 1 Twitch Prime subscription. If you don’t know how to do this, here is Twitch’s guide on doing this. It is very simple. https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-link-your-amazon-account
Watch Ads to receive Bits on PC. Bits is Twitch’s cryptocurrency. Every bit is equal to 1 Penny. 100 Bits is 1 dollar and so on. In the bottom right corner of chat, there is a smiley face and a diamond. Once you click on that diamond on PC or Mac, a purchase bits box will pop up. On the top of it, there is a Watch Ads to receive bits option. Click on that and you will have to interact with the ad, but after the 30 seconds, you will receive bits. You can do this a few times until you run out of ads to watch. 
SHARE THIS WITH YOUR FRIENDS!! This one would honestly help a ton! Just sharing the announcement to your friends and family would mean a lot to me. Plus, the more people who watch, the more ads will be shown before the stream, which will earn the charity even more money!

Today's question is

**What's something you're glad to be able to do now that you couldn't when you were younger?**

Since we're all slowly becoming adults, I'm pretty sure some of us are glad to be able to do things we always wanted to do.


For me, it's being able to buy stuff.I still ask for permission of course but being able to buy my things myself on Cards,Games and Food just gives me such a nice and rewarding feeling.

But don’t turn to drugs like I did, and don’t make friends with your dealer. Don’t substitute “free time” with criminal actions that later on diminish your life.

I went from a smart kid with a bright future to a useless liability. I had a full ride, guaranteed college admission and a future career in law enforcement. I threw it ALL away. I replaced my full ride with a $5000 bond. I replaced my future with a potential life sentence, which I’m facing next week. Don’t ruin your life guys, just because you don’t feel alive doesn’t excuse deviant behavior or abuse of a controlled substance. I erased myself in one night. I’m committing suicide shortly to finish what I started the night I ended my life.

Do what’s right and don’t stray, people need you! Just know that once you’re a felon then you aren’t ever a useful or required individual, and nobody will care if you’re sad. Hell I’m shooting myself and I know if I fuck up and live I’ll get arrested for illegal possession of an AR15 that I haven’t given up to police yet. Imagine being in that dark of a place because you wanted to do drugs? Imagine replacing your dorm with a jail cell? Imagine caring about being a person with goals and a future one moment but the next all you’re focused on is your suicide?

Please don’t be like me. It can happen to literally anybody, but please don’t let it happen to you.

After a few difficult years of self-improvement (I am now 20 years old) I can now at least have a normal life, except with something almost stupid but difficult at the same time and it is to relate to women.  


It was like that since I was in school and I feel very ashamed to talk about it with anyone, I resign myself every day to converse that if I am alone I have more time to achieve my goals and so I can sleep well one more day.  
But the case now is that my sister told me a few days ago that a former colleague of mine wants my phone number, years ago I was in love with her because I felt identified by the same life we ​​had (you could say that we were both nerds or something like this), and I never talked about how much I was interested in having an appointment with her or something, but I think even she already noticed.  


Unfortunately, because of my fear, I simply told him not to answer anything, to delete my Facebook and my phone was broken, my sister simply stopped talking to her and had no problem afterwards, but I feel like shit for wanting to avoid something I always wanted , even if it's a damn simple call to say hello.

Thankfully, the doctor did NOT take that much time, and I saw her in like 7 minutes. 

Now, she started by saying that my hemoglobin was a bit high, which could have been due to dehydration. My electrolytes etc were fine. I already was in the middle of the panic attack, and I was just squirming on my chair, barely able to control myself... Then she mentioned that my testosterone is slightly lower for a person my age! That's a shocker. A person as red-blooded, as straight, as amorous, as romantic, as passionate, as idyllic, as virile, as quixotic as me should have no testasterone problems. 

So maybe that's what's been causing my hair problems. We will follow that up and get another test to get to the bottom of this.

Then I actively tried to avoid him but kept running into him everywhere, and it was weird but we started talking more. I decided hey, this dude seems cool, so I decided to attend 2 of his office hours. I thought it went well during the first one, but apparently afterwards he asked a guy in my group about me and tried to make it out to be that I was following him or something.

Well it's been almost a week now and the impression I get from him is cliquish and stuck-up but subtly trying to hide it. It seems like every time I'm away from the group to do my own thing and have some alone time, he's with the group and situations involving me come up a lot. He's a decent person and pretty popular, and I still like him, but I'd never get with him.

I know he knows that I like him, and my group knows too. But he probably thinks I go out of my way just to hook up with him, when really, I just want to talk to him, get to know him, and be less lonely while talking to a nice-looking person. Maybe on the first 2 days I wanted to hook up, but that passed quickly and it would just suck in so many ways if it actually happened. 

This really annoys me and tomorrow I plan to do something about it. For most of the day today he's been avoiding talking to me, and I've been avoiding talking to him.

When I was at his office hours with the others, he let me hold his livestrong rubber bracelets and I forgot that I had them on because I wear a lot of rubber bracelets a lot of the time too. I don't want his bracelets and all day I've been wondering how to give them back to him without actively trying to find him, or how to get rid of them. I prefer Hawaiian breeze anyways, I've had enough Gain for the day thank you very much.

I think I'll try looking for him tomorrow, give them back, make sure to let him know that I'm no longer interested, and get on with my life. But I have to make this not awkward bc he hangs out with the group I'm in. 

It's such a shame bc he is actually an interesting person, but the whole talking behind the back thing.

Also I'm fucking stressed out bc I went out past midnight and this is the third consecutive morning where I've had a run-in with some drunk dude trying to get me to tell my whole life's story to them. Turns out, he's one of my RA's boyfriends, and now she knows I have weed in my room.

Ok, so. I normally NEVER do this stuff and have almost never done it. But this happened when I was 17. There was this girl I BARELY knew. I knew nothing about her, and eventually she turned out to be a bit younger than I thought. Anyways, I had a dream that I was poisoned and dying, and when I woke up I was so happy to be alive and felt Romantic. This girl, went to a school that is near my house, so I decided to do something romantic. I got dressed up, and when I used to try, I was good looking or so I thought. Anyways, I really got dressed up in a leather jacket, put eyeglasses etc. Now, I had literally NEVER done anything like this. In fact, I have severe anxiety. Basically, I went, my heart pounding. I saw her among the crowds at the end of school, I walked up to her, she smiled nervously. My hands were shaking, but I threw down my glasses and said ""Kiss me"" in front of everyone! I was expecting her to do it or something, but she LITERALLY ran away. When I walked up more, the school staff told me they could call the cops if I did not leave. I was in panic when I left, I had LITERALLY never done anything CLOSE to this before EVER! It really backfired, I was a total idiot",youngadults,My attempt at being romantic backfired once,0.0

we talked even more and both realized that we had underlying issues that were better reasons of why we should break up. after a few days of both of us thinking about it, she said she had made up her mind. she felt really bad because she could tell she really meant a lot to me and could tell i really loved her and her feelings weren’t as strong.

Two of them (18M and 17F) started 'dating' a couple of weeks ago and met irl on Friday as they live in adjacent states.

Now I would like to point out that some portion of these people I play with adhere very well to the 'no-life gamer' stereotype (stay in playing games all day, don't really have friends irl, don't do hobbies or social stuff). The girl even told me that she had never been to the movies with a friend, ever, until her now bf arrived.
Yet, these two seem to be hitting it off really well, and lots of us thought it was cringey at first.

I might be an asshole, but I seem to have a problem with this because [I thought] I knew perfectly well that no one would ever succeed socially by staying inside playing videogames.
So this whole time I surrounded myself with irl friends and a social life (a lot of which was annoyingly high maintenance and based on acolohol/weed until I came to uni), because the payoff was [quite obviously] supposed be better.

But now these two people who don't go out ever come along and against all opportunity costs and odds, make it work really well.
I feel like I've had it wrong this whole time, and against all principles of economics I've just wasted my time with local girls (I also personally had various bad experiences meeting girls from snapchat at parties and etc) when I could have invested more time in people who actually had similar interests as me. Like I was just trying to the most economical thing. 
 It may be the case that I'm just not able to do E-stuff from the beginning. My country is culturally rigid, and that stuff would be considered weird here.

I feel like any new interest of mine is illegitimate and I'm trying to be someone that I'm not. Hookups provide me the attention I need and I'm scared I don't know how to connect with people anymore. I'm not sure who I am or where I'm going. People tell me I'm going to be successful and all that but the structure that got me to this point is gone and I have no idea what's going on anymore. I feel like I'm in a phase but maybe becoming an adult is a phase. I've been too scared to confront this, and haven't talked to anyone about it. I know this post is nervous word vomit but I would love to hear anyone elses experiences with points like this, or advice or anything really.",youngadults,Are you stuck?,0.0

Last week my friend told me if I want to get back to it especially he wants to see me gain some mass. I considered it and I’m definitely wanting to take the chance especially gym sessions are cheap. (80 cents - session) plus the gym closes at 11pm during the weekday which is a bigger incentive honestly to get back to it!

So there, I and my friend agreed to start going to the gym this week! Next step... trying to get my calories and protein up.

First. So I'm going to be a senior at a new high school starting in two weeks, and I'm kinda nervous because I know nobody at this new school and most of my life will consist of me working \~30 hours a week. I'm only taking two classes which is why I can still work that much. So I'm kinda just freaking out about that.

Second, in the spring semester I'm going to be going to my local community college for free (paid for by my school district) and I don't think I'm prepared. Is there much of a difference from high school?

Third, I would like to move out soon but if I don't know anybody that will share an apartment with me it'll be too expensive and I would have to keep saving and living with my parents. And if I have to pay for an apartment on my own, I can't get a car which would be nice but I guess I can take the bus every where.

As some context; I get paid 11.50 an hour and work 24-30 hours a week meaning I make about 600 bucks a month. I live in Colorado so cost of living is way higher. My parents will only let me stay at their house for free if I'm going to school.

The sub has grown a ton since the last post I made and we've come a long way in the 2 or 3 months we've been here. One topic that has continually been brought up time and time again is why we don't allow memes. The easy answer to this is that many of us were moderators of /r/teenagers, we've seen firsthand what the excess of memes can do to a community. We want a subreddit that is built upon fun and interesting discussions that will get you talking to one another. But we're not blind to the fact that a good meme can do just that as well. So, we're going to try a compromise. 

---
Starting this Saturday at 12AM GMT we will enable link posts and then they will be disabled at 12AM GMT Monday. During this time frame memes can be posted as much as y'all would like. The only condition is that memes must stay relevant to young adults. Don't turn this into /r/DankMemes or any other random meme sub. If you post memes that are not relevant then we will remove them. If you have a question then please feel free to [send us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fyoungadults&amp;subject=&amp;message=) and we will answer you asap.

In the meantime continue posting about your days, your thoughts, questions you have, ask how everyone is doing, etc. There's not much that we *don't* allow as long as there's some bit of effort put into the post. Look over our sidebar and familiarize yourself with our rules. [Join our Discord if you'd like to get to know some of us better and have a chat.](https://discord.gg/H4MExba) We're currently having a fun game of guessing if new users are bots or not.

There is this mythical creature that so many people talk about. They usually call it ""girlfriend"", but some style it ""gf"" for short. These creatures are very commonly used for plots in fictional movies. There are rumors that some have even domesticated this mythical creature. The legends are so many and conflicting, but one thing they agree on is that this mythical creature is very elusive. In fact, it is so elusive, that some people have concluded that this creature might not even exist. Though, the consensus of experts is that there is more probability for the existence of this rare creature. Legends describe very hard processes for drawing this mythical being near you. Since the rituals of attracting this mythical creature are so elaborate and devious, some experts believe that the techniques underwent significant evolution throughout the time, as the myth about this creature developed throughout cultures.

Using a throwaway bc he's following me on my other account.

We reconnected a few months ago at this local festival and occasionally hang out + volunteer together when we're not busy. In middle school, I'd see him around whenever I was hanging out with his brother when they were both back in town from college, and I fell hard for him bc middle school me was into 2007-myspace-emo boys, and he hadn't (still hasn't) evolved since he was in highschool. He'd never pay much attention to me, but his brother was really friendly, and his brother and I are better friends than him and I.

&amp;#x200B;

Now we're better friends, but he has this insane work schedule, so we barely hang out. He has a concert tomorrow, and I said I'd be there to hear him perform, and afterwards we're getting boba and taking time off to hang out as \*just friends\*.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing is, he knows I'm \*really\* good friends with his brother now (if ya know what I mean), and I don't like him like \*that\* anymore. And I want to keep it like this, but middle school me resurfaces from time to time to make me go through these random spurts of hell where I fall hard for him again and make things awkward. It tends to happen whenever I listen to Paramore, and it doesn’t help that nowadays I’m more in tune with my emo side.  


He has this idea that I'm this incredibly nice, thoughtful person who loves volunteering and all the same kinds of music he likes, but I'm really just a depressed asshole who only likes some of the same genre as he does, so I feel like a fraud. 

I feel like the only reason we're okay hanging out with each other is because it's just as friends; he cares quite a bit about what other people think, though he won’t admit it. I’d never get with him because I know him better now, and I don’t see it ending well if we ever got together. He’s pretty introverted, slightly judgemental, but he’s a friendly guy and tries his best to be nice to everyone and be positive about everything, which makes it kind of hard to understand what he’s really feeling. 

But it doesn’t help that whenever we’re in public, people automatically assume we’re dating because (shameless bragging) we’re both tall, skinny, and pretty photogenic. It gets instantly awkward whenever this happens, and then the person goes something like “aw you guys look SO GREAT together tho” and makes it even worse.

How do I make it through lunch staying chill and just friends without fucking anything up and turning it into a date?

I did something extremely bad, like it is by far the worst thing I've ever done. If you don't want your day to be ruined by my problems, stop reading right now. 

As I said, it is something I'm extremely ashamed of myself, can't look myself in the mirror, I feel numb, I don't have the heart to tell this anyone but people who are involved in this. I'm scared of going out and looking people in the eye, hell, I don't even have the courage to look into my mom's face. 

I hurt someone who I love very, *very* dearly, probably something she'll never recover from. She had some trust issues and I was probably one of the few people who she trusted the most, and I broke her heart, her trust and ruined her life. She'll probably never trust anyone ever, and I will never forgive myself for what I've done.

If I'm feeling this shitty, I can't even imagine how she feels right now. I try not to think about it, anytime I'm by myself, with my thoughts, I feel nothing but remorse. And it is fucking killing me, it is unbearable and I don't know what to do. I want to kill myself just to not feel like this. I don't want to exist anymore, it would be better for everyone, maybe she would feel better that way, knowing that I'm gone. 

I want to make things better between me and her, but it is literally impossible, and feeling this powerless fucking sucks. I miss her, I miss being able to talk to her, I would give everything just to talk to her for 5 minutes. I have nothing but regrets, but I can't change the things I've done, I am literally unable to make things right. 

I have no idea what to do right now, I play games all day, rarely attend to classes and smoke. I lost my apettite, don't work out, and if I eat something it usually unhealthy. I feel like I won't have a normal life ever again. 

I feel like I didn't express myself at all, there are no words in any language to describe how shitty I feel. Thank you for your time if you read this (rant? confession? ) so far.

It's my first time here and I'm sure I'm not the only one with these woes, but maybe some of you have more positive mindsets and could help me even just go about my daily life with a little bit more motivation.

Anyway, I'll get to the shit part. I live in the Philippines, and some of you might have ideas of a tropical paradise but trust me, nothing about this place is paradise right now. We're literally drowning.

I'll skip the murderous president because that's the least of my worries already because honestly? Whether or not Duterte is running this shitshow, it's still the same. Corruption and evil is so deeply sowed into the systems here that there's no way this can turn around. It's not just because the government is evil, but everyone has gotten so cheated on here that the only way to live is to try and beat the system with money or crime.

I'll use the simple example of getting a drivier's license: literally no one I know went through the brainmelting, multi-day, hours-long, waiting-in-a-hot-government-facility process of getting their license. They pay a fixer that works in tandem with these government workers to get their licenses. I can pay a fixer 100 USD, and he'll get basically everything but my signature done for me, then he'll split the money with the people inside the office. It's already such an open secret that no one fucking cares anymore. The only way to get a license is to pay twenty times the amount of the registration fee just to get a license that you didn't even take a test for.

That's not the only thing rotten to the core. Everything, from building contracting to food preparation to the entertainment industry, has a cheat or a bureaucracy or a pay-to-get-in system that everyone knows about, and it's become the norm because that's the way it's been done for too long and children now know that the only way to get good in life is to cheat someone else or use money to get ahead.

Evils are so deeply ingrained in our systems of capitalism and imperialism that I don't see a way out, especially when those who got ahead using these systems are the most powerful people.

What bothers me the most is that social media has made us see that these system exist in literally every part of the globe, in various degrees. I always dreamed of living in Japan or the US, but updating myself with the politics and culture of both countries made me realize: holy shit, we're all living in the same nightmare! Fascists, dictators, imperialists, strongmen, blood-sucking capitalists, they're everywhere!

It's gotten to the point where consuming ANYTHING in this world has made me guilty. Was my butter made using tortured cows that are excruciatingly squeezed of bodily fluids due to capitalism's money-first mentality? Was my water taken from a dam that deforested hectares of land taken from indigenous people who were forced out with excessive violence? Were the parts in this phone I'm using right now gathered by slave children living in poverty?

EVERYTHING IS FUCKED. AND I DIDN'T EVEN GET TO CLIMATE CHANGE YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Anyway how do you live life when everything is so fucked? I want to live out my dreams. I want to find a good guy, start a family with him and live a modest life. I don't even want a mansion or a nice car or a lavish lifestyle. I've just always wanted to do my best, and reap whatever I sow.

But now, every time I try to imagine my future, it's a black mess of void, because I don't see a future. I don't even know the point of human life anymore when people who are either dead or dying have fucked us over so hard that recovering is impossible.

The point of the channel is to explain that nothing can last forever, but also that 365 days is more than enough time to change someone’s life, for better or for worse.  As of current, I am in a deep mental fog on what I’m actually doing with my life.  I’ve completely given up on putting work into college classes and have no drive for anything at all.  It began back in late 2019, but subsided briefly when I was home with my family for the summer.  Of course I was able to scrape by with courses last semester because I wasn’t quite *there* yet mentally until fall came around.  The mental devolution of everything I built up previously wasn’t noticeable until now either.  I don’t know what I can do to turn my life around before the clock runs out on this semester. I’ve got 2 weeks before everyone I know learns I’m a failure.  The deletion of the channel made me realize what I’ve become and that I haven’t made effort to seek help, deciding not to make the most out of life but instead try to wait it out or hope the clock runs out on society first.  But the world keeps on moving.  Nothing is going to stop for anybody, and I’ve realized that too late.  So now I’m left here, friendless, lonely, and all out of time.

I have been officially diagnosed with depression, adhd and anxiety. I am pretty sure I might also be bipolar, and have been tentatively, unofficially diagnosed bipolar by a couple of psychologists and psychiatrists over the past three years. I was prescribed a combination of Wellbutrin and Abilify once, and then Abilify again, on two separate occasions by different psychologists. 

However, my mom really really really doesn’t think I’m bipolar. I know this shouldn’t even matter as I am 24 years old, but my mom and I are extremely enmeshed.
She believes that I am not bipolar but simply highly sensitive and ADHD. Now, every time I go to a therapist or psychiatrist she ends up resenting them, and often coerces me into terminating, or convincing me that they really are “stupid” and don’t understand me. And anytime it’s suggested that I have anything other than ADHD anxiety and depression my mom won’t accept it. She is not opposed to all mental health care, and she herself is medicated for ADHD, but she is highly, highly against a bipolar diagnosis for me and even more against mood stabilizers and/or antipsychotics which have been prescribed to me.

I don’t push too hard on these issues anymore, partially because I myself now feel unsure as well, but also because I’m very afraid of upsetting her. Plus, I’m dependent on her right now (partly because of my mental health which has reduced my functioning). She can be volatile and unpredictable and these are her buttons so I am trying to avoid pushing them.

However the more I think about how my life is unraveling and what my future looks like (not good at all if things stay the same) the more I’m wondering if maybe I really am bipolar and medication will help as it seems to have helped so many other people. But I feel like I can’t pursue help in a direct or totally honest way  because I’m dependent on my mother and she insists and fully expects to be 100% involved and pretty much in control of my mental healthcare (and becomes very hostile if denied that right, citing the many instances in which I floundered horrifically because she wasn’t involved). I’m an only child, estranged from my father, and not close to any of my extended family, who are all religious fundamentalists anyway, and far worse candidates for a support network. 

I know I need to become more independent, starting with getting a driver’s license. But to blatantly disregard her wishes about my mental health care seems really scary and even impossible as stupid as that might sound. Maybe I just need a pep talk? I’m so scared of upsetting her but that is my own issue. 

Does anyone have any advice? I feel stuck right now and torn between what I know I should do and what I feel, in my bones, is the safest and most practical thing to do (put therapy/medication on the back burner, and just deal with my mental health it on my own like she wants me to, until I am independent).",youngadults,"Mom doesn’t think I’m bipolar, very against medication.

I obviously never expected that I'd turn out to be a demigod and go to Camp Halfblood, or become a wizard, or go Pokemon hunting, or accompany the avatar on wacky adventures or whatever. But it was drilled into my head that childhood, adolescence and young adulthood are the most magical times of your life, with beauty and meaning and adventure. It's strange to revisit the stories of characters I always thought of as so much older and more accomplished than me, and remember that they're like six or seven years younger than me in the book. It makes me feel like a lame grandma. 

It's not like I've lived under a rock for the past ten years, but I've struggled with depression, abuse at the hands of professionals, social isolation, and a serious feeling of disappointment in my youth. I never had that ""magic close friend group"" although I'd have liked to have one. I have close friends, but nothing ever like that. I've dated, but no amazing love stories.

It's kind of hard not to revisit my Pokemon games and Percy Jackson books, and all the stories I loved as a child, when I somehow envisioned that my coming of age stories would be similarly exciting and meaningful, and think ""That was it?"" 

It's like there's still some eleven-year old me sitting there inside of 21-year old me, expecting my life thus far to have been some YA-novel adventure. I don't know if this is the cult of youth messing with me or if I really am a disappointment.

Can anyone else relate to feeling underwhelmed by their ""coming of age"" not being as exciting as they thought it would be?",youngadults,"This is how I'd describe my quarter-life crisis, YA novel-style",0.0

To raise spirits, we are collaborating with our official Discord server to organize a Secret Santa event for all /r/youngadults users on both platforms.

&amp;nbsp;

Before I give you the submission form, let us address some concerns:

**Wait, doesn’t Reddit itself already do a secret santa? Why should I participate in yours?**

Reddit is a very wide platform with many many users who may not be as honest or willing to put in as much effort. By participating in a smaller, closer-knit community, you may potentially have a chance to match with those you are more familiar with or have spoken to before, and the likelihood of not receiving a gift is much lower!

**Yeah, right. How are you going to protect me from being scammed?**

All participants will be vetted individually by myself and volunteers on the Discord team to ensure they are actually members of our community. We also have a re-matching system, so in the event that your Santa fails to communicate that they are fulfilling their end of the bargain we can ensure you are reassigned a Santa who will!

**What about COVID? Is it really safe to be sending things potentially around the world?**

COVID is very much still a concern and we understand that users may be uncomfortable receiving items that may potentially have come in contact with somebody carrying COVID. That is why we have added the option to only receive digital gifts, if that is something you feel will ensure your safety. However, even if you are to opt-in for a physical gift, we encourage all participants to thoroughly sanitize any packages they receive!

**What if I use Discord and Reddit?**

No worries! The event will crossover with both, meaning that a Redditor may match with a Discord user or vice versa. If you use both platforms, simply put in a single application and put whichever username you prefer in your application (or both, if you so wish). All forms will be manually processed, so you don’t need to worry *too* much about messing up some formatting. Just make sure whichever name(s) you put are accurate!

**When would I receive my gift? When should I send mine?**

For digital gifts, as close to Christmas as you can. Shooting it over to them the morning of would work just fine, so long as you ensure you know their timezone! If you are shipping a physical item, you will want to shoot for December 9th to be right on time, December 15th at the *absolute latest*. Any later than that, and there may be a very high chance it will arrive late.

**What if something happens last minute and I am no longer able to participate?**

No problem! We would much rather you tell us as soon as possible, so we can help get your giftee something in your stead. We understand life happens and won’t be upset if you decide to opt out at any time for any reason. Just make sure you message a moderator and let them know!


**A few things to note:**

&gt;Reddit users’ accounts must be at least 2 months old with comment history showing activity in the /r/youngadults subreddit

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Discord users must have 100 messages sent in the server

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Participants must fill out a form below.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Participants must be 18 year old or older.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Santas sending physical gifts must send proof of shipping by Dec 15th at the absolute latest.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Gifts must be of $10 value unless it is a creative item such as a drawing

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;All gifts must be SFW!

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Failure to send a gift and/or communicate with the mod team will result in a permanent ban from the subreddit and/or the Discord server.

That is about all you need! If you have any questions or further concerns about this event, do not hesitate to message me or another moderator about it.

Thought I'd make this post to share everything I learned to help the younger ones on this sub:


- Prioritize your career over love, especially when you're young.


- Listen to older adults. Their experience can help you save time, money, and heartbreak.


- At the same time, realize people are limited by their own experiences and knowledge. Just because somebody tells you it can't be done, doesn't mean you should stop trying. 


- If you are lucky enough to have a caring family, keep them close. Never, ever put your family on the back burner. They will have your back even when everyone else leaves you.


- Value the people who care about you and show it to them instead of chasing after people who don't want you.

- You cannot make somebody fall in love with you by being nice to them.


- You cannot make somebody respect you by being nice to them.


- If something is bothering you, verbalize it. People cannot read your mind.


- Don't be overly competitive with your peers. ""Networking"" isn't just about getting along with older mentors. It's also about keeping good relationships with your peers and helping each other out in your time of need. Your peers will understand what you're going through better than anybody else. 


- Reach for opportunities even if they seem difficult/impossible for you. You will never regret failing, but you will always regret not trying.


- Try to have at least one hobby that you do not to impress others or make money, but just to make yourself happy. 


- Moisturize daily and use an electric toothbrush. 


- If you're feeling low energy, exercise or eat something.


- Laziness does not exist. Procrastination always has an underlying cause, usually anxiety or perfectionism. Find out what your cause is so you can handle it.


- Set **realistic** goals so you don't end up disappointed. 


- Be your own best friend. Fight for yourself and don't be afraid. People will respect you for it.


- Learn about yourself. Who are you, really? What drives you? What angers you? What depresses you? Figure out who you are first before you commit to a person.


- The first job you have is rarely ever what you'll end up doing for the rest of your life. Don't be afraid to seize good opportunities and leave jobs that do not fulfill you.


- Do not settle for less than you're worth...whether in love or in your career.",youngadults,What I learned in my early 20s,0.0

This “friend” left me alone- at the mall of Georgia, in Buford- by myself at 11:30pm. We had made plans to go to the trail of terror. She (a) came and picked me up at 6:30pm and we went back to her house to pick up our other friend (b). From her house, we went to b’s house which- I didn’t know why- but okay. At b’s house, I found out her MOM WAS GOING WITH US. okay, that’s fine but her mom makes me uncomfortable because she acts like a teenager... which she is not. I also found out that b’s “boyfriend” is coming along and he was someone I had never met! And he’s driving! 5 minutes after we get to b’s house, A starts throwing back fireball. 

(Side note... I don’t like alcohol. It’s not for me but if you want to drink that’s on you I just don’t care to be around it) 

This actually makes me angry and I’m really not in the mood to hangout. Reason 1, I’m going to be quiet around people I do not know that well. Especially if they make me uncomfortable. Reason 2, A knows I hate alcohol and she kept taking shot after shot after shot. I also don’t like who A becomes when she drinks so it just offset my mood but I don’t say anything because I never get to hangout with A &amp; B anyways so I just try to enjoy my night. 

Well, we are otw from B’s house, in Snellville (where my ex lives so yet another reason I’m not in the mood to hangout) to Buford which was a good hour drive. By the time we actually get in the car to go to the trail, it’s already 8:30pm. So by the time we get to the trail- it would have already been 10pm

AND A KNOWS I HAVE A CURFEW UNLESS I TALK TO MY MOM BEFOREHAND BUT I HAD NO IDEA WE WERE GOING TO BE OUT THAT LATE. 

Well, we get almost there and everyone wants to eat. B and I agree on steak and shake but everyone else wanted Wild Buffalo Wings, where you sit down. So I agree and we go there and A orders ANOTHER ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE and I’m just done at this point. by the time we get done eating- it’s 11pm and I have to be home in an hour and we haven’t even made it to the place yet. So A is trying to cheer me up and I’m like yo, I need to go home- my mom is going to be so mad. And she just said “I told you’re mom you were going to be out late” and I said she thought you were joking because you know I have a curfew and for you to just sit there and disrespect my moms wishes- like seriously???? 

Well A starts to ask me about our old friend group (A, C, D &amp; E) and then she gets to the point of her drunkenness where she gets all sensitive and starts blaming me and saying that we never hangout and that I need to quit bringing C &amp; D up because they chose to not be friends anymore. And I’m like this is exactly what I’m talking about like I don’t care to be around you when you get like this. 

And so she said “I guess you can call this friendship to and end” 

Gets in the vehicle with B, b’s mom and b’s boyfriend and drives away leaving me alone at the mall with no one around. The restaurant had already closed and I was sitting outside alone in the 30° cold. 

Luckily my sister came and got me but she was a good 30 minutes away. 

Anywayssss, I just want to know, do y’all think I should just end this friendship or try to reconcile? She has apologized but I didn’t hear from her FOR 2 DAYS AFTER IT HAPPENED. she betrayed me. She left me alone in the cold. I just don’t know what to do.",youngadults,Looking for advice... long post,0.0

Straight A’s top of the class in locked at school. However, im the more extroverted of us two and that’s saying a lot because I’m very much introverted myself. 

Anyway the only real trouble I’ve ever gotten in was when I was 16 and me and my friends were hungry at like 3am and went to go get food and my friend didn’t have his headlights on and we got pulled over and my parents flipped and have tracked me everyday since up until a month or so ago.

I’m 18 now and I’m college 3.5 hours away from home. I’ve been going with a girl from high school for nearly 3 years from now and the relationship between her and my parents has slowly degraded and it’s very much a head butting tongue biting situation now with them and her. 

But anyway I turned off the tracker app here recently like I said and immediately got calls and texts saying to turn it back on which of course I didn’t want to be tracked anymore so I told them that and things were fine for a bit. Also during this time my gf had met me halfway from home and I had picked her up and stayed with her in my college town a couple times and had planned to go down and see her for a few days without telling my parents. 

So long story short I get down there and of course my mom just happens to be coming up to my school the next day. So the next day I leave as soon as possible but she still beats me but I’ve told her that I’m doing school work. So I end up getting over to my sisters house late, she lives in the same city as my school, and they seem fine but it’s not long before my sister corners me and is asking me why my car wasn’t in the parking garage and of course I’m denying it. But they searched a four level parking garage car by car for my car. And I’m thinking this is crazy as hell. 

So anyway that happens and weeks go by and I’m gonna go home for my gfs birthday. So I go home a few days before my parents think I’m coming and stay with her at her house as a little bday treat and Friday I go to my house claiming I just got in. So fridays her bday and Saturday is Halloween, her favorite holiday so we’re together those days, and then Sunday comes along and low and behold there’s both my parents in my room early Sunday morning telling me they need to talk and I’m like alright what now. So my dad asks me when I got in Thursday night which I got in Tuesday actually but I denied this of course. But come to find out he had drove 25 minutes to my gfs house Friday morning for some reason and saw my car there so I got myself out of that just saying I came home earlier that day than what I told them. But anyway he continues on asking where I’ve been driving so much and I’m like what and come to find out he had got in my car and calculated the miles I’ve driven since my oil was changed right before I left for school and saw that there were extra miles from the trips I had made to pick her up halfway. So I lie my way out of that too and then he being super the tracker. And I tell them that I just don’t want to be tracked and of course they try the it’s just so we don’t worry and I’m shutting it down and my dad proceeds to tell me that if I don’t put it back on my phone that he will stop being for my school and will send me up there without a car. Now I appreciate everything they do for me but is this not ridiculous or am I just being a bad kid? And the worse part is that my sister who I’d really like to be able to talk to about this stuff is just as two faced as my parents and will run and tattle like she’s 12 not 26",youngadults,College freshman wondering if my parents are being ridiculous and any potential advice,0.0

I was really upset initially, but after a while I was kind of forced to re-think my reasons for wanting to go to grad school in the first place. When I applied, I had to submit a written statement outlining my career goals and how that specific master's program could help me reach them. Here's the thing though: I'm not really a goal-oriented person. I don't have any particular place I want to be in 10 years as long as I'm happy and financially stable. So my written statement included some really vague stuff about wanting to further my skills and be a better scholar. That was the only thing I *could* write without being totally untruthful. After being rejected, I decided I don't want to go to grad school right now (although I'm totally still willing to consider it in the future). 

My mom for some reason refuses to accept this. She keeps telling me that I only changed my mind because I'm afraid of getting rejected again (not true but she insists I'm wrong about my own feelings because she ""knows me""), she literally suggested I write to the dean of the schools I applied to and ask for reconsideration (I **will not** do that because it's entitled and rude and not how admissions work), and she seems genuinely disappointed that I've chosen to look for a job for now. She genuinely does not trust me to make my own decisions and I'm going crazy.

Hi,

I’m a 22 (F) who just recently graduated this year with a good amount of debt. I have a full time job in the arts field but it only pays 13 dollars an hour and therefore I’m partially financially dependent on my parents. I live in a cheap studio by myself and take care of my full rent and they help out with food (give me around $80 a week), electricity, and WiFi and my medical bills. They’ve recently asked me to cover the electricity and WiFi myself and some of my doctor visits since I have a ton of medication bills. Would you consider this fair? They previously agreed to help me pay for my bills until at least my boyfriend moves in with me next year but it seems like they continue to help less and less as each month goes on. I’m close to them otherwise and they do offer emotional support as well so I guess I’m just wondering if they’re doing the right thing or I’m expecting too much from them?

I'm asking this question to men mainly because, well, we're usually the ones to grow beards and stuff, but I don't wanna make anyone feel excluded, I'd  happy  as well to receive advice from anyone.

The problem is I'm considering this option because my face doesn't look that great because of the folliculitis I get every time I shave. However, if I choose to remove my facial hair with laser, it won't ever grow back again and I'd be missing on the opportunity to maybe be able to grow a beard somewhere in the future.

I'm 20yo, and can barely grow a beard, so it's not like it's gonna happen anytime soon. But it still makes me wonder if it's worth taking the treatment and saying goodbye to that possibility or if I should just suck on it and keep shaving the traditional way.

I'd like to know what would you guys do in my situation? What do you think I should do? Have you had received laser treatment already? How was it? 

I don't know what to do, I'm planning on consulting with a dermatologist first, but I feel like they'll just recommend the treatment so I can buy their treatment.

 I hear stories about my boss just being mean to employees over small things that wasn't there fault.

I had to go out and buy some of my own tools because the company took 2 weeks to get the essential tools for my job which cost me 500 dollars out of my already shallow pockets.

Living in the city has just made me mad because its a place I dont know and im being thrown in there like I've lived there my whole life and the drivers there are scary like once we get some real snow I dont feel like  it would be a very stess free environment since everybody is so get up and go there its scary. I also don't injoy the benefits of the city like having every store or entertainment activity around me, I just don't use them or want to go out.

If I move back home it will be cheaper and I wouldn't need to deal with a bigger company so I wouldn't need to drive my own car. I would be closer to friends and family also.

before I moved to the UK from Hungary for Uni last year, I was working at an IKEA restaurant as a college/high scholl or whatever (9th to 13th grade school) student for one and half years after having had my internship at the television station, and while being a well booked, demandful photographer because I needed every penny to be able to move to the UK without my parents' support.

I liked working at IKEA as a student, three days a week, (30 hours). I loved the people, the atmosphere and having a close bond group I can work with. I was well appreciated and people liked the way I work.

I quickly became a front of house cook without any former food industry experience, and absolutely no ambitions in catering but I was hgad they trusted me this much. It's a rare thing to get this position as a student.


I moved to the UK after 1,5 years at IKEA and after a year spent there I had to move back to Hungary. This brings me to this year.

I'm currently back at IKEA for my 5th month since coming home. I'm front of house cook again and currently getting trained for new positions. I've been employee of the month, my pay is okay and I still love my co-workers.

And they still appreciate my work and are extremely chuffed that I'm back.

However.....

I hate the food industry. I always felt like it might not be my thing but now I'm sure as hell that I have nothing to do with food preparation and cooking for 10K people a day.....

I feel like burning out.

I haven't had much luck in the creative field lately either. 

The thing is tho that I like my jobmates way too much to leave them and I never felt this important before. I was never of this much respect anywhere. I have trained newcomers, I reached milestones that others had to work several more years for.

I take pride on all kinds of work I'm doing no matter how much I want to be in the field or not. Work is work and I'm doing my best regardless. And they know it, and they appreciate it.


I don't know whether I should change jobs, look for something new because even if I find a better opportunity as a creative practician I feel like I will miss my co-workers too much and I won't be treated  this well and trusted this much again.

Especially that I'm only staying i  Hungary for 10 more months before moving back to the UK.

Should I stay at IKEA doing my best for 10 months, finish Uni, and find a job in my field after I finally have my papers and proper certificates?

Or should I say YOLO, find something and care about money and relevnat experience, rather than the atmosphere?

Again, I'm 21 and I have 10 months till I move countries so this is not a post about long term choices.

Thanks if you read it through. I know it's a lot.

I hope you a have an amazing day!",youngadults,Should I change my job? I feel like burning out at 21 but then I feel like I'm just an impostor believing that this is what burning out feels...,0.0

My name is Rose. I’m 22 years old, just graduated college 2 months ago. I have started my own successful business from scratch and so far so good in terms of “income.” However, I want to use my degree, because I love what I studied. 

Here’s the problem.

I can’t find a job in my state, it’s been hard but I’ve gotten many many opportunities/offers all over the US. So what’s the problem? 

I’m nervous, anxious, I feel lost. I have zero friends, my dumped me a year ago, I live with family for now and well, I’m just scared.

Scared to see what’s out there and I was NEVER like this. I have always wanted to explore the world and just take it by the balls. But now that the job offer is on the table, and I would have to move across the country for a job, without knowing anyone, finding a place to stay, etc. it’s so much to handle, I know I can do it but something about moving across the country for a job alone scares me. 

I guess because I had my life planned out with my ex.. where we were going to move in together, and travel for a job if we needed to.. I just feel so lost..
