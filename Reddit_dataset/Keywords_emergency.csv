(i'm pansexual and questioning if i'm agender or genderqueer)other prejudices--thinking people can reade her mind-any one in customer service is stupid/ she can be rude and expect they'll still be nice-everyone wants the best for her-shell do good for you and expect she can treat you like shit later but it's okay because she did something for you that you never needed or asked for (i get it's nice but ie: buying say a coffee and then saying something like im a burden in her life)other problems:-thinking i make her yell and get angry and upset when she does it to herself because she's very opinionated and i don't have control over say the guy pumping our gas or that i say forgot something that was her responsibility like not missing a gas station she passes while driving -she is financially abusive because i can't even keep ahold of my own money without her threatening me in the way of say not letting me see my friends**i need to see my friends because i need a break from being at home. i've gotten so depressed from not seeing them before they've become one of the only things that keeps me afloat abuse-verbally abusive and things she says is scary: ""all liars should die"" ""when you and (her bf) are sick next i'll fucking 'chicken soup you' and then you'll croak"" ""do you blow your bf with that mouth"" ""you're a fucking whore"" (i broke up with one bf and four months later found someone else i wanted to date) that also ties into  emotional abuse- she guilt trips me all the time and says she can do things because she's an adult even if it's ridiculous- physical abuse: she says away from this because she's been physically beaten belt style when young but she has still whipped a belt at me before, grabbed me, pulled my hair, slapped me with a metal ruler and threatened me in various ways including to crash a car while we're in it. nothing has been enough to leave a scar and mostly just to sting and be red for a bit ---also physically abusive to my things like destroying a 150$ tablet that was my last christmas gift from my father who is too disabled to know what time of day it is or what 1 plus 1 isdestroyed a government provided trac phone (bc low income)destroyed another phone (150$) that was a gift to me *** i can't have any privacy she if she wants to needs to be able to read through my texts and i can't have social media without her knowing (so she doesn't know about this account) because she'd want me to explain everything but do the adult thing where she doesn't actually listen and expect me to keep answering the same question. she'd question why i post anything or who people are and want to control everything - parenting is basically from the 50's like anything that happens in the house stays in the house (even if you want to kill yourself which i have because if this environment)- therapy is for insane people- mental health doesn't exist you're either okay and sane or you have a illegal problem that needs to be locked up (but it's okay for her to have anxiety which no one can say she has just her or shell tell at you)-bizzare weird things that just make me uncomfortable: she think she can just into the bathroom when i'm taking a piss or a shower even if i'm naked and want privacy -she will go to the bathroom if i'm say washing my face even though we have a second one -she keep telling at me to get out if the bathroom because she needs to go even if i do even though we have a second one-shell just be naked like say after a shower and say i'm in the bathroom doing something even though it's not a sight i want to see without warning-she pushes her way into all my doctors and everything appointments and doesn't understand no matter how many times people tell her what patients rights are and i have to have my doctors and what not just straight up lie to her it's that badi've sprinkled examples of her weirdness and how she's abusive and controlling and unsupportive.-------------------------------------------------------------***some things about me:i have depression and anxiety that have been clinical and even lead me to emergency services and therapy. i have indulged in self harm and binge drinking as a suicide attemptthis ties into why dcf didn't remove me because they couldn't see past the cutting and drinking even though i'd tell them why. this isn't all my problems but it strongly ties into my concerns and why i posted this:because of my legal history for stealing from my house and consumption of alcohol and past mental health outburst (going on 4 years ago) does this affect when i turn eighteen to go and not had my parents know anything. i plan on not signing anyway medial rights besides if i'm not able to give consent to medical procedures if i say get in a car crash and need surgery but can't respond. i won't give them financial power either. i need to know what i should do when i'm eighteen like how to get medical insurancei only work part time and make massachusetts minimum wage for 12 hours with a week's pay of 149$i do not have my lisence just a permitobviously no cari don't want to burden my friends parents too much even though i might stay with someone for a bit.--she would literally call all my friends and their parents and the police department when i'm eighteen as if they could do something about getting me back in the housei'm currently 17 turning eighteen in june just after high school graduationplanning on going to college for four yearsi'm mentally stable now despite my disordersi need to get out of my house if possible on the day i'm eighteensome complications include: -not having a car or licence-not having a lot of money -no siblings -no family to take me in-going to college soon-place to live/storage-i am adopted and the most official document i have is going to be my passport coming in. we had to give up my permanent resident card to give the okay that i'm actually a citizen (american parents adopting foreign children on touch her down of the plane in america = usa citizen but we had no official document )(i'd need to steal all my papers that i don't know where all of them are in the house)-when i leave if i don't take my pocessions insecret i might get physically asulted",7,1,"I need help when I'm eighteen (""running away"")",Adult
70,"firstly, i am sorry that you have been victimized.  it sucks.before anything else, if you are a victim of a crime and are in a situation that is dangerous to your life or safety, get somewhere safe, then file the report.once you are safe, it is important to report it to the police as quickly as possible.  either by calling 911 (in an emergency situation) or your local non-emergency police number (for most non-emergency situations, like: identity theft, car break-ins (with the suspect long gone) and other property related crimes of that nature). also, please understand that 911 calls and non-emergency calls get dispatched out by a priority system.  the general rule is life before property.  so if you have been the victim of a burglary, but the burglary has already happened and the suspect is long gone, then the police response will be superseded if an accident with injuries or an assault call comes in at the same time.even if you don’t think the crime that occurred to you is important in the grand scheme of things (like your car was entered into, but nothing was damaged and nothing was stolen), it is still advisable to make a police report because that helps your local police investigate similar crimes and direct their manpower to “hot-spots” to help reduce crime.depending on the type of crime you are reporting, you can make it over the phone or an officer will actually meet with you in person.  even if you have evidence (like video of the suspect), if the crime is a low priority, the department may have their officers generate the report with you over the phone and then allocate a follow up investigation with a detective. (which would be the person you really want to view the evidence.  if the crime is something that a uniform officer handles all the way through, then ask that officer on the phone what the best way is to get them the evidence.  if the officer responds in person, just give them the evidence then).when you do file a police report try to remember the “five w’s”.  we understand that you will not always be able to answer all the “ws” but everything you can answer helps.who – who is the suspect?  who is the victim?  is the suspect known or are they strangers?  describe the suspect (try to be as detailed as possible – gender, skin color (this goes beyond just race because skin pigments can vary greatly) height, weight, clothing, scars-marks-tattoos, odd ways of talking.)  is the suspect armed?  does the suspect have a vehicle?  describe the vehicle…what- what actually happened to make you call the police?  not the long drawn out backstory, but what happened today (or the day the crime occurred).  do you have direct knowledge of what happened or are you calling for someone else?  be detailed when describing what the suspect did or is doing.  if you are calling in suspicious activity, be specific. (green man walking in my neighborhood = not specific.  purple man is walking in my neighborhood and he keeps looking in different vehicles and trying to open doors = a good example of suspicious activity).  if you are the victim of a theft, what was taken?  describe the item.  do you have pictures of it?  serial numbers?...where- where did the crime occur?  did it happen in the same place you are calling from?  if it happened elsewhere, then you may need to be diverted to a different police department who has jurisdiction over the actual incident location….when- when did the crime occur?  if it happened yesterday, why are you calling today?  be prepared to explain any big delay in why you reported the crime.  it is okay to sometimes be unsure if you want to make a report, but be prepared to get asked that question.  if you can give a very specific time frame for a crime, it helps the police in their investigations and allocation of man-power…why- this is not victim blaming.  but, in certain circumstances, you will be asked “why” you are the victim of a crime.  if you know the suspect and he robbed you, do you know why he robbed you?  are y’all having a dispute over money or love or something else?  why also gives us motive.  it helps us understand why you were targeted if it is not a random crime…how- how did the suspect commit the crime against you?  if you are the victim of a burglary, how did they get into your house?  how did they exit your house?  if you are the victim of an assault, how did they assault you?  if you are the victim of financial card fraud, how did they get your information (if you know)?  how did they get your card’s pin? …the above are just examples of the types of questions that need to be answered with the “5 ws”.  of course, there are many many more examples especially when you start breaking police reports down by specific crimes.so, you have filed a police report and want to know what happens next.  it depends on the crime, on the police department and sometimes what you want done.  some departments have uniform officers handle low level investigations and dole out the higher priority stuff to detectives.   generally speaking, if your case needs further investigation it will get assigned to a detective.  if you need an update for your case, try and call the department (with your case number handy) and ask for the detective division that handles your particular type of crime.  from there, ask for the detective assigned to your case.  most uniform officers only handle the initial report, so trying to call them may not be worthwhile and instead it is advised to try and get in touch with the investigative element of your local police department.  the detective assigned to your case will be the one you deal with most of the time, if it is a case that will be investigated further.at the end of the day, the more information you can give during the initial police report (and subsequent follow-ups with your detective- like bank statements, receipts, serial numbers etc…) the better chances a successful investigation can be conducted on your behalf. this post is already long enough so i will end it here with plans on doing more specific types of 101’s in the future.  i hope this helped at least one person.",3,21,"So, you’re the victim of a crime and need to file a police report…",Adult

865,"hi allso this time last year i got myself a credit card solely for the purpose of upping my credit score. i’ve had a phone contract for a good few years and started paying car insurance etc 2 years ago (i’ve been told they give you a credit history, yes?), and even though my mum’s always said “never get a credit card!” i figured the extra boost wouldn’t hurt. i’m typically pretty good with money so haven’t had to use it very much, despite the fact the company gave me quite a bit of credit to play with 😅  i’ve kept a pretty small balance (don’t think i’ve ever owed more than 25%) on the card for the year to keep the card “active”, occasionally paying off larger purchases immediately and always paying more than the minimum monthly payment.the main pro of this particular card was the introductory rate of 0% interest, but that will be changing in roughly 3 weeks time, and i’m wondering what move to make.on the one hand, close the card, but i believe that will negatively affect my credit score in some way? correct me if i’m wrong.alternatively, i keep the card but im not sure of the best way to use it? i can always use my debit card without a second thought as i’m in a good position financially for all my outgoings at the moment. would it be beneficial to keep the card, making one purchase each month and paying it off immediately (which i assume means i don’t pay any interest? sorry if i’m dumb haha) or is it fine to just keep the card and not use it unless for an emergency?frankly i just don’t want to be paying out more than i need to, and with my credit score being in the excellent category on experian now, i’m not concerned about getting that little boost anymore, but i also don’t want it to go down 😅thanks for reading",1,1,Credit Score advice,Adult

1007,"two weeks ago i was fat shamed at an event held by my gym. i have been struggling so hard to get it out of my head and move the fuck on. i’m 30. i came up reading and worshiping fashion magazines and sickly thin celebrities before the world knew what photoshop was or body positivity was embraced. needless to say, i’m completely fucking jaded. i try to look in the mirror and in my favorite drag queen voice say “girl, you are fucking fierce” and snap my fingers, but that nasty little voice deep down in my psyche counters that little bit of self love with a “fuck you, girl. you know you fucking ugly and what the fuck is that inflatable tube around your waist? you are fat. you are worthless”. the tender skin on my left forearm bears a scarred “f”, and artifact left over from when i carved “fat” into my arm when i was in the eighth grade. i have never been clinically diagnosed, but i do believe  i suffer from body dysmorphia disorder, among other things. i’m a stubborn fucking irishman and i don’t do therapy. i am completely obsessed with how i look and how other people think of me. i get depressed in dressing rooms when items are labeled as my standard size, but i can’t get them up past my plus size thighs. don’t even get me started on being fit for my bridesmaid dress for my best friends wedding; i saw my measurements and i nearly had a fucking fit that wanted to include tearing the dress to shreds. anyways. i attended what was supposed to be a fun, community centered, trivia night hosted by my local gym, which, however, prides itself on being inclusive of all types of people of all walks of life. it was a friday night, i hadn’t had a chance to eat dinner, and i smoked a bowl with my girlfriend, so i had the munchies. the snacks that were provided were mini candy bars and chips...i helped myself. one of the trainers at my gym was seated at my table. backstory on her; beautiful, perfect body, beautiful woman, but very calculated and cold personality. i can’t figure her out and always get weird vibes. i attend her classes because they are challenging and i feel good about what i have accomplished when i leave. i have a very outgoing and bubbly personality and am always well received by my gym buddies, especially on the trivia night. the trainer had seated herself far away from the fun and looked her usual self, miserable. when the game began, she moved to my table which was also occupied by many of my gym peers. all was well and good until i noticed her side eying my candy wrapper pile. i immediately felt uncomfortable and sensed something unpleasant was going to come out of her mouth. trainer: “nicole, when is your wedding date?” me, screaming internally: “okay, bitch. fuck you. i know where you are headed and i’m not fucking here for it” me, in real life, sinking into my chair, and shuffling the candy wrappers: “june, 2019” trainer, eying my torso and candy wrappers, oozing with judgement: “well, when are you going to get serious about your training?” fuuuuucccckkkkkk you, bitch. in front of my gym peers?!? really? you don’t know me. you don’t know that i am fully fucking aware of the fact that i’m stuffing my face with junk food and it’s not going to help me fit into my wedding dress. i fucking know. i’m aware. i felt shamed. i felt judged and angry and it made me sad. i now know that she thinks i’m fat, and i’m so bothered by it. cut to this week. i came down with a bad bout of bronchitis that ended me up in the emergency room. i feel weak and fat and disgusting. i had to text the gym trainer to ask her to cover my class that i teach (yeah, i fucking volunteer teach and people love my class) because of my illness. instead of just being kind and saying “get better soon”, she asks me, again, when am i going to get serious about my training for the wedding!?!?!?!?! bitch, when i can breathe again. i am truly fucking engulfed in the shame she had made me feel. i want to tell her this, but she’s just so cold, i feel like i’ll just embarrass myself. i also don’t want to let her into my private life. she’s not worthy of knowing anything about me. i suppose i’m just rambling now. perhaps some of you can relate. i wish i could just not care about what other people think of me. it’s like a god damn cross to bear.

(not messing with this woman's grades...)  i was still just trying to stay calm because i didn't know what it was. after i told kalyn (sister) she informed me she has a friend who is an ophthalmologist assistant, she was able to get me in friday for an emergency appointment, now keep in mind i don't have insurance so my sister and i had to pay out of pocket and thanks to her friend it was cheaper then it could have been but we had to wait till friday, so i worked thursday and didn't say anything to anyone because i didn't know my sister had accepted the appointment. i was just still freaking out about (what i was hoping wasn't a tumor (my dad just beat lymphoma go dad!) and stressing about telling my sister and how she would react. i knew it may need to been seen immediately but i figured if it's medical related my boss wouldn't mind. i'm also a very anxious person by nature and have been stressing about my car, now my health and tossing my boss in the mix is just mean...so i see the dr who tells me my right meibomian glad was swollen and it could be caused from a number of things but generally leads to an immune deficiency. so now i have to get blood drawn next week and i have a ct scan set for nov 1st and a follow up with my dr on nov 30.thursday night after i got off work kalyns friend said my appointment was at 930am i texted my boss i will go in 930 i was not sure when i will be done but i will come back to work as soon as i was able. he replied telling me i needed to be to be back by 2pm which was fine. plenty of time, after everything was said and done with my appointment my sister dropped me off at work. now let me say i was already apprehensive to go into work because my boss has a tendency to lecture me about how i am unreliable anytime i call in or ask to come in late. so i show up around 1:35 explain to him whats happening/give him the dr's note and inform him that i will need to do blood testing next week. the first thing he says is to make sure it's on my day off. i agree and said i intended to-to which he asked to have a meeting in his office. the meeting was him explaining that me requesting and taking days off means he has to cover my shifts and i should see that as somewhat embarrassing to have my boss cover my shifts. he is the only other receptionist at his business besides me. i've worked for him for 6 months and he said i have asked for 2 weeks total off. a week of it was requested before employment and he admitted, 3 days was a request to visit my dad while he started radiation, one was a free snow day he gave me and the other three would be sick days or days i'm counting of me showing up to work, leaving to do something and returning to finish my shift. i was also bawling through all of this. the last thing he asked/said to me before i told him i was done talking to him and walked out was "" i've noticed your lack of enthusiasm to work here lately, is it because you're looking for another job?""  i just feel exhausted and used. i'm responsible for my person and as such i decided to quit to be able to worry about my health. fuck you james.&amp;#x200b;that's it, give me insurance info, anything would be helpful. i don't know what it is or even if i'm sick, maybe it's something simple. can a uti can cause this? that'd be neat. either way thank you. should i post this in a different subreddit?",5,1,Health Insurance help life dump/venting,Adult

4185," hey /rlifeprotips!**forward:** recently saw a post about family member who had a stroke and related ""tips"". i think it started a really good conversation but saw a lot of people had questions still about different situations. in this post i am going to try and summarize what i know as a hcp, what i have learned from paramedics, drs, dispatchers and personal experience helping those i know in emergency situations. some of these have been mentioned in part elsewhere on reddit. i couldn't find something as broad and applicable as i know. i hope this helps people and give them options that work for them!in my (and many professionals opinion) the two best things you can do are **be prepared!** and **take a first aide class!** at end are options i use/would consider if i was living/working in another country.**1) i need 911 but i am struggling to call and i am alone!!!!****ok! this is a huuuuuge one! the best answer for each individual is going to vary. i am going to list a bunch of options. different ones are going to work for different individuals.****a) call 911 from a land line if you have one or one available.** if your option is a cellphone it will work! (it will just take the dispatcher a min (literally no longer then a min) longer to determine your location or best guess (info about when in car later). all functioning payphones should allow you to call emergency services at no charge. if it is a public use pay phone in an area like a street wait by that phone! if it is a home phone attempt to communicate with the dispatcher as best you can. whisper, use clipped sentences, tap phone receiver for yes no questions. these people when in doubt will send emergency medical services and police to find you, assist you and (if the situation appears to be one were someone was unable to breath/talk) police as well so that if you are trapped in your home they can can enter the home/get through locked doors. yes they will bust down doors if the situation warrants it.so! if you are calling from a phone in your home or other public area (land line or cell phone) step 2 is get yourself were they can find you! sit on your front door step (unlock your door and sit in your front entry way with door open and blankets/coats on you if too cold out). if you are in an apartment do the best you can. ideal is for you to make it to the main entrance. take the route that works best (elevator, stairwell closest to your unit) ems will sweep up to where they and dispatch determine you are. if you are calling on a cell bring it with you.for public areas go where people can see you. nod ""yes"" or use other non-verbal communication tools. don't stay hiding in the bathroom! please! you will be hard to find! people won't know what to do and will be afraid to help because of privacy or bias. if you need help you need to go where you can find it! where people can see you and call 911 if you collapse. we also need space to assess you, help you, do rescue maneuvers etc! (there are reasons nurses/ems knock and barge in on people not answering when they are in the bathroom! or refuse to let you be alone when you are very ill/unstable! the amount of people we have picked up off bathroom floors is too damn high!)**b) did you know your phone has emergency resources on it!** regulation has made them pretty much universally applicable. occasionally how they operate is slightly different (sorry apple users it's usually you). these resources include ways you can ""ping"" emergency services (on pretty much all of them it's press your ""lockscreen"" button 5 times rapidly, provide information to responders such as allergies, important past medical history (like type 1 or 2 diabetic, heart/lung problems), if you are an organ donor etc, that can impact your care and what is safe to give you. it also provides options to program in ""next of kin""/emergency contact info. use it! if you are unconscious and a savvy first responder finds your phone and wallet we can use it to get the info we need and get in contact with those we need too. the emergency contact features will allow strangers to make 911 calls with your phone if they don't have one and/or call your next of kin if you or someone already has!samsung users learn [here](https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ans00050849/). android/google users [here](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9319337?hl=en). apple [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/ht208076). for peeps with others the info is out there, please find it and utilize! these systems are pretty universal now and function in multiple countries. they should automatically switch to the most applicable ems/dispatch number. if you are travelling in strange remote/rural communities you may come across a border sign that says ""in case of emergency call #. if it is not the country one (911/999/etc) it is because that municipality/region specifically for reasons you probably don't know and may or may not be good doesn't recognize 911/999 calls and you have to phone that number specifically. i haven't seen one for 25yrs myself. i hope they are all gone now and people got with the program.**c) in advance/prep for emergency** also have important info in your wallet/on your fridge. have healthcare #'s and insurance cards. keep lists of allergies, past medical history (pmhx), medications you currently or commonly use. ems and healthcare professionals (hcps) will look for these things when we cannot communicate with you or get reliable information. for other things like er registration a healthcare card and pmhx will give us something to compare and verify with to ensure we have the right person, right hx/medication, which will enable us to provide better care.**yes! please write if you use even tylenol and advil as needed the doses you use and roughly how often when you have pain!** any herbal/topical products (i can make you very ill/much worse if you use st john's wort, melatonin, otc remedies that have antiplatelet/anticoagulant like effects and more.) **we will attempt as best possible to determine if you took anything or if anyone gave you anything. if, to the best of our knowledge it has not been given and it is safe to do so/situation warrants it we will give it to you**. in certain situations (at least in canada) we can even do so before we have a dr order under certain protocols and guidelines. **if we don't give you anything yet it is for a good reason! likely, we could kill you if we give you something before we know more!** plus if you are the type of person who rubs themselves down in copious amounts of voltaren i need to double glove before i touch you :p i will live if accidents happen but i would like my skin not to break out and fall off while i help you. thanks in advance.**d)** **if 911/999/dispatch tells you to take or give something to yourself/someone do so as best as you are able.** they are following a best practice guideline and we want to get something on board that is more likely to harm you then hurt you (good example is asa during a heart attack) **if they say do not eat/drink/take anything listen!** it is because a risk is present that in which doing so will likely cause more harm/life threatening issues (most commonly aspiration) and a hcp needs to assess you first. **if you think you can't wait because you are soooo thirsty stop! don't do it! tell us you feel that way!** we will be mean and still not feed you but it triggers alarm systems in our brains that you may be suffering blood loss/acute kidney injury/going septic. these are major medical emergencies that eating/drinking before we do further tests will put you at a lot of risk if we don't do things right. **yes, you will be triaged higher. no, it's not a good thing! yes, you are more likely to be in the hospital for at least 6 hours.** we want to make sure you won't drop dead before we let you leave.if you have to stay in hospital and we often want to continue things like melatonin, vitamins etc. we need to know about them first though.**but what if i am in a car!!!

8149,"since the new year is approaching, i figured i'd create a challenge for you all!i'm already in a very similar process at the moment (i post a progress post on my profile every day if you want to check it out). the reason i say this is to say that the purpose of this post is simply to give you all some ideas on ways you can improve yourselves in 2021. the power of incremental improvement is amazing.**january: setting a wake-up time*** the four pillars of health are sleep, fitness, healthy eating, and having a good social life. let's work on fixing your sleep first. before focusing on a consistent sleep-time, it is key to work on waking up at the same time every day. you get to pick a time, but make sure that it is relatively early. 8 am is an excellent choice, for example.**february: setting up a seep time*** now that you are consistently waking up at the same time every day, you might have noticed that you might be tired some days. this is because your sleep time might not be consistent. 8 hours of sleep is a good target, but if you feel that it is too much or too little you can change it. your goal here is to be in bed at the same time every night. it might help to also set a time for when you need to get ready for bed. a night routine might take time and shouldn't be rushed.**march: performing deep work*** now that your sleep is fixed, you might notice that you have plenty of extra time during the day. you will use this time to indulge in at least 1 hour of deep work per day. deep work is defined as an activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. writing, studying, and coding are some examples. you can also spend your time producing your own content. the book ""deep work"" talks in detail about deep work, and the difference between deep work and shallow work.**april: hitting the gym*** now that your sleep is fixed and you're working on your brain muscles, it's time to start working on your actual muscles. the goal here is to go to the gym 3-5 days per week and perform strength training. the book ""bigger leaner stronger"" is a great book that talks about this and provides a workout routine. also, don't forget to stretch after your workouts! we don't want you getting injured.**may: doing cardio*** now that you've successfully worked on creating the habit of working on your muscles 3-5 days a week, the next goal is to add cardio into the mix. you can do this after your workouts or you can do it during your rest days. cardio can include running, swimming, hiking or even walking. the goal is to have 2 sessions per week. hiit is also a good example of cardio. a good idea might be to do hiit one day and to do low intensity cardio another day.**june: eating healthy*** wow, look at all your progress. you're going to bed at the same time every night, you're waking up early every day, and you're working on your brain and on your physical muscles. now it's time to focus on what you're putting into your body. you will start eating healthy every day. less carbs, more fruits and vegetables, no deep fried food, no unnatural foods, no unhealthy preservatives, no soft drinks, lots of protein... the list goes on. furthermore, you are to drink at least 2 litters of water per day, as water is also a big part of nutrition. there is a lot of information online about what constitutes as healthy eating. the book mentioned above is a good example. you can still eat food that tastes good. chipotle, for example, tastes amazing. another example is dark chocolate. you can by all means have a couple pieces of dark chocolate with your tea. the more proper research you do, the more you'll understand what is healthy and what isn't. the goal for this month is to implement a healthy lifestyle.**july: taking social risks*** the first three pillars of health have already been talked about. now it's time to do something about your social life. your goal here is to take 1 social ""risk"" per day. this can be something as simple as texting an old friend and asking if they would like to have a phone call to catch up. this can be something like asking a cute girl/guy if they would like to get coffee with you. this can be something like sending an email to an old professor and asking how they've been. this can be something like asking your friends if they'd like to hang out during the weekend and setting up a plan. the goal here is to get busy socially and to get in contact with more people.**august: teeth care*** wow congrats! you are a healthy person now. you are working on strength training and cardio every week. you are eating healthy. you have an amazing sleep schedule. you have an awesome social life. you are performing deep work every day on projects you find interesting. next up, it's time to work on preventing future health problems. the best way to start this is by working on your teeth. the goal here is to brush your teeth properly twice a day and to floss once per day. you can watch videos on youtube if you'd like or you can set up an appointment with your dentist. you are to no longer half-ass your teeth care. i want you to have the cleanest set of teeth out of everyone.**september: skin care*** there is a great subreddit on the topic of skin care on reddit. the three pillars of a beginner routine are to have a good moisturizer, to have a good cleanser and to have a good suncream. you are to go to that subreddit and learn how to create your beginners' routine with those three products. then you are to purchase those products and apply them every day in the manner that is set out in your routine.**october: meditating*** wow look at you! 9 amazing habits so far. you have transformed into a better version of yourself. but you're not done yet. next, we will work on calming your brain by meditating every day. there are some great meditation apps, such as headspace and calm available. the goal is to divide the month into 4 parts. the first week, you do 5 minutes of meditation per day. the second week, 10 minutes. third week, 15 minutes. finally, on the last week of the month you do 20 minutes per day. after the month is over you can return back to doing at least 5 minutes per day moving forward.**november: limiting phone use*** the next goal is to limit instant gratification. we live in a world where we are constantly plugged into the internet and into our smartphones. the best way to tackle this issue is by starting with what that is often most used, and most unhealthy - your smart phone. you are to set a 1 hour limit for each day (unless of course you absolutely need to use it for work or for an emergency or something). the point is to limit the use of apps such as youtube, instagram and things of that nature on the smartphone. you can spend your new time on things like reading or other hobbies.**december: helping people*** look at you! you have become a healthy individual. now it's time to help others! you are to perform one act of ""helping"" per day. this can be something as simple as giving money to a homeless person. you could also go on subreddits that talk about depression and suicide, for example, and direct message a user who is going through a hard time. there are numerous ways we can be kind and help others. your help and kindness must be genuine here. you goal is to take a little bit of time every day to be kind and to help someone.**final thoughts:*** it's amazing how much progress can be made in one year simply by focusing on one habit per month and then by adding a new habit the following month. there are many other habits that i wish i could have fit into this 12-month plan, but i believe these 12 are the most important for people just starting out. there is, however, one habit that needs to be mentioned. this is the habit of taking care of your finances. during the year, when you are focusing on the 12 habits mentioned above, make sure to keep this one in mind. make sure that you are being smart about your purchases and that you are learning about money management, and things like investing and saving. with that being said, i wish you all all the best in this journey! remember that you don't need to use this exact plan laid out. you can make your own changes. i can't wait to see you come out the other end of 2021 as improved individuals!",32,1,LPT: How to Change Your Life in 1 Year by Focusing on 1 Habit per Month,Adult

803,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/joe-biden-labor-workers-rights-unions-wagesoon after joe biden is inaugurated as the next us president, he is expected to take several strong steps on the labor front aimed at reversing or remedying the policies of donald trump – who promised workers a lot and delivered little.but biden’s number one priority will be to tackle the issues left in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.healthcare to the electoral college: seven ways 2020 left america exposedrobert reichrobert reichread morebiden’s nominee for secretary of labor, marty walsh – the mayor of boston and before that a labor leader for decades – is likely to help advance biden’s promises to help unions expand. walsh, who had headed boston’s federation of building trades unions, is expected to support increased spending on infrastructure to upgrade roads and bridges, strengthen the economy and create good-paying jobs. as mayor, he pushed for construction contractors to hire more workers of color.with covid-19 still raging across the us, many job safety experts say it’s urgent for biden to do something that the trump administration has failed to do: issue nationwide regulations directing businesses to take specific steps to protect their workers from the coronavirus, whether retail, restaurant, factory or construction workers.trump’s business-friendly occupational safety and health administration (osha) repeatedly rejected labor unions’ pleas to adopt such safety standards.“clearly priority one is an emergency standard for osha dealing with covid and equally a focused, full-on press on inspections, enforcement and guidance. it means doing everything osha hasn’t been doing,” said david weil, a top labor department official under barack obama. “ultimately the only way we’ll get public safety and reopening is if we get worker safety.”weil, now the dean at brandeis university’s heller school for social policy, said osha under biden should get far tougher than trump’s osha in holding employers accountable for failing to take steps to minimize covid. many worker advocates were dismayed by the modest fines that trump’s osha assessed, for instance, a $13,494 penalty against smithfield’s pork-processing plant in sioux falls, south dakota, where at least 1,294 workers contracted covid. smithfield’s parent company had revenues of $24.1bn last year.biden has signaled he will take many other pro-worker actions.although trump held himself out as a champion of workers, he did nothing to raise the minimum wage or enact paid leave, while biden has repeatedly called for a $15 minimum wage and guaranteeing workers 12 weeks’ paid family and medical leave. biden has also backed far-reaching legislation that would make it easier to unionize, and his appointees to the national labor relations board (nlrb) are likely to reverse many trump labor board decisions that made it harder for workers to join unions.steven pitts, a longtime labor economist at the university of california, berkeley, said biden should pursue two sets of labor policies. “one is try to raise and protect labor standards like a higher minimum wage and tougher safety rules,” he said. “second is to build worker power into policy. too often we focus on the former and not the latter.”biden has indicated he will seek to build worker power by strengthening unions. on election day eve, campaigning in western pennsylvania, he promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen”. in his campaign platform, biden endorsed the protecting the right to organize act (pro act) which would make it easier for unions to organize workers by, among other things, greatly increasing penalties on corporations that break the law in battling to keep out unions.solid republican opposition, along with a filibuster, blocked efforts by barack obama and bill clinton to enact pro-union legislation, and it will be similarly difficult for biden to enact the pro act unless he musters 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.because senate republicans so often vote in line with corporate america’s wishes, it might also be difficult for biden to get a $15 minimum wage or paid family and medical leave through the senate.william samuel, director of government affairs at afl-cio, the largest federation of unions in the us, acknowledges that passing the pro act – a huge goal of labor – won’t be easy. he recommends that biden, in addition to pushing to pass the pro act, pursue a parallel strategy: “he should use his bully pulpit to support the right of workers to organize and to shame employers who trample on those rights” – for example, by criticizing amazon for firing the worker who led a new york walkout over covid-19 safety.“there will be lots of obstacles in his [biden’s] way and we can hope and pray he can use his executive authority and the bully pulpit to advance the cause of workers,” samuel said.because the senate might be a formidable barrier to pro-union or pro-worker legislation, samuel says biden should use federal procurement policy to raise standards for workers. many worker advocates want biden to require federal contractors to pay their workers a minimum of $15 an hour and guarantee them two-weeks’ paid medical and family leave.biden and his running mate, kamala harris, opposed a california ballot initiative in which voters – swayed in part by a $200m campaign financed by uber and other app-based companies – approved a measure that categorizes uber and lyft drivers and doordash delivery workers as independent contractors rather than employees. by defining them as independent contractors, the ballot initiative, known as proposition 22, means these workers won’t receive state minimum wage or overtime protections, won’t receive paid sick days or unemployment compensation and won’t have their companies reimburse their expenses, like gasoline.uber has said it hopes to pass prop 22-like laws or ballot initiatives to other states. but pitts said: “how do we find a way to stop the spread of prop 22 around the country – that’s an important thing.”it’s going to be a slog to undo all the damage that’s been done the past four years by the trump majority on the boardwilma liebmanworker advocates hope biden’s labor department will issue guidance that goes far to trump prop 22 by saying that under federal minimum wage and overtime laws, uber and lyft drivers should be considered employees, not independent contractors, because they are not truly independent: uber and lyft have great control over the work the drivers do, and the drivers are not really independently in business for themselves.weil, who headed the labor department’s wage and hour administration, said prop 22’s definition of independent contractors contradicts the definition under the federal fair labor standards act, a 1938 law that creates nationwide minimum wage and overtime protections. “you just can’t decide, ‘i can treat them as independent contractors if that’s counter to what our fair labor standards act says,’” weil said.the trump administration recently awarded an $810m contract to uber and lyft to provide rides to public agencies. worker advocates say the general services administration should use its power to set contract conditions to insist that uber and lyft pay their drivers $15 an hour and treat them as employees.labor leaders say they hope biden’s nlrb will reverse many of the anti-union actions taken by trump’s nlrb – for instance, making it harder for workers at franchises like mcdonald’s

4667,"the last few months have been quite eventful for uranium investors, with shares of companies all across the sector appreciating in value substantially. there have been many reasons why this is the case and it feels different to just being strong seasonality. below are 15 ‘first time’ things to look out for in this sector to start the year with, with full credit going to john quakes (@quakes99 on twitter), a retired earth sciences researcher, professor, analyst, writer and one of the best public sources for news about the uranium sector. i share his view that 2021 will prove to be an incredible year for the uranium sector and subsequently for anyone invested in it. now, onto the aforementioned ‘first times’: first time entering a new year with uranium already in a record supply deficit, which is set to deepen further with 2 major mines permanently closing this year in australia and niger (\~7 million pounds, gone). at the same time, demand for nuclear energy has remained strong throughout the covid-19 pandemic and continues to grow in a global shift to decarbonize industry dependent on fossil fuels.first time that cameco, the world’s 2nd largest producer, has begun a new year with every one of its uranium mines in canada shut down. both of the world’s 2 largest uranium mines are under care and maintenance, resulting in zero lbs being produced in canada as we enter 2021. the us is also producing zero lbs while kazakhstan’s production is at a multi-year low that is likely to continue thru 2022 under the nation’s current flex-down program and pandemic related mining disruptions. all uranium mines in the ukraine have also been shut down due to the inability of the mine operator to pay the wages of 5000 mine workers.fist time that at least 3 of the world’s largest uranium producers are forced into buying uranium on the spot market. cameco is now the largest spot market buyer in the world. world’s largest producer kazatomprom is now also a spot buyer, as is french orano given that heir canadian mills are suspended and their cominak mine in africa is heading for closure in march. inventory held by the world’s largest uranium producers is at rock bottom levels for the first time ever and in need of replenishment this year.first time the us has taken steps to support its domestic uranium mining industry by establishing a strategic uranium reserve, a 10 year buying program (1.5 billion dollars total) whereby the us government will purchase, convert and potentially enrich us mined uranium to create an emergency supply for us reactors. goal is to ensure at least 2 us uranium mining companies remain active and viable during this time when the commodity price of u3o8 is half the cost of production.first time in several decades that there is strong bipartisan support in the us to rebuild the existing nuclear energy industry and manufacture a new generation of advanced reactors on a global scale, which is seen as a high priority in order to catch up with russia and china who have become the new world leaders in nuclear energy.first time that uranium equities have entered a bull market when there is an actual supply deficit. the last bull market saw the price of uranium skyrocket on mine floods and other events that created the ‘fear’ of a supply deficit on the horizon, at a time when the us-russia megatons to megawatts program was still continuing to supply 20m lbs per year to us nuclear utilities, a program that continued until 2021 as the world’s largest virtual uranium mine.first time that a new year begins with spot market supplies significantly depleted. supply accessible to carry traders has been severely reduced. kazatomprom no longer sells any lbs into the spot market and orano’s supply from canada and niger is at a record low level, pushing nuclear utilities to secure new long term contracts with producers rather than entering into shorter term contracts with carry traders. security of supply is a top priority of utilities (whose inventories are estimated to be around 2,5 years’ worth of supply, when the guideline is to never let it drop below 2-3 years given the long time it takes to enrich and deliver the fuel to the reactors).first time that us and european nuclear utilities have begun a new year with inventories drawn down below usual safety margins at the same time that mines supply is in a record deficit and global uranium production is at its lowest level in 12 years. the new 2020 iaea/nea uranium red book projects that secondary supplies will fall in the future as an overdue utility inventory restocking cycle begins, due to higher levels of contracting, conversion and enrichment that will reduce underfeeding as facilities see their utilization rates rise.first time in several years that there are no geopolitical overhangs holding back the uranium contracting plans of us and european nuclear utilities. there are no potential section 232 actions targeting uranium imports and no sanctions likely against uun participants (russia, china, uk, germany, france) in the jcpoa iran nuclear deal. russia and the us have successfully negotiated a 20-year extension to the russian suspension agreement that will see the us imports from russia decline over the coming 2 decades. the incoming us administration supports keeping nuclear power plants running and plans to immediately rejoin the paris climate accord, pushing for global net zero emissions by 2050, a process in which nuclear energy will play a major role.first time that nations around the world will be recovering from a global pandemic with massive infrastructure spending programs that include boosting nuclear capacity to achieve net zero carbon emissions goals. a new ‘nuclear renaissance’ is beginning to take shape on pandemic recovery spending to boost clean energy. the perception of nuclear energy is also changing to that of a safe, reliable, necessary baseload power source that fits with an emerging esg investing model. decarbonization has become a new buzz word in the global vocabulary. the ‘electrification of everything’ from cars, buses, trucks and trains to major industry is the new global target. sustainability of so-called renewables solar and wind is now being called into question after failures by germany and california to successfully transition to an economy powered by intermittent energy sources. higher electricity prices, no net carbon emissions reductions and rolling blackouts have demonstrated how ‘renewables’ are not able to fulfill their early promise. this might change with new battery technology and better implementation, but we are nowhere near that point yet.first time that uranium stocks are entering a new year on the heels of one of their best performance years since the last bull market. the u3o8 spot price is still one-half the global average cost of production that will incentivize new mines to be built this decade. this signals to investors that we are still at the opening pitch of the first inning of a long game yet to play out. a necessary doubling of the u3o8 commodity price is yet to come.first time that canada has begun a new year embarking on a small modular reactors build-out program with several provinces pledging to deploy smr’s to power remote communities, mines and industrial heat applications in the energy industry.first time that nuclear is being viewed as the ideal carbon free high-temperature power source to produce clear hydrogen fuel. us, russia, japan and others are looking to leverage their existing nuclear power capacity to produce hydrogen and build high-temperature smr’s to optimize the use of emissions free nuclear to produce zero emissions hydrogen.first time in decades that there is an emerging surge in acceptance of nuclear  of nuclear energy as necessary to achieve zero carbon emissions goals, with countries like the netherlands looking to add more capacity after conducting studies showing nuclear is safer and cheaper than variable renewable energy.first time i can recall one of the leading nuclear fuel consultants uxc reporting to their subscribers that uranium is in a 57m lbs mined supply deficit, that utility and supplier inventories are “declining at a rapid rate” just as global fuel demand growth is accelerating, a clear signal that a bull market is getting underway.tldr: with all the catalysts that are in place, i am of the firm believe that uranium related equities, namely the developers and explorers, will offer returns that will outperform any other broad investment asset class/sector in the market. this is a bold claim to make, but i can’t see any other opportunity that offers even close to the same risk vs reward the uranium sector offers. read my other posts on the subject to get an idea of what companies you might want to look at and to get an answer to any question you might have. good luck and here is to a great new year!",413,1,2021

5123,"hey guys i am a 23 year old making 75k annually before taxes.  i have been working full time for about a year and a half now though i also worked part time while attending school. i am living at home and plan to do so for at least the next 5 years (i come from a culture where this is fairly normal). i already have invested 25k in voo over the course of the past year and i have 50k cash that i have been compiling and sitting on from my part time jobs and full time job. i am keeping 10k cash in my emergency fund. so total net worth i guess would be 85k. i really regret not getting some of this 50k into the market during the march 2020 dip but i don't have much experience so at the time i was dca'ing the dip with very small amounts every day (2k-3k). should have been more ballsy and i've been kicking myself for this but didn't fully comprehend the opportunity at the time and hindsight is 20/20. anyways, i am only comfortable investing in etfs and after weeks of looking at countless of them i decided on this blend:voo: 33%  (i know some people suggest vti but i already had 25k in voo so i make up for it below by getting some small cap in there with vbk). i am not investing any of the 50k into voo just keeping the 25k in there.  25k/75k =33% vgt: 40% (very aggressive and tech heavy and a decent amount of overlap with voo but i really am passionate about this sector and am totally ok with the risk given my plan to hold long term. i am most excited about this fund and following these cutting edge companies to see how they innovate over the coming decades. i am aware it is missing some major companies like fb and amzn. i'm ok with this and pick them up in vt below. honestly not the biggest fan of fb but i won't get into that).vbk: 15% vt: 12% (i was hesitant to add vxus/an international fund at first and still kind of am but they say that at any point the tables could turn and international markets could start outperforming the us. i decided to dilute this discomfort that i have with international stock with more of what voo/vti is holding in addition to the international companies). i know there is some overlap but i'm hoping my logic above justifies it. plus most of the overlap happens with the top 10 companies held in voo, vt, vgt and some people only buy voo so in my mind the overlap isn't a big deal. please feel free to pick apart my logic or make suggestions/adjustments.  side question if you guys aren't tired of the already long post: the money i put in the stock market won't be touched for decades (ideally) but i do have to keep in mind that i want to buy a home by (at the latest) age 30. income should jump up to 90k before taxes by 26 given my career path. average home prices in my area should be 800k by then at current appreciation rates. 20% down= $160k. $160k/6 years= $26,700 set aside per year. i don't want to miss out on the power of compound interest with this money while saving up for a down payment but do i have any other choice besides putting it into a cd or money market account or bonds? would hate to put that money in the stock market and then a dip happens and i have to sell to get that down payment i need at a loss. any suggestions on this or does that money just have to be sacrificed to low to no return if i am planning to buy a home? thanks!",2,1,Advice Needed: Aggressive Investment Portfolio with Plans to Purchase a Home,Finance

5999,"hello all,  looking for some opinions on this more philosophical (and financial) problem i’m facing. a couple of months ago, i came across one of my all time favorite cars that wasn’t for sale, but looked badass and piqued my desire. i spoke with the owner who was in the limbo of “should i sell or not” and essentially shrewdly negotiated with him to get an insane deal on the car. i paid 22k for the car, and it’s legitimately worth around 33k (and appreciating).i liquidated some assets + has some cash to come up with the money and wrote the check. the car is freaking fantastic. i absolutely love driving it and it’s by far my favorite hobby. so here is my dilemma: should i keep the car and enjoy it, or sell it and generate 10kish profit and invest the 30k? i am working at a lean firm that is high growth and cash strapped, and right now i am being paid much at all (but enough to survive). the payoff, my anticipation, is in the next 1.5-3 years. until then, my income will be lower than average. my current net worth is about 60k + the car (33k). the majority of my capital is efficient and working, and invested in well performing assets (but only about 30% of it is liquid). my living situation is fine for me and am happy with quality of life. i have 0 debt and minimal fixed and variable expenses.pros of keeping:- i work laborious hours and my favorite escape is getting behind my car and driving, i usually spend most of my free time doing it. it brings me a ton of joy. - the car is cool, rare(ish) and an incredible networking tool (car looks a lot more expensive then what i paid) and i can use it to open more conversations/network. - these cars are notoriously reliable (with preventative maintenance) and it’s appreciating in value. i paid cash for it so the only real expense i have is opportunity cost. - you only live once and this feels like a quality of life thing.- it is liquid so in case of emergency i could generate cash quickly. pro selling:- i am considerably young to drive a car like this, and perhaps i should wait some time before i own a sports car (and when it is less than my net worth)- i have access to invest in assets that perform alpha much greater than market returns. 33k is still almost a 3rd of my net worth and could be used to invest and compound right now - there’s 10k + free profit sitting in the car that i haven’t realized - i wouldn’t be carless, my family has a spare, nice, reliable (albeit not fun) car that they said i can use.- the bet i’m taking too is based on my current position, i’ll be able to easier afford a similar car in a few years (albeit perhaps not the same great deal i got).i’ve been going back and forth on this, would love to hear some feedback from you guys.",3,1,Enjoy my favorite (appreciating) sports car or use it as compounding capital?,Finance

board overview4. financial analysis5. competitive landscape6. ipo details7. the bottom line## abcellera business modelabcellera provides drug developers with a platform to find antibody candidates for drug research. its ai-powered full-stack platform searches and analyzes real-world immune system databases to find leads that are subsequently used for clinical r&amp;d. unlike its competitors, abcellera operates along the entire value chain from sourcing to the delivery of antibody candidates; this solves the existing problem of either inadequate/outdated discovery approaches or using multiple fragmented solutions (costly and inefficient).abcellera’s revenue is split into three streams - these streams include:1. licensing / research fees (68% of revenue, 9 months ended september 30, 2020): payments for technology access and performing research2. milestone payments (32% of revenue): downstream payments for clinical/commercial milestones. note: only one program, ly-cov555 with eli lilly, to date has resulted in milestone payments3. royalties: royalties on net sales of any approved therapeutics. note: as of september 30, 2020, abcellera has yet to receive any royalties. royalties generally will range from low-single digit for non-covid targets to mid-teens to mid-twenties for covid targetsas of september 30, 2020, abcellera had 94 discovery programs either completed, in-progress, or under contract, with a few public key partnerships below. some of abcellera’s recent, public partnerships are as follows:*eli lilly (nyse: lly)* \- on march 12, 2020, abcellera and lilly announced to co-develop antibody therapies for the treatment of covid-19, the potential treatment ly-cov555 accelerated due to coronavirus treatment acceleration program. as part of the agreement, abcellera received an upfront payment of $25mn and is entitled to receive an aggregate of up to $29mn of milestone payments. as of september 30, 2020, abcellera has received $8mn related to ly-cov555 and is eligible to receive royalties on aggregate sales (including lilly’s $375mn and $312.5mn contracts with the us government and us army contracting command respectively).*invetx* \- on february 23, 2020, abcellera originally entered a multi-year, multi-target partnership agreement with invetx. based on the successful delivery of research programs under the original agreement, the scope of the collaboration has been expanded to include multiple new targets over several years on november 19, 2020.*kodiak sciences (nasdaq: kod) -* after a successful collaboration in 2016, abcellera and kodiak sciences announced a new partnership on october 29. 2020 to generate therapeutic antibody candidates in ophthalmology.*igm biosciences (nasdaq: igms) -* abcellera and igm biosciences announced on september 24, 2020, that they have entered into a multi-year, multi-target strategic research collaboration and license agreement to facilitate the discovery and development of novel igm antibodies.abcellera’s business strategy (per prospectus) is focused on (i) using the drug discovery platform to unlock new opportunities for therapeutic antibody development; and (ii) partners access the platform to eliminate the extended delays and costs associated with setting up drug discovery capabilities.## recent developments / company timeline1. in march 2020, abcellera entered into a discovery partnership with eli lilly and company, to perform discovery research for a number of targets for lilly that will result in antibodies for lilly to develop and potentially commercialize.2. in april 2020, abcellera entered into a multi-year agreement with the canadian government’s strategic innovation fund, and cad $175.6mn ($125.6mn) was committed by the government of canada, of which &gt;$110mn remains and is intended to be used to build a gmp facility.3. in june 2020, ly-cov555 moved to first in-inhuman testing and progressed to phase 3 clinical trials.4. in november 2020, ly-cov555 was granted emergency-use authorization by the fda and health canada. for the nine months ended september 30, 2020, abcellera received an aggregate of $8.0mn upon the satisfaction of clinical milestones by lilly.5. in november 2020, abcellera acquired trianni for $90.0mn. trianni develops transgenic mice that provide a source of fully-human antibodies for therapeutic antibody candidates. trianni mouse technology will allow abcellera to generate more high-quality antibodies against difficult targets and improve the speed of the discovery programs. in addition to strategic value, trianni also generates revenues through mouse sales, platform licensing fees and associated downstream milestone payments.📷*company timeline: abcellera has demonstrated consistent growth and has generated positive operating cash flow cumulatively since its inception in 2012.*## management team &amp; bod overviewabcellera’s management team is highly experienced with significant experience in related industries. abcellera has also continued to bolster its board of directors with high-profile names including peter thiel (palantir, paypal, facebook) and john montalbano (cppib) ahead of its ipo.with its recent additions, we view abcellera’s management team and board as a strength.📷shareholders are detailed below:📷## financial analysisin part ii of this analysis, we will take a deeper dive into the valuation, pro forma financials, capital structure, and go-forward expectations for the business. the below provides a brief overview of the financials. we view the company to be financially healthy, given the low capitalization and limited contractual obligations, supported by continued licensing/research revenue and royalties from ly-cov555 and other contracts.**revenue** has grown at a 109% cagr since 2014, primarily driven by increased research fees (driven by the number and quality of programs under contract) and milestone fees (abcellera received its first milestone fee in 2020 from lilly of $8mn). september 2020 ytd revenue was \~$25mn (\~$30mn pro forma for trianni acquisition).**key revenue drivers** in the near term will include milestone payments on existing contracts and royalty payments from lilly for ly-cov555. the company is eligible for royalties in low- to mid-teens for aggregate sales below $125mn and mid-teens to mid-twenties on aggregate sales above $125mn. assuming a 20% royalty on existing us contracts (\~$690mn), this would drive an incremental $137mn of revenue (excluding an additional $21mn available through milestone payments).**liquidity** will be bolstered by the equity raise, with the use of proceeds used to continue making investments in r&amp;d, building its business development team and other general corporate purposes. abcellera has more than $8mn of total future contractual obligations and commitments (as of september 30, 2020), which can be financed through cash on hand or other debt (abcellera has demonstrated access to bank and private placement debt).**capital structure** will look significantly different post-ipo; pro forma for the conversion of \~$80mn of convertible preferred shares and $90mn of convertible notes, abcellera will have limited leverage on the balance sheet.## competitive environmentabcellera’s current market position as a full-stack service provider provides meaningful barriers to entry, with its primary competitors providing services at some point along its value chain. the integrated nature of abcellera’s services (provides integrated services from start to end), in addition to the nature of its ai-platform (interconnection and scale enable ai to continuously become more efficient) is a competitive advantage.that being said, the life sciences and biotech platform technology market is highly competitive; technical competitors at different stages of abcellera’s platform in the following fields are detailed below:single-cell screening: berkeley lights inc. (nasdaq: bli), hifibio inc., ligand pharmaceuticals inc. (nasdaq: lgnd), and sphere fluidics ltd.antibody repseq: 10x genomics inc. (nasdaq: txg), adaptive biotechnologies corp. (nasdaq: adpt), atreca inc (nasdaq: bcel). and distributed bio inc.bispecific antibody engineering: abbvie inc. (nyse:[abbv](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/abbv)), genmab a/s, merus n.v. and zymeworks inc. (nyse:[zyme](https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/zyme))discovery using genetically engineered rodents: ablexis llc, crescendo biologics ltd., harbour antibodies bv, kymab ltd., ligand pharmaceuticals inc (nasdaq: lgnd). and renbio inc.in addition, abcellera competes with a variety of fee-for-service contract research organizations, in most cases using legacy technologies that would compete with one or more steps in abcellera’s technology stack. organizations may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems rather than rely on abcellera’s platform.## ipo detailsthe ipo will be jointly underwritten by credit suisse (left lead), stifel, berenberg, svb (healthcare specialist) and bmo capital markets. while the ipo has yet to be priced, we expect the ipo to price wide of the latest $12.46 funding round precedents, driven by continued positive news (fda and health canada approval for bamlanivimab, trianni acquisition, new contracts, and more). we note the following pricing precedents:* march 2020: series a2 preferred shares issued at $12.46/sh* april 2020: existing shareholder purchased \~$600k of shares at $11.21/sh* june 2020: existing shareholder purchased \~$3mn of shares at $11.21/sh* october 2020: granted options to employees, consultants and directors to purchase \~3.6mn shares at a weighted average of $10.51assuming a $25/share ipo price (refinements to valuation to come), we expect the fully-diluted share count to be \~39.8mn (\~15.4mn shares outstanding as of september 30 plus \~$8.0mn shares issued as part of ipo plus \~8.1mn of convertible preferreds plus \~4.2mn of convertible notes plus \~4.0mn of options in the money), putting the pro forma market capitalization at \~$1.0bn.## the bottom lineour investment thesis: we think that abcellera is well-positioned to grow as a leader in an attractive, lucrative, and fragmented industry, supported by a strong management team and board. as the company continues to find success, abcellera will transition from its position today as a company heavily dependent on near-term binary outcomes (reliance on a few partnerships with milestone payments for revenue) to a more stable (royalty cash flows) company with significant upside for growth.**the positives:*** world-class management &amp; shareholder support     * *experienced executive team with deep experience (stemcell, precision nanosystems)*   * *strong and supportive long-term minority shareholders and experience board** leading industry platform with barriers to entry     * *full-stack solution is a unique value proposition vs. its competitors.*   * *data generated through discovery partnerships provide the basis for training ai modules that yield new insights into antibody responses;

strategies. # before making any decision, financial advisors such as [www.wealthface.com](https://www.wealthface.com) recommend you to consider these areas of importance:**1.   create your financial roadmap -** before making any investment portfolio decision, figure out what your investment goals are. simultaneously, also figure out what is the level of risk that you are ready to intake. be mentally prepared that there is no guarantee of you making money. there are chances that you may suffer a loss. therefore, build an intelligent plan which will help you to gain financial security over the years and enjoy its benefits. **2.   evaluate your comfort zone** *-* there are several investment options available to individuals with varying degrees of risks. with higher risks comes higher rewards. therefore, decide upon your horizon of investment to make more meaningful and wise investment portfolio decisions. for a longer tenure, go with asset categories like stocks or bonds, rather than restricting your investments to cash instruments. these may be appropriate for short-term financial goals.**3.   create a diversified investment portfolio -** all different asset categories moves differently with constant changes in the market conditions. an investment portfolio should be diverse enough to give sustained returns and also act as a barrier to protect against significant losses. by investing in more than one asset category, you'll reduce the risk of losing money. if one asset category fails, you'll still have a significant position to counteract your losses with other asset categories. **4.   create and maintain an emergency fund** *-* smart investors always keep a corpus of their fund to cover up emergencies, like sudden unemployment. wise investments are the one that is made using a particular proportion of the total savings of an individual.**5. understand the correct time to leave an asset -** most of the investors fail to understand when exactly should they catch hold and leave a particular asset on their investment portfolio. it is always wise for investors to stay abreast with the changing market conditions so that they can make better decisions and smoother profits.**6.   get aware of market statistics** *-* it is always advisable for investors to make themselves aware of all the market news surrounding their particular investment. they need to understand the past trends and future forecasts of the asset. not only this, but they must also understand the impact of various factors that affect the positioning of the asset in the market. a careful and detailed analysis of such sort will be the change in fortunes of the investor.**7.   take advantage of “free money” from the employer** *- in most cases*, there are different employer-sponsored schemes mentioned in the employment ctc. instead of saving it, you can make this money work for you to generate some extra income. **8.   rebalancing your portfolio occasionally** *-* investors need to ensure that they have a proper asset allocation mix. for this, with the changing market conditions, it becomes very crucial for them to rebalance their investment portfolio to maintain a comfortable level of risk and return. the common funds should remain the same, i.e., buy low, sell high. such a rebalancing can be made either on a calendar basis or on an asset basis. rebalancing tends to work best when done on a relatively infrequent basis.**9.   avoid fraudulent circumstances -** with the changing dynamics of the industry, there are some scams taking place in this particular market. there are companies which use highly publicized news items to lure potential investors and make their “opportunity” sound more legitimate. therefore, it is wise to go for an unbiased source of information to track your investment asset.**10. avoid lottery effect -** pick investments only after a careful analysis of the same. even the best of portfolios have failed because of poor investment decisions. keep positive expectations in the long run. try to avoid constant speculations because: (a) the promised gains won't materialize, or(b) the investor is faced with a liquidity crisis that requires selling the holdings prematurely and at a loss.**11.  measure your return on investment (roi) -** to understand the performance of your portfolio, investors need to understand what each dollar of their investment is likely to yield. \[roi = (gains - cost) / cost\] a higher roi will pose a higher risk to your portfolio, and therefore, controlling risk is one of the primary functions of sound portfolio management.# the bottom linethroughout the entire investment portfolio construction process, it is vital to ensure that your holdings within a given asset

security over the years and enjoy its benefits. **2.   evaluate your comfort zone** *-* there are several investment options available to individuals with varying degrees of risks. with higher risks comes higher rewards. therefore, decide upon your horizon of investment to make more meaningful and wise investment portfolio decisions. for a longer tenure, go with asset categories like stocks or bonds, rather than restricting your investments to cash instruments. these may be appropriate for short-term financial goals.**3.   create a diversified investment portfolio -** all different asset categories moves differently with constant changes in the market conditions. an investment portfolio should be diverse enough to give sustained returns and also act as a barrier to protect against significant losses. by investing in more than one asset category, you'll reduce the risk of losing money. if one asset category fails, you'll still have a significant position to counteract your losses with other asset categories. **4.   create and maintain an emergency fund** *-* smart investors always keep a corpus of their fund to cover up emergencies, like sudden unemployment. wise investments are the one that is made using a particular proportion of the total savings of an individual.**5. understand the correct time to leave an asset -** most of the investors fail to understand when exactly should they catch hold and leave a particular asset on their investment portfolio. it is always wise for investors to stay abreast with the changing market conditions so that they can make better decisions and smoother profits.**6.   get aware of market statistics** *-* it is always advisable for investors to make themselves aware of all the market news surrounding their particular investment. they need to understand the past trends and future forecasts of the asset. not only this, but they must also understand the impact of various factors that affect the positioning of the asset in the market. a careful and detailed analysis of such sort will be the change in fortunes of the investor.**7.   take advantage of “free money” from the employer** *- in most cases*, there are different employer-sponsored schemes mentioned in the employment ctc. instead of saving it, you can make this money work for you to generate some extra income. **8.   rebalancing your portfolio occasionally** *-* investors need to ensure that they have a proper asset allocation mix. for this, with the changing market conditions, it becomes very crucial for them to rebalance their investment portfolio to maintain a comfortable level of risk and return. the common funds should remain the same, i.e., buy low, sell high. such a rebalancing can be made either on a calendar basis or on an asset basis. rebalancing tends to work best when done on a relatively infrequent basis.**9.   avoid fraudulent circumstances -** with the changing dynamics of the industry, there are some scams taking place in this particular market. there are companies which use highly publicized news items to lure potential investors and make their “opportunity” sound more legitimate. therefore, it is wise to go for an unbiased source of information to track your investment asset.**10. avoid lottery effect -** pick investments only after a careful analysis of the same. even the best of portfolios have failed because of poor investment decisions. keep positive expectations in the long run. try to avoid constant speculations because: (a) the promised gains won't materialize, or(b) the investor is faced with a liquidity crisis that requires selling the holdings prematurely and at a loss.**11.  measure your return on investment (roi) -** to understand the performance of your portfolio, investors need to understand what each dollar of their investment is likely to yield. \[roi = (gains - cost) / cost\] a higher roi will pose a higher risk to your portfolio, and therefore, controlling risk is one of the primary functions of sound portfolio management.# the bottom linethroughout the entire investment portfolio construction process, it is vital to ensure that your holdings within a given asset class are divided across an array of subclasses and industry sectors. by thoroughly articulating your monetary goals and being an active participant in your financial planning process, you will be

180,"there have been many recent threads explaining why everyone needs an emergency fund and why it should never be intermingled with other investments. i disagree with that, especially for fire-seekers with portfolios many times larger than annual expenses. instead, all extra cash can be invested according to your typical asset allocation. assuming a large enough portfolio, this strategy can mitigate the downside risk by selling investments to cover expenses in case of emergency. but the real differentiator is that it also maximizes the upside. by having more money invested, you will end up with a greater net worth over time.of course, this strategy is only viable if you have a portfolio that can take a hit and still cover your expenses in an emergency. if you haven’t yet reached that point, saving in a more traditional emergency fund is beneficial. but if you’ve started to accumulate some wealth, you’re better off without an emergency fund.**what is an emergency fund?**the general purpose of an emergency fund or a “rainy day fund” is to ensure you can cover expenses in an unexpected financial emergency, such as job loss or large medical bills. the exact definition of an emergency fund is a bit murky, but there are two generally agreed-upon traits:- held in cash or highly liquid vehicle such as a checking account, saving account, or money market fund- able to cover 6-12 months of expensesholding a traditional emergency fund like this is one way to mitigate financial downside, but it is not optimal. to determine what is optimal, we need to assess the ultimate goal of an emergency fund. breaking it down, the goals are:1. have enough cash in hand to cover immediate expenses2. be able to withstand a period of up to a year with no incomethe first goal should be met through the standard operating cash that you have available, without requiring an emergency fund. for example, i keep two months of expenses in my checking account for rent, food, etc. the second goal can then be accomplished with financial vehicles that can take a few days to get cash in hand. this opens many possible solutions, including cash under a mattress, gold buried in your backyard, money in a saving account, or a sizable investment portfolio.since all of these could meet the goals of an emergency fund, how can we choose which is optimal? we need another goal.**what an emergency fund should be – mitigate risk and maximize net worth**the two previously mentioned goals of an emergency fund relate to reducing downside risk. but what about the upside? we shouldn’t mitigate risk without thinking about how it can impact our ability to accumulate more wealth. so, let’s add a third goal:1. have enough cash in hand to cover immediate expenses2. be able to withstand a period of up to a year with no income3. after the above two goals are met, maximize net worth over timeif your portfolio is large enough to withstand a significant drop and still cover a year’s expenses, these three goals are best met without a traditional emergency fund. the first goal is met by your operating cash, the second by selling investments, and the third by adding as much money to your investment portfolio as possible.this is intuitive: having more money invested and less in cash will come out ahead over time. but some argue that being forced to sell stocks at a low price after a market downturn will offset the higher average returns from the additional investment. to analyze that counterpoint, let’s look at history.**history shows that no emergency fund performs better**we’ll analyze two investors over the period from 2000 through 2019, which includes two major market downturns. both investors started with annual income of $65,000 and expenses of $40,000 that increased with inflation each year. both kept sufficient operating expenses in a checking account to meet liquid cash need. one investor (ef) saved an additional year of expenses in an emergency fund, with returns that equal inflation. the other (no-ef) invested in a 100% equity portfolio of the vanguard total stock market fund (vtsmx or vti).the two investors are compared across two scenarios: the worst-case scenario and the best-case scenario. in the worst-case scenario, both investors lost their jobs and had zero income in both 2003 and 2009. the ef investor covered expenses from his emergency fund, and the no-ef investor sold stocks to cover expenses. in the best-case scenario, both investors maintained their jobs throughout the 20-year period. here is how they fared:| year end | no-ef net worth (worst case) | ef net worth (worst case) | no-ef net worth (best case) | ef net worth (best case) ||--------|:-------|-------:|:------:|:------:|| 1999 | $200,000 | $200,000 | $200,000 | $200,000 || 2004 | $247,000 | $225,000 | $342,000 | $350,000 || 2009 | $312,000 | $257,000 | $510,000 | $523,000 || 2014 | $884,000 | $735,000 | $1,292,000 | $1,268,000 || 2019 | $1,740,000 | $1,455,000 | $2,430,000 | $2,356,000 |([full table and graphs here](http://financialvictory.co/you-dont-need-an-emergency-fund/))in both scenarios, the no-ef investor comes out ahead. surprisingly, the difference between the two investors is more pronounced in the worst-case scenario when they lose their jobs. in this case **the no-ef investor ends up with a net worth 20% ($285,000) higher.**while it is true the no-ef investor is forced to sell stocks low, he also buys back in low, shortly after the crash. the ef investor, on the other hand, misses out on this buying opportunity because he spends the next year-and-a-half building back his emergency fund before buying more stock. this causes the ef investor to miss the significant market gains after the crashes.unsurprisingly, the no-ef investor also wins in the best-case scenario, though the net worth difference is less pronounced at only 3%.**portfolio size needed to forgo an emergency fund**based on this analysis, it is clear that an investor with a large enough portfolio should forgo an emergency fund. the question, then, becomes: how large of a portfolio is “large enough”?the portfolio needs to be able to cover a year’s expenses even after a sharp drop. the largest one-year decline of the s&amp;p 500 was 43.3% in 1931. to be extra conservative, let’s assume that a market drop of 75% is possible. to withstand that drop, your available portfolio would need to be 4 times your annual expenses. for example, a portfolio of $200,000 could fall 75% and still cover $50,000 in expenses if sold. if the market drops more than 75%, you likely have bigger societal problems that wouldn’t be solved by any emergency fund.this amount must be available for you to withdraw without penalty. this includes regular taxable investments and roth ira and 401k contributions (after 5 years), but it does not include traditional 401k contributions.&amp;nbsp;**holy wall of text! tldr?**if you have built a sizable portfolio, you don’t need a separate stash of cash as your emergency fund. instead, you can invest all funds according to your asset allocation and sell in case of emergency. this will effectively mitigate your financial downside while also maximizing your net worth over time, allowing you to go fuck yourself faster.&amp;nbsp;a better-formatted post with detailed calculations and excel file is available [here](http://financialvictory.co/you-dont-need-an-emergency-fund/)",24,2,You don't need an emergency fund if you have a large portfolio,Finance

242,"the 10 year treasury which is the basis for swr research is currently sitting at a record low of 0.74%. not just below average, but all time record low. i am curious to hear some discussion of what this might mean for swr research and fire strategies.with bond yields at record lows, fire investors are faced with a choice between locking up a large portion of their portfolio in risk free assets with an expected *nominal* return of under 1%, or take their chances with a more aggressive stock allocation. (you might look at 10-15 year performance of bond funds and note that they have returned more than their yield, but that is only due to the long term trend of lower interest rates, culminating in what we are seeing today). the goodrecord low interest rates is an indication of low underlying inflation. institutions are only willing to loan money so cheap if they have confidence that the principal will have the same value with the interest paid back. arguably, this new world of low yields is only possible with the removal of one of the principal threats to retirement success. this also means things like cheaper mortgages and other debt.the bad however, this means there is no historical precedent for such low income (actually negative real return) coming from the bond side of the portfolio. perhaps more importantly, the larger macroeconomic context is unprecedented, so we just don't know what effects this trend could have. for example, the fed may have less room to stimulate the economy in the event of a recession. a market crash when interest rates are already effectively zero could potentially be larger in scale and longer in duration than previous events we have seen (on the other hand, it is possible that the fed is getting ahead of the potential recession, propping up the economy to pre-empt a major crash. this seems to be what the fed is thinking with its emergency rate cut this week). while swr research is based on 100's of years of backtesting data, the current situation is unprecedented. i submit that we simply cannot say for sure that the swr research will hold up. possible strategies1. shift to higher yielding corporate bonds. however, corporate bonds are riskier and more correlated with the market than treasuries, therefore expected to produce lower risk-adjusted returns. muni bonds may have the same issue. 2. increase your stock allocation. however, you will be more vulnerable to sequence of returns risk, especially in the scenario above where the fed has no ability to correct a major market event. 3. shift to tips. at least tips will be guaranteed to match inflation (although i have seen some reports of tips starting to sell with negative real rates). however, tips are somewhat less un-correlated with the market than traditional treasuries and don't do as well in backtesting. 4. explore annuities. annuities can provide guaranteed income. however, they are subject to inflation risk, can be costly, and you lose the ability to pass the principal on to your heirs. basically, i don't see a good option that does not involve saving more. i am curious to hear thoughts on how fire folks are strategizing and coping with this inherent uncertainty.",81,1,Does SWR Apply with Record Low Interest Rates?,Finance

401,"i read the rules and i thin i'm allowed to make a post like this, so please let me know if i need to change anything... i am also not sure what flair to add for this post.i graduated college in 2019 and now i have my first real ""adult"" job. i grew up poor and with this job i make more in a year than my mom made in 4 years. growing up, we didn't have much, and we never got new things. i always had to get creative and make the things i wanted instead of buying them, and i very rarely had nice things or got things that i wanted. now that i have my own income, i am trying to budget appropriately but it has been difficult for me to regulate myself. i go back-and-forth between mindsets of ""i don't have to buy things, i never did before"" and ""i can afford it, so i should let myself have nice things/ buy things when i want them"". i think i have made a reasonable budget, actually i think i have given myself a pretty high budget because the grocery store by my apartment is expensive and i've given myself a lot of leeway in terms of ""personal spending"" every month. but i still go over the budget, mainly because of takeout or because i just want to buy things. due to growing up poor, i still don't have a lot of things for myself, and i have to buy them- like recently i bought a heating pad and a coat rack. and with that purchase i'm still going back-and-forth between ""i could've gone without those things"" and ""i should get the things that i need to make me feel comfortable.""but it's more than that, it's like sometimes i just get this itch to buy things, and it doesn't have to be new things-- it can be satisfied by buying a coffee or something from thrift stores, or by just getting something i've wanted for a while. i think this comes from being a teenager and never having money, and now i want to spend what i have while i have it. it's not a super urgent problem, because i've built up a nice emergency fund, but i want to spend less in general because the career path i am likely going to follow is not going to make me this much money, so i want to take this opportunity to save as much as i can while i have this job. i don't really understand investing and i don't have a savings account, i just have a second checking account that i use as savings (this is because when i had my first few jobs, i had too many financial emergencies to have my small amount of money locked behind a savings account, but now that i have enough income coming in each month to cover my expenses, then maybe putting all the extra money into a savings account would help me).do you all have any advice for overcoming this mindset and for sticking to my budget?",21,1,Advice for sticking to a budget?,Finance

(she claims repairs, but i'm not sure i trust her) she caught up early this month. which cost me most of the score progress i've made in the past year. now that i have a bit more stability i am trying to decide on my next steps. my instinct is to continue paying down the visa as fast as i can to get rid of the interest charges. then work on the amex, since my pay is not garnishable.the deal with the truck has made things more complicated, because i don't like her having the ability to influence my finances. there are 5 payments left. she's dying, at least, she says she is. (metastatic colon cancer) if she does, the truck reverts to me. before i knew she was sick i had told her that i wouldn't sign the truck over to her unless she paid the repair related debts. her response was that she was dying, so i could sell it to cover everything she owes me. but now that i can't even trust her to make the payments...  if another stimulus comes through there is a temptation just to finish paying it and write her off completely. at least then i wouldn't have to worry about scrambling to make payments if she dies before paying it off.

employment: $70k/year and monthly take-home is $3,800 as an entry level position. i'm currently not putting anything into the company retirement option (minimal employer match &amp; no match until after the first year, which just became available for me).expenses: credit card payments over the last year average to $1, 013/mo. debit card is probably another $500. these include misc. like food, gas, online classes, gifts, some travel etc. haven't exactly been frugal...on top of this, my living costs (car payments + rent) = $1,100/mo. i live with my so, our finances are separate but we're sharing costs. their name's on both the car &amp; apartment leases. student loans:$62.5k, in 4 separate groups (by year), interest rates are smallest on largest loans ranging from 5.3% on $20k to 6% on 10k. federal unsubsidized, all of which were supposed to go into repayment last august but are all in covid forbearance. i opted for extended repayment for flexibility but with intention to pay much more, the combined estimated monthly would have been around $400/mo minimum. i dislike the idea of paying this for years on-end and consider throwing everything i've set aside into halving this debt. however i wouldn't mind if the alternative means giving me a leg up on purchasing property/other long-term investment.savings:the reason i'm here asking for advice. i have low-risk stocks my relative setup when i was born for my college tuition, after which i still have about $15k in the account. i honestly don't fully understand them and don't want to really mess with it unless i'm emptying it all to put down on a house or similar. advice welcome. on top of that i have another $25k in savings set aside over this last year that was supposed to go towards student loans. don't have a designated emergency fund or retirement &amp; up until covid happened, i was plodding along with assumption that paying student loans was the best roi.other considerations:financial experience: limited, in case it's not apparent.  i do have good credit (fico score = 780) but not much credit history; parents were cosigners on my college apartments, they helped with undergrad tuition (loan in my name). i've never owned a car or had considerable loans/purchases other than tuition. my so owns the car. i've never missed a credit card payment, expenses are minimal. graduated with masters degree and i've retained employment through the pandemic so that's a big plus in my book. i imagine it'd be hard to get approved for a mortgage on my own, however see below on relationship.more about the job: i have a year at my company  but i'm looking to transition into my preferred industry that realistically i'd expect a pay cut to around $45 - $50k/year for entry level. the transition would be to pursue my passion and field of study. some of the current experience translates but pay cut would be inevitable (this would be worth it to me just for the job fulfilment alone).  with covid the sector is struggling a bit more than my current industry.  i have my masters degree but again no experience in the sector; i have yet to land an interview so may be some time before it materializes.relationship: serious committed relationship of several years; this is the person i want to spend my life with! have yet to combine our finances and could also use advice here. they make considerably more than me ($110k/year) so the combined income would of course change the financial landscape i've detailed above significantly. don't know their full financial situation but i believe they do have a few grand in credit card debt and they have the car ($400/mo for 5 years), no other major loans. we're late 20's/early 30's so naturally talking about big life choices on the horizon like marriage, moving &amp; buying a house, year off for travel etc. feeling a bit stagnant in our current living situation and looking to mix it up. obviously this pandemic changes things but feels like we're both doing solid compared to most. my industry is typically conservative (traditional office, work up the ranks &amp; earn license, limited time off, no remote work) which limits where/if we could move. in contrast my partner's is unconventional (tech) that allows for flexibility to work anywhere.so there you have it! any advice (&amp; criticism) welcome, just happy to have someone else's perspective. if you've read this far, thank you! i'm not very financially savvy, don't understand investing, real estate (or even taxes) so i'm a bit nervous to make a bold decision but also don't want to just sit around with my hands tied. mostly i just recognize that i have this opportunity of liquid assets and am much more fortunate than many during these times. i think about single parents or business owners who really are at the end of their rope; just feels like i should be doing something with my situation that others may never get.",1,1,"I've built up $40k in savings: investment property, open Roth IRA, or student loans?

1836,"hi,i'm a project engineer (24 f) in virginia making 60k with a boyfriend (23) also an engineer and making 65k. my grandfather can no longer care for his home and has considered having me take responsibility for it. my family and the house is in a prime suburb of chicago and has about 150k mortgage left on it. before this opportunity came along, my bf and i made plans to return home and find work in the chicago area because family is important to us. also, virginia is just very different from the diverse area we are proud to have come from. i personally have a little less than 30k in student loans that i've been paying off slowly. required payments on these loans will start for me in march 2021. no car debt and no credit card debt. also, i'm ashamed to say i don't even have a budget and that is one of the things i need to prioritize for 2021 (house or no house). i split bills with my bf and save the rest. i don't spend my money on much of anything and just like to watch my savings account get bigger. i currently have a little over 10k in the bank that i stash up as emergency funds. my bf wants me to invest that money in the stock market (eh...) and my mom wants me to use that to pay student loans. i'm thinking i can possibly use that for this house and student loans. my credit score is 705 and i saw that it dipped a little bit from me paying off my car and some student loans in early 2020. also, i'm pretty confident i can find work back home in chicago fast as i've interned for many local general contractors in the area and have high recommendations and networks.in terms of my boyfriend, even though we are committed to each other and i can see him in my future, this financial responsibility would be on me until he decides to put a ring on it. he knows about the house opportunity and wants to financially help me with it but i rejected his offers. this house would also help him be closer to his family as both of our families are in the chicago suburbs. we are both excited about this house and can see ourselves building a family in it. it really is in the perfect location and in a community we love. my parents are about 10 min away from it and boyfriend's parents are 30 min away. way better than the 16-hour drive from our virginia apartment!what is keeping up my boyfriend from putting a ring on it you may ask? i honestly think he will ask in the next few years given that we will be in chicago. we've been dating for 3yrs with this last year living together away in virginia. also, i know he feels 23 years is still very young to be making commitments like this... heck, i think 24 years is very young. i'm excited about a proposal but i want him to take his time. i'll start worrying about it when we are 5 years in and i still have no ring.the houses next to my grandfather's house are worth 350k+. unfortunately, my grandfather never took care of the house and he has a personal budget of 12k to spend on repairs for it. nothing is wrong with the structure and the repairs are purely cosmetic (\~from inspector). so with his 12k and my possible contribution of 10k, i believe we can get the house in good shape. also with me working in construction for a year, i'm thinking i can put what i've been learning in virginia to the test :) my parent's also offered me to live with them for the time repairs are made on the house... or if i decide to rent it out while i live with my parents for a few more years.overall, i want to know if taking responsibility for my grandfather's house is feasible, and a smart financial decision for me. this house is very sentimental to my family and i do have a past emotional connection with it. it's tough to walk through this time-capsule of a house and see how neglected it's been and it brings a lot of emotions for my father and myself. i want to rebuild what was neglected and help my family. thank you for reading. this has been on my mind for months!",75,1,Is buying my grandfather's house something I should consider?,Finance

1889,"so with the passing of the new covid relief bill, i wanted to get people's thoughts on whether there's an argument to initiate a 401k/403b withdrawal to get in on the housing ladder more quickly.  my gut feeling is that it would make sense if the right place came along, but it would rely on a covid discount and current trends continuing over the medium term (significant growth in prices yoy, low inventory) which is always a gamble. we live in a high cost of living area where 2 and 3 bedroom condos go for 500k - 1m in the towns we want to live in, and we don't have access to a lot of cash to pay for a down payment. we wouldn't be able to afford 20% for 5+ years and would have to do pmi or some equivalent; it's extremely unlikely for us to get any help from family or an inheritance. there are more affordable towns, but we want a place with decent public transit (or at least transit accessibility to boston), walkable shops, and a good school system. otherwise, we'd just continue to rent until those preferences change. i wouldn't normally want to do something like this, understanding the power of compound interest and average market returns and everything, but it seems to be a way to accelerate plans that would take years to do otherwise. when i look at affordability calculators it's hard to find things bigger than a 2 bedroom that would fit in our budget after factoring in mortgage insurance and the higher principal.  and if we did loans from our retirement accounts, i'd feel like paying on a set schedule with after-tax dollars (and with interest, even if it goes to us) would be undesirable in its own way. details:* 31\[m\] and 31\[f\]* 150k of 180k retirement available to withdraw between our accounts* \~50k in cash assets (this includes emergency funds)* \~32k in student loans, mostly my private ones at 4%* 200k/year in combined salary* good retirement benefits, i get 10% matched for 5% contribution in a 403b, partner has something like 4% matching and a workplace pension",16,1,No-Penalty 401k Withdrawal for Down Payment?,Finance

2009,"in discussing personal finance and budgeting with my father this weekend, i walked through the flowchart, and we ended up pretty far down the list of items.  however, parts of the discussion made me realize a few gaps in the process flow that i think could be improved upon.  i am, unfortunately, not skilled enough to update the flowchart myself, so my thought was to create a discussion within the community to hopefully lead to these changes being made.**retirees**once we got past the emergency fund portion, there is an implicit assumption that you are not retired, with no explicit yes/no split.  this is likely as few people visiting this site are themselves retired, collecting social security, but without enough retirement assets to draw down.  however, things aren’t the same for retirees, and they still spend too.  as i am not retired, i’m not an expert, but i do have some suggestions:- add a split for “are you already retired?” before discussion of retirement accounts- for the retirement branch: “if you earned income while collecting social security, consider whether funding an ira from your earned income could reduce tax liabilities if you are under-saved”- “if you are withdrawing money from multiple types of retirement accounts, evaluate the tax implications of whether to sequence or make proportional your withdrawals.”**capital investments**one other area missing from the flowchart came up when my father indicated that they had some repairs needed to their residence that i would consider “health and safety” related.  the flowchart does not anticipate you living in a situation where you put off key repairs to save money.  i think this should be called out as a preventative maintenance box to hopefully avoid creating additional emergencies that would steal from the emergency fund.either before or after the “build a small emergency fund” item (i’m not sure which makes more sense) it would be good to put in a section like: “if applicable, make needed repairs to home, utilities, and transportation to prevent failures and correct issues (e.g. hot water, fireplace cleaning, stove repair, vehicle maintenance, etc)”",6,1,Request to modify the flowchart,Finance

2909,"  i’m coming here because i need some advice about what to do next. i have been good about locking down my budget and saving, but my life circumstances have changed pretty drastically in the last year. i’ve been single for the last 7 years, but that has now changed and we are preparing for marriage by december. my anticipated gross income for this year is likely to be \~40k, 28k of that comes from my $13.80/hr wage (yearly raise coming in march, probably substantial due to knocking my metrics out of the park) and the rest comes in steady incentives that i am confident i will receive based on past performance. before anyone starts telling me to not budget based on my incentives, chill, because i don’t.expenses:rent (includes utilities and internet) – $550/month (split with roommates, gf and i don’t, can’t, and won’t cohabitate)phone -

$50/monthyou are likely wondering what other saving i have done or am doing. i have a $5000 emergency fund that i keep in a cd for easy access. i figure by the time i actually have an emergency i won’t mind taking a small interest penalty. my hsa currently has about $4000 in it. i also keep $1000 in cash in a safe at home and i have a miscellaneous savings account for random unaccounted for expenses that i currently have $1000 in. i also keep a well-stocked pantry and have about 5-6 months of food and 3 weeks of jugged drinking water on hand at all times, and i keep a similar timeframe’s worth of non-perishable necessities like toiletries and soap. i am thinking of opening a side investment account besides my retirement account, but i have zero experience trading and i’m kind of intimidated by the prospect of it. another thing you might be wondering is why i don’t have a car payment or fuel expense. this is because i don’t drive. my parents are toxic and never taught me. i am able to get by on getting rides from friends and neighbors to get to where i need to be, and i work from home. i’m working on getting my license now, and i anticipate getting it in the springtime. this raises another big question for me, which is whether or not i should purchase a car right away or keep doing what i’m doing until i get married. currently i have $1500 saved up for a future vehicle, and i am not sure if i should continue contributing. i also keep $200 in cash on me at all times, and i keep a random $100 in my checking as a buffer for random ach transactions i might have forgotten about.this is where i want to start talking about my girlfriend’s (26) finances. i am definitely the more financially savvy one in the relationship. i don’t want to get too specific with her exact budget since we have decided we will handle our own stuff until we get married, but essentially, she is living not far from paycheck to paycheck and has about $5000 in medical collections outstanding with no other credit history. we are trying to figure out the best way to resolve the collections debts. my hope is that she can first negotiate the collections down substantially, and that she will be able to pick up enough extra work to pay everything off and start saving. if for whatever reason this is not possible, we were thinking of using her car (paid off, worth about $8k) as collateral on a secured loan to take care of whatever is left over. ideally i’d want to put both our names on the loan because having a secured line will boost my credit, and using my credit will get her the best interest rate possible. the other thing we are thinking about doing is opening up a small $300 secured card to start her off on building a positive credit history. she also has no savings of any kind.finally, i have considerations for the marriage. we want to be as cheap as possible. i have a lot of newlywed friends who said they were able to do theirs on $5k, so that’s what i am shooting to save up. i will be working overtime this year to get us the amount needed for the wedding and all the trappings like rings and such. we will be renting, and i am reasonably sure that when we do get married the overall rent burden is going to decrease between the two of us.so to sum up, here are the different options i have worked out for my extra income. keep in mind that i anticipate an extra $800-1000 per month in incentives to play with as well. let me know which ones you feel i should go with or prioritize over the others.1. open up a side investment account with $1000. keep adding over time.2. go hard on the prepper stuff and get a year of long-term food storage, along with other self-sufficiency items like clothing, shoes, non-perishables, etc.3. continue saving for a vehicle with a down payment of $5k to ultimately purchase something reliable, or possibly as a down payment to lend for something 2-4 years old. (i am leaning toward this one to make sure me and the mrs are covered when her car bites the dust)4. pump the emergency fund some more to have about $10k in total liquid assets.5. add more to the retirement fund. i am currently sitting at about 16k, which i feel is weak for my age. employer contributes 3% when i contribute 6%, and i am currently contributing 15% for a total of 18%.6. add more to the hsa. i don’t feel the need to do this since my oop max on a family plan will be $2000, which means we’re already covered for 2 years. oop max for me individually is $1500. my employer also contributes $750 a year here.7. pay off the student loan and be debt free. i am leaning against this just because the interest loss is so minimal that i feel like it’s more beneficial to keep the credit line on my credit report for longer, but maybe i’m wrong on that.8. pass over $1000 to the future wife so she can have an emergency fund.9. start saving for a home. i plan on using a first time homebuyer program where i only need $1000 down and 100% ltv will be financed.i would also like to continue building my credit. one of my goals right now is to increase my overall credit limit to $30k. this is because i have a $10k card on a 6% interest rate (i do loans and we get an employee discount, woohoo), and this will be the only card i use for emergencies. the idea here is that if i have to max out this card in an emergency, i will cut up my 3 other cards which are vastly inferior anyway so that my utilization won’t go above 30%. currently i have a credit limit of 26-27k and i am wondering what card i should add to my deck. i am thinking of getting something with mastercard because i only have visas and i think it’s good prudence to have more than one processor. what cards would you guys recommend that don’t have monthly fees?",10,0,Turning 30 this year.

4492,"i originally posted this in fatfire reddit, asking what my likelihood of achieving fatfire was given my circumstances. wasn’t really met with good greetings, and maybe i don’t want to actually fatfire. sure, i’d love to be a multimillionaire by forty, but it probably is out of the question now. i still would like to hit a couple million by retirement age, at least. even if that means fifty/sixty, especially if i’m happy in my career. i am f, 31-ish, not married, no kids, unemployed for going on six years. i have a ba in literature and worked for a few months in office management (office + distribution coordinator) before a downward spiral. story: i was working in film (dream career), got sick with an autoimmune disease that practically disabled me for the five years it was failing to be diagnosed, and couldn’t work. i finally got diagnosed last year only a few months before the pandemic hit. of course i got sick with covid, severely. that was another six months down and out from long hauler symptoms. i’m doing better on all fronts, but i am so shit on paper now, and i feel really lost when it comes to employment/career path now. i always wanted to work in film, that was the plan, i really think it’s moot now. i’m pretty broke and can’t imagine starting at the beginning because they bank on free work, which i can no longer afford. i feel like i’m an extremely capable person, but am paralyzed by not knowing what to do, and being shit on paper, and the pandemic...and being out for so long. there’s no reason to hire me for any real job making real money, especially right now. i come from a terrible money background. parent (only parent) totally financially illiterate. horrible money decisions. is out of work right now and totally broke, nothing to their name. i do not want to be like this at all. it’s always been my worst fear in life.  family didn’t ever teach anything about money even though they were doing well and in middle class, money was a taboo topic. my grandmother didn’t even want to tell me how much she sold her house for, type of toxic financial bs. like i wanted to steal her money or something, type of paranoia vibes. when i got sick i almost became homeless, which was a shock because i grew up middle class, and even received a very decent inheritance from grandparents i never met. blew most of it due to financial illiteracy and no direction from anyone—i was eighteen through early twenties. and paying off college upfront, which i regret. i spent most of my sick time learning about money and finances. really proud of myself for that because i’m pretty well versed on personal finance now. i have a lot of information and education on that front, but no real income to implement it. and again, i feel so lost on how i will achieve this income at this point. i have to eventually or i’m screwed, and it would just be ridiculous to waste my abilities, but i feel super lost. i only have about $20k left from inheritance. took 75% out of market for emergency fund during this. left 25% in. surviving on parent’s unemployment + very minor savings. idk if this is far off or dumb, but can someone analyze my situation or give me some advice? can i also be told bluntly what my chances of achieving financial success are at this rate? i almost feel like this is a bad question outside of fatfire. i’m aware enough to know i have a chance to work and create some type of decent financial life, even if it’s later than i’d originally planned. again, i just feel really lost and depressed about my situation. not even sure what i’m looking for here.",13,1,Likelihood Of Achieving Financial Success After Hardship?,Finance
4495,"i'm a university student who currently still lives with their parents. i will be graduating in a few years, at the age of 29 (i'm 26 currently). i might go study abroad for the last two years of my studies, but most expenses would be covered by scholarships and to a lesser degree by my parents as much as they can afford. i might also get a part-time job as a tutor to help. but right now, i don't have any debt, and i'm not planning to have one in the future either, at least not for education. and even if i *had* to get a loan, i really don't want it to exceed 10k.on the other hand, i haven't started saving or investing in anything at all. my allowance for the past few years in university has been around 15$-ish a week (in total around 400$ a year). i wanted to save a bit, but with transport costs and food and school supplies, i only ended up saving 100$ last year. and, at the end of the year, i ended up spending those too on a sudden project we had to do at uni. this year, concerning allowance, i only got 20$ since the beginning of the school year in september. because allowance to them isn't a regular sum i get weekly/monthly, but as long as i have money in my purse, they usually won't give me full allowance, like, if i had 3$ of the 15$ that i didn't spend from last week, they'll give me 12$ so my total is at 15$ again for the week after, etc. so this year, as most studies were at home due to the pandemic, i never really went outside and rarely spent anything, so they ""updated"" my allowance literally one time. and due to this policy, i never managed to save anything for two years of uni, only last year i kept insisting on getting a full allowance every week, so i managed to save a bit (before that emergency project came to be). as a side note, during middle and high school, and my first 3 years of higher education, i never received any allowance money and spendings were case by case, so if i needed to buy something for school or eat outside or even buy some luxury stuff, they'd just give me the exact sum needed right then and there, and if there was any money left, i give it back to them. it's not that they didn't want me to have money, they just don't find the importance of me getting allowance as i live with them and say i don't need it (until i started living at the university dorms these past 4 years). it's not that we're poor (well, by my country's standard of living, not the western standards, i'm in a 3rd world country), but idk, they just prefer paying for me when i request something rather than me getting my own money and managing it.anyways, i want to start saving money and investing specifically, and always wanted for the past few years, because i know the sooner you start the better. but for the love of god i can't seem to ever manage to save enough to invest in anything with the allowance i have. and i only graduate in a few years as i said, so until then, i am financially dependent on my parents. and even when i keep i should (and wanted) to get a part-time job to better support myself financially and make my own decisions on saving and spendings, but both my psyachiatrist and my parents don't allow me to do so (for health reasons mostly, i don't really... deal well with pressure and stress, heck my psychiatrist even tells me to take it easy with school haha). so when i tell my parents that i need to work to save money for the future, they tell me they'll make deposits for me in my bank account, but no matter how many times i remind them, they do it once or twice (not a big sum either, like 20$ at a time), and then they forget again for years. and when i ask again after a while i'm shocked everytime that they've neglected to do it.i'm out of ideas and alternatives. i'm starting to think i should just ignore the doctor's advice and just start working, and whatever happens happens. at this rate i'll be a financial failure in the future. if i listen to the three of them, i won't even be allowed to make the startup that i've always been dreaming about.so, if i start working part-time next year (after i finish the entrance exams of this year), and start investing and savig money, or maybe at most when i graduate, would it be too late for me? i still have a chance to catch up and have a good financial portfolio, right?and if you have any suggestions on how to proceed in my situation, i'd appreciate it a lot.thanks in advance.",30,1,Is it too late to start saving and investing at 27-29?,Finance

5941,"hoping to get some advice on how to best move forward with my tax/finance situation for 2021 since it is a bit more complicated than what i'm used to. i've gotten a significant raise and will have stock options vesting this year. on top of that i am doing some 1099 contract work on the side which is providing some additional income. i'm planning to max out my traditional 401k through my company for this year and will still be above the income limit for roth ira contributions. some specific questions i have are:  1. does it make sense to move my traditional ira (\~20k) into my companies 401k (which i believe they allow) in order to make backdoor roth contributions?2. since i'll have income as an independent contractor it seems i'm eligible for either a solo 401k or a sep ira. if i do open a sep ira, it seems i could also rollover my traditional ira into that account as well which would open up backdoor opportunities.3. i could also convert my traditional ira entirely to roth now since retirement for me is at least 20+ years off? i'm in the fortunate position of having a relatively low cost of living compared to my income at this time thanks to remote work.4. with the sep ira, i believe i can contribute up to 25% of my net 1099 earnings on top of what i am normally able to do as an employee since those contributions are considered employer contributions?5. stock options are treated as income as far as taxes are concerned the moment they vest right? if i were to sell immediately at/close to the vesting price, it is effectively all income and not capital gains? is there any real reason i would choose to hang on to those stocks? in my mind, not selling is the same thing as buying so it really only makes sense to hold if i thought the stocks would benefit my overall portfolio? i have my funds pretty much entirely within vanguard index funds/target date funds.6. i've looked into things like turbotax live or vanguard personal advisor but not sure if it would be worth it for me. i currently have funds in several different target dates spread between my traditional and roth ira. i don't think the spread i have now is optimal. i could also start investing in my brokerage account that i have with them (potentially in addition to the sep ira). it seems in this case it may make sense to go with the advisor as they could more optimally distribute the funds between taxable/non-taxable accounts?  as far as i can workout, the cost to me would be an expense ratio of 0.30% compared to my target date funds? if they were to reallocate into actual index funds rather than the target date funds it seems the actual increase in expense ratio would be minimal since the index funds already have a lower expense ratio compared to the target date funds.i guess it also makes sense to clarify what my end goal is. i have \*some\* cash sitting in my emergency funds right now. this should cover about 6 months or so of expenses right now. i don't have debt anymore (thankfully) or any real financial obligations (mortgage, auto loans, kids, etc.) at the moment so my thought is to try and invest as much as possible now (even though we are at a potential high point??). for me, funds in cash tends to get spent so moving funds out of my checking account is also a bit of a goal.",3,1,Need help planning out 2021 finances,Finance

are living closeby. we are fortunate to have had a lot of research fellowships + inheritance from our loved ones who have passed over the years and we are hoping that we can stretch what we have saved and received to purchase a home.# financial info:* **income:** combined income of \~100k/yr (incl. supplement of part-time work)* **debt:** only debt is a \~27k car loan at 0% over 5y on a new, reliable car (required)* **savings:** we have \~100k liquid savings, \~10-15k in stocks, \~50k in roth ira total.* **credit**: 750-799* **expenses:** current renting costs (absolute total) = $2013/mo.* **govt program eligibility:** ineligible. fha loans are not an option, not competitive for hcol areas.# area-specific information:* most buildings in our area are 80-100+ years old. these homes can be more expensive to maintain (utilities &amp; mandatory repair/remodel costs). many are converted to multi-family or flipped to million dollar properties.* the property value in these areas is projected 7+% growth over the next year and has had stable growth historically, even 2008. there's no substantial 2020-suburb surge (houses sell around asking), but these markets are still ""hot"". it is also undergoing a lot of residential and commercial development, i would not be surprised if growth is higher than projected.# here's where we'd love your feedback:we originally planned to buy a house in 2-3 years, but our situation recently changed. **one of us will soon be receiving between 200-230k in the next 2 weeks.** as such, we are considering moving up our timeline.* the housing budget we set for this purchase will be unchanged even when our incomes increase after graduating. we'd like to allocate that surplus to boost our retirement/savings and/or childcare expenses (can be 4k+/mo our here).* in this area, the 33% guideline for housing expenses is not realistic unless you're reasonably wealthy, for renting or buying.* the price range of habitable single-family homes is **6-750k.** anything with lower price is uninhabitable, has major issues, or doesn't exist.* price range of habitable condos/townhomes that would be big enough over the next 5-7y is 500-750k.  anything with lower price ranges would only be suitable short-term.# here is our thinking:* we *want* and are ready to be home-owners. our families taught us a lot about this.* the 200k+ (and the 100k liquid) was intended for a down-payment whether we buy now or later. if we put it in the stock market instead, it would only be in low-risk mutual/index funds and would likely not appreciate at the same rate of a home. cds would be even lower return.* if the market skyrockets in this area, we want to get in before. if it doesn't, we're still ok.* interest rates are low.* moving to another area is not an option except in situations of catastrophic family emergency.* given our backgrounds, even conservatively, we don't expect that there will be job-market issues - even in times of economic collapse.* if we can get a single family home with potential for expansion/renovation, we could stay 10+ years. this is ideal for us.* we are also considering homes in multi-family residences that would be suitable long-term, but these homes are inherently restricted in terms of expansion and have complications out of our control (neighbors). they appreciate at a lower rate. few places exist that are more dated because  they are bought by flippers -- unlikely to be able to save money with purchase price.* if we don't buy a place, we would need to stay where we are (we really would like to avoid this) or rent another place. renting another apt in this area almost always requires 1 month realtor fee, security (we don't have a security deposit at the moment) and any costs associated with moving. we are motivated to move due to health concerns in the building.# here is our biggest concern:* our incomes are low (and subsequently lending potential), so we need to put a substantial amount down to afford any of these places. if we have to use our capital for a downpayment, we worry about paying for unanticipated expensive repairs - which is especially of concern with century old homes.* we would have to get another car, public-transport accessible areas are way out of our price range (by 2-300k for a tiny condo). parking at school for this additional car is \~500$ a month (sigh), but that would be a short-term cost (until graduation). longer commutes can only be accommodated after graduation.* we both have no family financial backup and value financial security over everything else.* we aren't just considering mortgage, but also insurance &amp; utilities, including life &amp; disability insurance if not too expensive.we're looking forward to your feedback!! buying a house out here is so expensive - i have no clue how people manage to afford to buy out here most of the time. thanks in advance:)",16,2,Buy or Rent in HCOL area,Finance

6600,"hello! my fiancée and i are considering buying a house. the mortgage payment would be cheaper/comparable to what we pay in rent and the in-laws are willing to give some financial assistance in the form of covering anything that needs fixing/replacing at move-in and acting as a general safety net.here's our current situation:**income: $5600** (reduced due to covid. we're expecting $7100+ once one of our job situations returns to normal or change, hopefully february. this is after pre-tax deductions for retirement)**debt: $2000** minimum monthly payment (significantly less right now due to covid). we have $272k student debt. 155k is in a 5.7% government loan that's on a 15 year forgiveness plan with income-based payments. 80k are sallie mae loans with ~9% variable interest rates that we're trying to refinance. the remaining 38k are 1.1%(government) or 3.2% (refinanced) fixed apr loans.**rent: $1500****utilities (electric, gas, internet): $170****car/life/renter insurances: $90****groceries: $400** my father-in-law graciously pays for all his offspring's dash-pass orders, so this is really just groceries.**other (netflix/etc): $80****unspent: $1400** usually less due to other costs. we typically save about $1000 a month.our front-end dti is 26%. our back-end dti is 61%.we have about 25k we can put towards a down payment/closing costs without hurting our emergency fund (11k). that would afford us a 240k house in our area, which has some homes we're interested in. the mortgage for that would run ~$1370. we have been pre-approved for that amount.the in-laws are willing to support us if things pop up, so we have that safety net if things exceed our worst case scenarios. in an *absolute worst case*, we can rent out the home and move in with them. we see a lot of personal/qol value in buying a home. the main cons are we'd be taking out the mortgage on top of our loans and we'd be spending a bit over half of our (current) income on rent and monthly payments (which we do already).so my financial questions are...1. is this reasonable? are we being hopeful? is this affordable given our budgets and costs?2. is there a better option that would result in buying a home?  1. we're willing to make less-than-ideal (not destructive, but also not min-maxing) financial choices if it means getting into a home sooner than later. we do not want to wait 10-15 years to buy a home. 2. i would prefer not to move in with my in-laws to save money, but i am considering it. 3. there's a less clear option of moving into her parent's condo... but they have a tenant there who they can't evict right now due to covid (the tenant ceased paying rent and is not communicative so they're not too keen on keeping on them) and it's unclear how long that will persist. we don't love the condo or the area, but it would be rent-free which more than makes up for it.i know those last two options are probably our best choices and we're actively purusing the condo, so i would particularly appreciate advice beyond them. thank you!",0,1,Seeking advice - Buying a house with large student loans?,Finance

7022,"i (27f) consider myself a saver more than spender and would say i'm fairly financially-wise, but am a little torn right now as far as what my debt vs savings plan should be. i'm going to include all the details i think are important, so sorry for this being so long.financial overview: i went to a small private college to get my bachelor's and accumulated ~$33k in student loans. i've paid a little more than half of that over the last 5 years; my current principal balance is $14,600 with an average interest rate of 4.4%. i had one private loan that i paid off first, and have since been working on my federal loans. i pay a little extra every month and usually a small lump-sum with my tax return. i currently have 4 federal loans (previously 5; one paid off entirely) with the following balances/rates: $4k@4.1%, $4k@3.61%, $3k@6.55%, $2k@3.15%. i put all extra payments towards the 6.55% loan. for the past 7 months, since federal loans currently have no interest, i've been putting my monthly would-be payment into a hysa (0.5%apr) instead with the plan of making a lump-sum payment before interest is set to accrue again...and with pipedreams of loan forgiveness, which i know is incredibly unlikely. i've been keeping track of what portion of my savings is intended for my loans.i had been driving a 20+ year old car until i bought a new one in 2019. i know i shouldn't have bought new, but wanted to live a little (also bought a sensible vehicle). i put $6k down and financed $23k @2.99%. that balance is currently at about $15k. in an ideal world i'll pay that off early, too, but that's not my current focus.i have excellent credit (800+) and two credit cards. i use my credit cards to pay for basically everything to get cash back, but always pay the full balance and have never carried a balance. the only debt i have are my auto and student loans.i've got around $11k in savings, which includes about $3k earmarked for student loans. my current monthly base take-home pay is ~$2,400 with base expenses (rent, car insurance, car payment, student loans, utilities, etc.) of $1,710 + ~$640/month budgeted for gas, food, pets, miscellaneous expenses. i also work a second, part-time job which earns me an additional variable income of about ~$200/month net pay. i have $300/month put directly into my savings (i know i should be saving more) and try to put any extra money i may have into my savings as well. i try to follow a zero-based budgeting method as best as i can, but am certainly not perfect. i am actively seeking a new job which would hopefully have a yearly salary of $60k+, but of course i know better than to count my chickens before my eggs hatch.here's my question: i am looking to purchase a home hopefully in the next 6 months or so. i would be purchasing the home with my partner, who has about twice the savings i do, but a similar salary (also looking for a better job). my first instinct is to put that earmarked $3k and maybe a little more towards my student loans, but then i question whether i should prioritize saving for the cost of a home/downpayment. i know, either way, we'll almost certainly be paying pmi. i'm already slated to pay off my student loans about 2 years early, and i know i could just keep making my monthly payment once 0% interest stops, no harm no foul, the loans will still be there after i buy a house. especially with no interest accrual right now, it's very tempting to just keep the earmarked money in my savings. i could also just pay the $3k loan @6.55% which would bring my average interest rate for the rest to 3.85%, which isn't terrible. i also feel like this is the best time to attack my loans since there is no interest and i would still have enough in my savings for an emergency fund and a small amount to put towards the house, but i'd really like to have more in my savings. it's not like my student loans have crazy high interest rates, so the yearly interest isn't costing me a fortune, but i know the longer i take to pay off the loans, the more money i'm losing in the long run.any advice about what i should prioritize or maybe an alternate strategy i haven't thought of would be much appreciated. thanks in advance!!",91,1,The age-old question: Should I focus on paying off student loans or saving for a house?

7604,"hello.if this isn’t the subreddit for this i apologize. i am just trying to get advice and perspective from people outside of my family. i know this is long so bear with me please. i understand i am very lucky to have grown up in the household i did, and i am fortunate this was even a possibility at my age. i live in northern california. during the summer of 2019, my brother and i went in together to purchase a house as co-owners in northern california where we live. at the time, i was 21 and my brother was 20. my parents had saved up during our childhoods for my brother and i to go to college. this money was in two separate accounts, one for each of us. he and i chose to go to trade schools and got scholarships along the way, so we never had to touch those funds. we decided to use these funds, about $40,000 each, towards a down payment on a home we’d be purchasing together. even with the two of us coming together, we were still short on the amount for the down payment, so my grandma gave us the rest to use for the down payment. we acquired the house and agreed everything would be split 50/50 between my brother and i: mortgage, utilities, bills, etc. our mortgage was $2400/month.my brother immediately moved his girlfriend into the house, which i was against. i didn’t want another roommate and he forced one on me. because she still had thousands of dollars left in student loans, she wasn’t able to pay rent or bills. the only bill my brother started paying 2/3 for was the water bill. this was the case from june 2019 to december 2019, so half a year. starting january 1, 2020, everything was split in thirds. april 2020, my brother and his girlfriend had a baby, so now it’s the three of them and me in the house. because of covid, interest rates were very low, so we decided to refinance the house with a different lender. this brought our interest rate down a considerable amount. we finalized the refinance in november 2020, and the original loan was paid off. there is no payment due for december. january 2021 starts the new reduced payment. i had applied for a new job in april 2020, and officially got the job. i start this month. i moved out of the house in northern california and got my own apartment in southern california where the new job is. my brother and his girlfriend are taking over the full cost of the mortgage and bills, even though i’m still a part owner of the property. i will be paying for half of the property taxes though. we also had our sewer lateral replaced this year, which we had to finance. we split the payment equally. one of the motives for us refinancing was to make it affordable for them to live on their own in the house. &amp;#x200b;my brother and my mom put together an agreement they want me to sign. here is the agreement they came up with. i have edited the document to exclude personal identifying information:we, “*me*” and “*brother*”, entered into a mortgage agreement together for the property at “*address*” on june 5, 2019. the original loan amount was $389,500, held with “*first lender*”. each party contributed equally towards the down payment.on november 23, 2020, “*me*” and “*brother*” entered into a new refinance mortgage agreement together, held with “*new lender*”. the new loan amount is $385,450. the new appraised value of the above-named property was $520,975.both parties agree that all equity before the refinance will be split equally between them 50/50 (the difference between the new appraised value and the original loan amount = $135,525) and both parties will recoup their portion of the down payment, as long as the value of the property allows.both parties agree that any equity after the refinance will be split 1/3 to ""*me*"", 2/3 to ""*brother*"", with the following exception(s):both parties entered into an agreement with “*plumbing contractor*” on august 21, 2020 for the repair of the main sewer line at the above property address. the original loan amount was $13,594.14, payable over five years. the monthly payment is $270. each party agreed to pay 50% of the monthly payment until the loan is paid off, or the above property is sold, whichever comes first. “me” will receive back 1/3 plus $45/month for each month of the total money he paid towards the sewer loan out of the new equity when the above property is sold. the upkeep and maintenance of the above-named property is the responsibility of “*brother*” as long as he lives on the property. both parties agree that any major repairs needed at the above property will be the responsibility of both parties in the following amounts: “*me*” will pay 1/3, “brother” will pay 2/3.all money due monthly for house payment expenses and sewer line loan will be paid out the joint checking account “*account number*” held by “*me*” and “*brother*” at “*first lender bank*”. surplus money held in the joint account will be used only for emergency house purposes agreed upon by both parties.“*me*” vacated the above-named property to live in “*southern california*” for his new job on december 1, 2020. “*me*”, as a courtesy, gave opportunity to “*brother*” to find a roommate of his choosing to fill the vacancy. “*brother*”, along with his live-in girlfriend, “*brother’s girlfriend*”, chose not to have a roommate, and would assume the monthly mortgage payment of principal and interest in the amount of $1599.20, with the first payment due january 1, 2021. “*brother*” and “*brother’s girlfriend*” are responsible for all utilities expenses at the property.both “*me*” and “*brother*” agree to pay 50% of the monthly property taxes and homeowners insurance due for the escrow account held on the new refinanced mortgage. the approximate monthly escrow amount $575, and both parties understand that the property taxes are not a fixed amount and may be subject to change according to city and county taxes, and changes in homeowner insurance premiums. “*me*” remains part owner of the above-named property and is entitled to the tax write-off as set forth by law. in the event that the relationship between “*brother*” and his live-in girlfriend “*brother’s girlfriend*” dissolves, or “*brother*” and “*brother’s girlfriend*” are unable to make the monthly mortgage payment, “*me*” and “*brother*” agree that the above property will be listed for sale and sold immediately.if either party decides they want to sell the property for any reason other than noted above, they must provide the other party a minimum of 90 days’ notice in writing.if said property is sold, “*me*” and “*brother*” agree that all equity money will be held in joint accounts with their parents, “*mother*” and/or “*father*”, until either party decides to purchase a new home independently. both parties agree the equity money is intended for the sole purpose of purchasing property.any future changes to this agreement must be discussed between “*me*” and “*brother*”, and a written addendum to this agreement must be signed and dated in front of a notary public.&amp;#x200b;i ask for advice on the situation. should we have this agreement looked at by a lawyer before signing? are the contents of the agreement fair for everyone involved? it is also my understanding that for us to sell the house, he and i both would need to agree to sell. this agreement however includes a way for me to sell the house if i wanted to as long as i give 90 days’ notice. what happens if my brother refuses to sell? will this signed document hold up in court? we will be signing in

7977, i just refinanced my house and pulled out 100k in equity taking my loan from 200k at 4.5% interest 30 year fixed to 300k at 2.875% 30 year fixed. previously i had been paying a couple hundred extra a month towards the loan principal and was going to keep doing that as the monthly payments are only a little more now. reading here and doing some research it looks like i am better off investing that money as it will likely exceed any interest savings since the interest on the loan is so low.      it looks like i can contribute 6k a year to a roth and in eleven years when i am over 59 i can pull either contributions or interest without penalty - so if for example i wanted to pay down my mortgage i could pull some or all of it without it being taxed. i already max my 401k every year which in the next few years will keep my adjusted income in the range where i can continue contributing to the roth (i am assuming that adjusted income is counted after 401k contributions). i wanted to see if there were any specific types of accounts that i could contribute to if i have more i want to put away after those. i have a 30k emergency fund and generally put away about 1k a month if i am not being frivolous with spending.     i got a late start in life with career and saving so i am trying to play catch up and i am very new to investing. i tend to be very conservative but was thinking that with some of that extra money i could find something with some potentially higher returns. would other accounts be subject to capital gains and would that offset the benefit of investing vs. paying down the mortgage? i have run a bunch of numbers through amortization calculators and investment calculators but i am still kind of confused about tax implications for some of them.      my original plan had been to try to pay off the house in about 15-20 years and then save as aggressively as i could with the catch-up allowance on the 401k but now the mortgage seems like “cheap” money and i could put it to better use elsewhere. any advice is appreciated.,15,1,Roth IRA vs. extra house payments.,Finance

8522,"hi all,i am a 34m with a 32f spouse, a three year old son and two dogs. i am starting to get a little worried about retirement and having a college fund for my son. we have always been conscious about a budget. since we dropped our savings into a new house a few years ago, we have gotten lazy and ignored where money is going.the more i read into investing, retirement and where to put money, the more i get confused, especially the tax implications. i need advice on what do with our current cash, and how to adjust our 401k's moving forward to right the ship.assets - house valued at approximately 480k (zestimate), 23k in traditional 401k from previous employer, 25k in pension (school system, possibly more than double due to matching, need to verify), 21k in cash (will double in 2-3 months, explained later), about 40k in two vehicles, 1k in new roth 401k from new employer, brand new 403bmonthly payments:mortgage - 2254 - just refinanced 373k for 30 years at 2.875%. house appraised value on loan is 460k so paying pmi for about another 2 years at 54 a monthdaycare - 1565utilities - 400 - internet, electric, water, gas, spotifycar payment - 500 - just bought a new plug-in hybrid 2021 rav4 prime. 28k for 60 months at 2.14% will basically never have to pay for gas nor extra electric due to my commuting requirements and free charger at work.car insurance - 160groceries - 300miscellaneous/fun - 600 - gas, pets, home warranty, dining out, alcohol, entertainment, vacations, etc.combined income - 145k - 78k + 67k - take home is currently about 8k per monthzero student loans or credit card debt. we exclusively used credit cards for most purchases to get the additional rewards, and pay statement balances every month to avoid interest.my initial thoughts on a game plan:the doubling in current cash will be due to no mortgage payments until february, escrow refund from previous mortgage and our tax refund. getting a cool 7500 federal tax credit for purchasing a phev!by my calculations, we have about 2,200 coming into cash every month. let's just call it 2000 due to estimation in miscellaneous/fun and groceries categories.adjust the 401k on the 78k salary from 5% roth to 25% traditional. luckily my plan gives the option, and to even split. it would bump from 150 to 750. i started this job in june, and previous employer for two years didn't only offered a roth with no matching and didn't do it, so really got behind on retirement/investing. (i think) this will near max it out, as well as lower our taxable income a considerable amount. this will bring us down about 1200 per month, so should still have 500+ surplus in cash every month.keep 25k in a high yield savings account for an emergency fund. we are almost done with a basement remodel. will cost about another 5k to finish.get rid of pmi:1. may 2021 will be five years since owning our house, and we would only have to pay about 5k towards principal to get under 80% loan to value.2. once the carpet is installed in two weeks, get a 500 dollar reappraisal. i'm 100% confident the reappraisal will be at least 467000, which will put us under 80% ltv. two houses sold in our neighborhood for 500k+ this year, so we could even hit 75% ltv if the appraisal is 497k+.3. correct me if i'm wrong, but everything i'm reading states it doesn't matter what the lender/contract says. once ltv and ownership hits the threshold, and you can request it be taken off, and they have to abide (dude).if all my math is right, we will have about 10-15k left over in cash.  what should i do with the extra 10-15k? roth ira? 529 for college? bumping emergency fund to 30k may not be a bad idea. we are trying for a second kid, tbd at the moment. keep in savings to have in 12-14 months for additional daycare costs?should i do anything with the old 401k or just let it sit? it's in a target date fund, and the return was 10.79% this year thus far.thanks in advance! i've already learned so much from this subreddit, and will be forever grateful for the knowledge and experiences shared to it.",8,1,Rebalancing 401k and Cash,Finance

9301,"hi all,i’d really appreciate any advice here as i’m fairly new in this and i’ve only had internships and one fte role in the field. i basically am being recruited for one of the faang companies (facebook, amazon, apple, netflix, google) by a consulting company who hires contractors for company let’s call it “big”. unfortunately, all previous attempts to apply for these big roles directly, i don’t think are even being seen. long story short recruiter told me the upper range of what they can offer is the same salary level at what they believe i currently make fte as it’s more “junior”. i said i’d only consider leaving for something equal to my pay in the case of benefits that counter it, otherwise it would obviously have to be more. he said ok and we continued, i’ve done some interviews and they have all gone well so far and i am truly qualified for this position. i also found the role on big’s company site and even based on all of the interview questions it is definitely *not* junior in any way shape or form. there is no pto from what i understand (haven’t read through contract, just doing research) and of course just loss of benefits such as implied insecurity from being a contractor. in addition they claim there is the opportunity for w2 hire direct by big but as the contractors on the team i spoke to have all been contractors close to 2 years, i doubt this will happen and i’ve heard similar from people i know working at other faangs. i did some digging on the role and found that the pay grade for this role seems to be 91k yet recruiter is claiming 65k is upper range (what i currently make). i know of course contractor are always a little under paid in this scenario. but not by 26k. i think they’re aware no one is going to leave fte for contract work at the same salary level unless they were foolish. i can only see this happening in the reverse, equal salary but added benefits and security. what leverage do i have here and what do you suggest? there aren’t many negative reviews for the contracting company other than the standard, “this is contracting work, there are few benefits”.**with the knowledge that the direct hire pay grade for this role seems to be roughly 91k, the recruiter claiming upper range is 65k which is where i am currently, and taking into account loss of fte security and benefits, how much should i negotiate for? **￼i am willing to take risk generally￼ as i very much dislike my current role and have a decent amount of savings/emergency fund. while my current job *is* secure and flexible, there is very little room for growth both financially and even experience-wise/title. i recently found out i make 15k less than all my male colleagues as well so that’s fun! i also think it would be a good plan as even though i doubt i’ll become a direct hire for big, i can eventually use this big contract experience to become a direct hire fte at another faang in future. this seems to be the lifecycle of those in the industry who don’t have another “in”. in addition, i am not the sole provider, have no children and am on my husbands insurance plan which has great coverage and he is fte and has a secure job. am also on a second healthcare plan under my parents for another year or so. so i am not technically worried about health coverage but do want to factor this into my compensation as they don’t need to know this.thank you so much for any help you can provide. if i left anything out or could clarify anything please let me know!",6,1,How much more to ask for in order to jump ship from FTE to contractor role for FAANG company?,Finance

(this could change, he does need to go to the doctor soon so it’ll help us with the math)now as i understand it pet insurance is almost always more expensive than simply paying out of pocket, with the biggest benefit being a more consistent payment and protection from a large medical expense. - when it comes to deductibles would a higher or lower deductible be better? if our yearly expenses are ~$500 minus emergencies would we want a lower deductible to get reimbursement? - usaa’s pre existing and non-coverage policy seems okay at a first glance, and our dog doesn’t have any issues which would qualify as pre existing. this would hopefully maximize insurance benefits for us. - we could afford an emergency right now, but with my income slowly rising and living in m/hcol area it would be a pretty tough hit to the savings. similar to my gf who has an even harder time. so this would be a nice weight off our shoulders for the next 3-4yrs. - a $5k reimbursement limit, $500 deduct, and 80% reimbursement would be $30/m so $360/year in just insurance but with a deductible that high would we even benefit from insurance if everything is fine with the dog? even working through the math after typing this out i guess it doesn’t seem like an amazing idea, but i wouldn’t mind some opinions from people with more experience in this. i’m new to living on my own and dealing with my own insurance so a lot of this is new/complicated to me right now.",7,1,Considering Pet Insurance - a little unsure of how it all works together.,Finance

10357,"i am 24 y/o male. i was accepted into physician assistant school, and will potentially starting in the coming months. throughout undergrad and postgrad life, i had dedicated all my time to get into pa school. i took full-time course load(graduated with 3.8+ in bio), sacrificed friends, family time, worked multiple jobs, volunteered, etc. while i do like medicine and helping others, i mainly chose this path because it seemed the straight and narrow path to landing a 100k+ salary after 2 years with decent work-life balance.i assumed i was going to get into a high paying specialty like orthopedics/ emergency med and land a 150k+ position. very naive/optimistic of me and i am now trying to think of the most realistic timeline for me. realistically, i would be getting a position paying 90-110k out of pa school(2 year program), and possibly capping out around 130-140k and moonlighting to get a salary of 150k for the rest of my life.ultimately, i will be ending pa school with \~120k debt, earning 100k my first 2 years. by then, in terms of fire, it would take me an additional 3 years of frugal living(age 29) to pay off all debts and achieve a net worth of 0. so by then, my net worth would not be really accruing until age 30.on the other side of the fence, i was thinking of heading into computer science(entering a 6 month bootcamp). trust me, i understand the rigor and the level of the aptitude needed to break into tech, as i will be competing against others who have coded since they were kids, ivy/top tier unis, international students, etc., but i truly believe if i dedicated my time to anything, i would be able to achieve it. that being said, i want to go with a conservative timeline of taking about 1-2 years of landing an entry level position, possibly paying 30-50k(again, conservative numbers). by then, i could work there for a year, and hop to another position possibly earning 70k+ for 2-5 years while actively pursing higher-paying companies(fang, etc.) with 6 years of experience, i'd still be age 30 with a career that outpaces pa salary by a mile (200k-500k, realistically, 200-250k range).that being said, i understand it is best to follow your passion, and the money would follow. thing is, i am not particularly passionate about either. i enjoy/like medicine, but the compensation just does not seem to be there, and i have read from many that eventually, they see it as a means to an end. i also, for the past 2 months, have been self-teaching myself python, and genuinely enjoyed it as well.i am trying my best to really understand myself, and i think the biggest thing i want out of life is to be financially free. i have grown on the lower side of the income bracket, and i wish to be able to retire(or at the very least support them substantially), live in a nice neighborhood(nothing too extravagant), and to have the freedom to have options because money wouldn't be an issue(travel, go to concerts, spend time with loved ones, etc.) all of this, of course needs to be added that i plan to stay in california(hcol) so a 100-120k wouldn't take me very far (in terms of my financial goals/lifestyle).am i wrong to think that 120k salary would not allow for a comfortable lifestyle? i wish to support a family one day(possibly a kid) and my future wife, and i'm not sure if i am limiting myself by going the pa route.",22,1,Should I Stay as a PA or Do Computer Science?,Finance

10515,using a throwaway account.my company has been sold to another company.  they pretty much told us out of the blue and was a huge surprise to everyone. the new company is bigger and of course all the benefits are not the same.  i will not go into the nitty gritty but from the looks of it they are downgrading our benefits even when they say that they are trying to keep them as close as possible.  the new company also has a pretty tight non-compete.  i have a friend in another state that i have worked with before and told me a job is available at his company. the days in between this change and the job availability was probably only 2 days. the higher ups at his company want the original contractors that were at the plant because we knew it better than the people that were hired. probably also the reason he is the manager now since he knew that place better than anyone.i am going to apply but there are pros and cons to both and want to see if there are things i need to think about or maybe someone just saying which seems to be better.  i have had pretty bad luck with jobs like i stay when i really should go and when i start to feel good in the job something seems to happen outside of my control (company before this one went bankrupt).  i always seem to pick the wrong thing.company 1 = buying companycompany 2 = company friend works at.both seem to have the same pay with cost of living adjustments but going to talk with friend some more since he is the hiring manager. don't know about the exact benefits of company 2 since it has changed hands since i was contracted there.company 1 pros: don't have to move (i am tired of moving). can be challenging but recent project is the same and will be the same for the next year.  company's values seem to align with mine. mostly regular hours.company 1 cons: will probably have to work in another state close to a full year due to upcoming project/covid-19. company says that they are trying to make sure that their benefits are close to the original ones but give me the feeling of empty promises or just will say this now so until you sign stuff. the non-compete is pretty harsh and could limit my ability to work in the same field for up to a year (don't know if company 2 has a non-compete but from what i know they do not). company 2 pros: consistent schedule.  very little travel.  worked with the boss before when he was a coworker/friend. know many of the people there and i know they would want me back since i seemed to always make them happy.  some of my friends live in that area and would be excited to see me come back.company 2 cons: work m-f 3-11pm (isn't bad but could be better). on call on some weekends but it would be mostly over the phone help since there will be people there that should know how to fix most things. working for a boss that used to be a coworker and could ruin friendship (don't have many of them to spare). would have to move back to an area that was okay but didn't really enjoy.i don't have any major debts only student loans that i am paying off aggressively when i have extra money. renting at the moment and my renewal is in march so this would be the time to do it. have more than 10 months in an emergency fund and i know that it is overkill but i have found this works for me by making me feel secure and my ocd with the amount in there.i am sorry if this is not enough information since i need to keep it vague enough not to get in trouble but give enough that people can help with it. i can add more information to any questions.  i looked at the lists of both and still have no clue which way to go.  thanks for everyone's time.,4,1,Advice on picking between jobs,Finance

10699,"this is probably going to be long and rambling, i have been tumbling these thoughts around in my head for the past week, so my apologies in advance.  this is really more like 5 questions, but i have made the main question the title.last week i took my car in for it's annual inspection, and was told that there was so much wrong with it (including needing a new frame) that it was not worth repairing (2003 buick lesabre that i have had since 2013).  i was caught by surprise since it passed inspection at a different shop last year, and i have driven it less than 1k miles this year due to working remotely, but i guess the other shop that inspected it last year didn't actually check anything...anyway, i am in the position of unexpectedly needing a new car now.  i have gone back and forth about what to get, and i have been really wanting a truck for quite some time.  i have been scouring car and dealership sites for the past week getting to know the market, and i am still undecided between a new truck in the 35-42k range, a used truck in the 35k area, or something else that i don't really want, but will get me around, in the 15-20k range (current frontrunners are a 15k minivan or a 20k suv).  if i go for the truck options i want to keep the payment under 600 a month and no more than 60 months on the loan.  if i go option 3, i may just pay it straight in cash and not finance at all, haven't decided yet.here is the financial information needed to understand my question in the next part:**annual income: 137k salary + 0-25k in bonuses** depending on company and personal performance (this year i only got 14k, due to the company not performing as well due to the economy)**emergency fund: 30k****student loan balance: 23k****student loan monthly payment: $900****student loan payoff budget: 30k** (i have had this saved since my loan balance was 30k, but been nervous to spend it because of economic uncertainty, and have not rebudgeted the excess money yet)**car repair budget: 2k****house down payment budget: 18k****amount saved each month (currently toward house down payment budget): 1k-3k** (depending on other expenses/fun stuff)no other debt (cc or otherwise).as noted above, i already have the money budgeted (plus extra) to cover my student loans, i had been planning to pay them off in march all at once (i know the advice would normally be to just do extra payments monthly, but i was too nervous that something could go wrong and i would need the money, so i just saved it all to pay off in one lump sum instead, then lo and behold, the virus hit and i decided to hold onto it a bit longer rather than pay it off).  since then i have been funneling extra money toward a potential house down payment (and some just-for-fun stuff, i must admit).  i was hoping to maybe buy a house next year, but i am still undecided on that.if i decide to go the cheaper (no truck) route, i could divert the house down payment money + my car repair budget to buy in cash.  if i do decide to get the truck though, i would be okay paying up to $600 monthly(well within what i have leftover each month, as noted above).  i could use my house down payment money + car repair budget either entirely or partially as a down payment to get the payment to that level, but i don't want to pay more than 42k for the vehicle under any circumstances (kind of  arbitrary, i know, but more than that just seems too much).the first and main question is, should i go ahead and put that loan payment budgeted money toward my loan and get it over with?  i like having the security of having that chunk of money around, but i do already have 30k in my emergency fund as well, and i don't believe i would struggle to find another job in my field if my company went under or i got laid off.  i should say though, i was also playing with the idea of diverting that loan payoff money toward a house down payment if a property i really liked came up before i had saved more (i live in an expensive area, looking at 400k-550k for a house that i would consider buying, and i have been watching the market for about a year and have only seen 5 or so houses in my price range that i would be interested in).  but if i did pay off these loans, i could divert the excess 7k to house down payment budget, absorb the car payment, and still have an extra 300-400 to put toward house down payment budget each month, in addition to my usual savings.  i understand that sitting on the money i am ""wasting"" money on paying interest, which has been part of my considerations thusfar, but has not been so compelling of a reason so far for me to give up the security it gives me.i feel like i am stuck trying to make the perfect decision while hedging all my bets, and i just keep going around in circles in my head.  just looking for some opinions here about what is my best bet.some bonus questions:i know it is generally dumb to buy a new car, but the price for **low mileage, relatively recent year, full-size trucks** just seem insane right now, i could get a comparable new car (maybe lower trim) for not much more in most cases it seems.  am i an idiot for even considering a new car?  i have never owned a new car before.i know leasing is also usually a bad idea, but should i consider it to buy me some time before needing to replace my car?  i am willing to compromise on what i want and ""waste"" a little money to buy 3 years of extra savings before buying a truck.  as noted, i drive very little currently (though that is partly because we have been taking my girlfriend's car everywhere since mine isn't super reliable).some anticipated responses and answers:**why not buy an older/higher mileage truck, or buy private party?**  i have done this before, and had terrible experiences time and again, so no, i will not consider this, even if it *supposedly* saves me money.  i want something 100% reliable.**do you really need a truck?**  no, i really don't, but i have wanted one for a long time and have never driven a car that i actually wanted, ever, so i kind of feel like all the hard work i have put into my career should at some point justify being able to buy a vehicle that i want.  my non truck option is tempting, but it's hard for me to justify plopping down 15-20k on something and still not be happy with it...**if you drive so little, why not just go without a car?**  i need a car for a few other reasons, and it must be reliable for long trips.",2,1,Should I pay off my student loans to offset a car payment?,Finance

in a new battery and will still aim to keep this phone (iphone 8+) until it dies.*entertainment -* i spent less here than last year. i tried golfing a few times (pretty expensive) and bought some video games. i also put haircuts in this category even though it probably shouldn't be. i don't spend much in this category. if i need to upgrade my computer or other hardware most of the cases i can pay for it through my business/side hustle and have it as a business expense.*clothing -* this year i set a goal for myself that i would not buy any clothes. i managed to complete this goal, yay!*gym membership -* last year i said, ""this one is a bit on the high end so i need to really evaluate it this year and make sure i go there enough to warrant keeping the expense."" this year was a bit weird so i didn't visit as much as i'd have liked. was able to freeze the membership for end of this year and beginning of the next. we will see when i can establish a normal baseline here again. it was an easier cost to motivate when i was training at an elite level.*health care* \- bought some allergy meds and started seeing a physical therapist to take care of the issue that caused me to retire from sports.*uif -* this is a cheap insurance to make sure i still get 80% of my current income should i lose my job for whatever reason. the cost of this was raised this summer following covid. i might see if i can find another uif at a better price now.*subscriptions -* my spotify account.*transport -* until the beginning of summer i was commuting with busses and trains but for the rest of the year i've been riding my scooter everywhere. thanks to mild temperatures i could ride it throughout december. i had to spend some money getting spare parts to fix up some issues with the moped.*buffer/short term savings -* i dropped this to be at $1000 and have been able to keep it there. i don't know what could possibly happen that would require me to have to deplete all of that amount of money now that i've moved twice and have furniture coming out my ass. in 2021 i will also expand this sort of, by saving for trips and other fun stuff. so there will be a sort of

it's why i even have the emergency fund i do now, and why i have some investments in the market. but i feel like everything may come crashing down and i don't want to make any stupid moves. i renegotiated my rent so i can stay here through next year and the pandemic's hopeful end (god please!!). i have enough between my parent's social security money + the savings i have to forcefully conjure to keep us living here comfortably for another year. i had to renegotiate my rent at a bit of a higher price. of course, the landlords are taking advantage of everything somehow going up in price while people are suffering, but it was about $1k difference and i didn't think it would be worth having to look for a new place. now i am also running into dental issues and think i'll need to use at least $2k to make sure i can keep my teeth longterm. now i'm eating into my own emergency fund, and i know it's an emergency fund, but it's the only cash i have left of my inheritance, about $10k. i don't even know what i'm asking for. i do not want to end up in poverty. i'm a somewhat intelligent person. i have a college degree. i went through hard times and it has thrown me into a dimension where everything is hard. i have to fight against a parent that acts like a child when it comes to budgeting and spending. i am 31 and i want a life. i want a career and to be married someday, but sometimes i feel like i'm raising my mother, and that i am so, so behind and it's so hard to see that this will all be a memory someday and i will have the life i want. can someone please tell me this isn't that bad and there's a way out? i don't know what i'm looking for!

11821,"tl;dr:  how heavily does student debt factor in when a bank determines the interest rate or max amount of a home loan?  is it worthwhile to reduce student debt if it means having a smaller down payment or delaying the home purchase by a year or so?my husband and i (both early/mid-30's) are planning on buying our first house in about 3 years.  he's graduating this spring with $100k in student loan debt, and going straight into a 3-year grad program that will pay around $50-60k per year.  the grad program will not add to his debt.  after that he should hopefully be able to find a job making 6 figures.  i make $80k per year.  we both have clean credit histories.  not counting our emergency fund and retirement accounts, we have about $100k saved up that could be put toward the student loans and/or a future house.so our goal is to buy a house once he's done with his grad program and has a permanent job.  a lot of big details are obviously still up in the air pending his future employment, but i'd like to do whatever we can now to be in a good financial position when that time comes.  my current thinking is that we should throw a big chunk of money (say, $25k) at his student loans this spring.  (rationale:  if we just make the minimum payment on the full $100k balance, it'll basically just cover interest.  but if we reduce the principal right off the bat then with the same monthly payments we could actually make progress on the loans.)  then we spend the next few years of his graduate program saving aggressively for a house. he is more inclined though to keep our full $100k savings invested for now and save aggressively, so that we'll for sure have a healthy down payment + fund for closing costs, immediate house repairs, etc to be able to purchase as soon as he gets a permanent job.  then with his expected higher salary we would focus more on paying down the loans.  he's ok with treading water on the loans until then.are there any good rules of thumb for prioritizing low student debt vs a high down payment?  or is it better still to take an extra year and have both in place before buying?  to what extent would the amount of student debt factor into the bank's decision to lend - will there likely be a difference in interest rates or availability of home loans if we have $100k in debt vs $50k vs $0?",27,1,Better to put extra money toward student loans or a house down payment?,Finance

12395,"backstory, i (with wife) have a home that cost about 268k. bought it a couple of years with a 20% down. so it’s down to $210k. monthly mortgage is about 1k and change. the first couple of years, we’ve been putting extra $1-2k to the principal. just mid of 2020, we’ve started adding extra $1k, which now totals to a consistent $3k to the principal. fast forward, we’re now down to about 170k as of today. with a consistent $3k going to the principal, we’re estimating we’ll be able to payoff in a little over 4 years. that’s our ultimate goal!wife and i basically wanted to pay off our mortgage fast, and be done with it. we have no other loans aside from the mortgage. we’ve also been toying with the idea of getting slightly bigger place, which will probably cost a lot more (perhaps a little over double than this place). so after we payoff our loan, that extra money goes to savings account for a down payment.in addition to the $3k, we have about another 1k (more or less) every month. currently, it’s divided between my kid’s savings and the rest goes to a short term savings which is meant for us to use to do something fun (expensive vacation, buy new expensive tv, etc). we already have our emergency money set aside. some of these cash are sitting on a money market (emergency, child savings) and the short-term is sitting on regular bank.anyways, we’ve been toying with the idea of investing, but we both have very minimal knowledge when it comes to it. so we’ve been hesitant. although just recently, we’ve started talking to a financial advisor and decided we’re gonna put some of our extra 1k to investment, perhaps in a mutual funds. however, it just occurred to me: instead of putting all the extra $3k to the mortgage, what if we put half of it in a short-term investment? this way, part of still goes to the principal and the other half is earning returns. then in 4 years, we could harvest the money from our investment and payoff the mortgage, which still puts on track of our ultimate goal. i’m sure the whatever the returns from that short time won’t be big enough but it’s still something.  my wife, however, is hesitant because she’s scared of the market crashing down within those  4 years, then we would have lost and not be able to pay off our mortgage. thoughts? looking for some real insights, advice.p.s. i should also mention that 15% of our salary goes to our 401k. which we also recently started doing mid of last year. just to put this in the equation just in case.",115,1,"I have extra money, should I payoff mortgage or invest?",Finance

12417,"hey yinz,need some life finance advice. my father passed away a couple years ago and i inherited a small house. after selling it and with some expenses, i'm sitting with about 70k in the bank leftover and have about another 10k in my emergency/misc account. i currently have about 45k remaining in public student loans and am debating whether i should use this money to buy my first house or pay off my students... or both if possible? honestly, i know very little about finances and even less about buying a home. i was raised pretty poor so have any money is relatively new to me. so to give you some context:i'm 29yo, single (and have no plans for kids), and live in pittsburgh. i earn about 80k per year with a fairly stable federal government job. that will probably gradually rise over the next decade, perhaps making around 100k sometime in the next 5-10 years if i do everything right. right now i'm on an ibr student loan plan (i didn't make much right out of college) and about 4 years of payments into the 10 required to get the public student loan forgiveness. however, that will probably be near a wash as my ibr payments continue to increase and i'll likely be close to paying off the loans after a full 10 years anyway, regardless of the public student loan forgiveness program. i have good credit and no other financial burdens (newer car that's also paid off). i'd like to stay in pittsburgh for a while, perhaps even the length of my career. house prices in the neighborhood i'm looking at are currently in the 200-300 range, with 250 appearing to be the common number for comps to what i desire. with the right house, i'd probably be living there for a long, long time. the market in my desired neighborhood will certainly get hotter and pricier with each year.my initial plan was to immediately pay off my student loans and then save over the next few years for a solid 20% down payment on the house i desire. however, i also feel like the 900/mo i'm paying in rent every month feels like a complete waste. so fellow redditors and finance gurus, i need your advice.   do i...  \- stick to my original plan. pay off student loans now, save for probably 3 years or so and buy the house i desire. and if this, should i put my remaining 20-25k in something like an etf? \-buy a house and keep paying student loans (500/mo now and will probably increase to 700/mo in the next few years by my estimates). \-do both? if i pay off my student loans, i'll have 20-25k for a down payment. obviously that's not 20% for 250k, so i'll certainly be feeling higher payments and probably get smacked with pmi. also, it seems there may be at least 10,000 in loan forgiveness looming with the new admin. does this change any of that?   any help is appreciated. thank you.",7,1,Help!

i tried economies accounts (i hope that's what it's called, that account where you send money anytime and you get a monthly interest but you have no restriction on when to get the money out or anything. it's just a simple account that gives you interest). anyway, that account is not exactly great, the interest rate is way way way under the inflation and that's annoying. i also tried the stock market. sent in the market 200 euros, got them to a profit of 500 euros and thought to myself ""hell yeah, soon i'll be a millionaire"", the stock crashed 3 days later and got all the money out with a loss of 50 euros. never touched it again.i also tried index funds. don't exactly know why they didn't worked. i also tried deposits that are fixed for a period of time but it's annoying to lock money in an account for 3+ months. what if an emergency comes up and i need that money? i tried the bag cash in my closet to just keep money there but long term it's not okay. inflation gets me to actually lose money there. i tried everything but i always got to the point where i said ""ah, fuck it, that's  never going to be an option"" and then moved on to spend my economies and get myself into this situation (not a bad situation, i'm not complaining but i know i could've done better for the past 2 years since i doubled my income)another problem coming in. i'm not satisfied with my choice of the car i bought and the entire loan behind it. i bought the car 1.5 years ago and 0.5 years ago i came to the conclusion that i really don't need a \~10k car with a loan behind it. i could've done everything with my old car that had no loan. i found myself with double income and made the common mistake of ""hell yeah, i have money, let's buy a car, don't care anything else"".about this... i'm thinking of something here. i have 24 000 ron (\~5000 euros) left to pay of this car... if i concentrate \~2000 ron each month... i could pay the loan until december 2021 so this year. that would get me to a debt-free 2022 where i can only gain net worth with money in my accounts....or... i could just sell the car, pay off my loan and still leave me with 3000 euros but i'm the kind of guy who needs a car for his travels, groceries etc. i could use those 3000 to buy a car that fits my needs but i'm not sure it's a wise choice because downgrading from a 2015 octavia to a 2008-2010 3k car could lead to extra expenses because the car is well... old. i'm thinking here that the best choice is to fully commit this year to paying of this stupid car and live up with my choices....or... i could just sell the car, pay of 14 000 ron of my 24 000 ron loan and buy a car that would fit my needs with about 5000 euros. that would also mean a downgrade of car's year and comfort but i'll be with a 10 000 ron loan that could be paid much faster and with a cheaper car that could be actually okay with what i need from a car. not exactly sure what would be the best bet here. another thing for my future plans... i really want to get out of renting lifestyle. i want to buy an apartment here in bucharest as soon as i can. i'm thinking of going in for a 60-65 000 euros loan for a 2-bedroom apartment that would lead me to a monthly ""rent"" (to the bank but theoretically to myself) of \~300 eur for a 30 years plan and a down payment of 9900 euros.    so... i think i got into all i can say about my life and financial ""stuff"". i have multiple problems, none that are ""life threatening"", so i want to ""fix"" them. any advice on... anything?

14399,"long story short, my dad (57) bought two annuities at $50k each 4 years ago. after recently getting more involved with his finances, we were getting worried that he didn't have enough retirement savings for him and my mom to retire comfortable (the end goal). we decided that since he's still working and able to work for more years (he works an office job), that it would be best to put the annuity money to better use than sitting in an annuity with very little gains. so now, we have this ""windfall"" and i wanted to make sure we were going about this the right way. below is the plan and a few questions that we had:* the $100k for the annuities came from a cash-out refinance. from my understanding, this doesn't trigger any extra taxes owed since this value is a loan added on top of the original mortgage, correct?* the interest income from the annuities is taxable, but since we're withdrawing in the surrender period, taxes and surrender charge eat up into the principal and he's actually getting only $49,500 on one of them. this also doesn't trigger any tax implications correct?* for the $49,500 sudden ""windfall,"" our plan was to contribute the $14000 maximum for 2020 &amp; 2021 for him and another $14000 maximum for 2020 &amp; 2021 as a spousal ira for my mom (my dad's annual salary is around $95k). since we don't expect any major salary increases and he's much closer to retirement, would a traditional ira (rather than roth) make more sense for him and my mom? i've read through the wiki and this seems to be the way to go, but i just want to make sure i'm not missing anything.* since it's already past january, if he makes a 2020 traditional ira contribution now, is it too late to deduct the $14000 amount from his 2020 taxes? will he have to deduct $28000 from the 2021 taxes? this seems like a huge deduction and i'm worried it might trigger some flags, though i don't know what since this is all legitimate.* the other thing we wanted to do with the money was to refinance and potentially pay some points to minimize the interest rate. te closing costs would be around $11,000 at the maximum. we don't really expect to be moving out of the house any time soon, so it seems like we'll at least break even. the lowest interest rate we've seen is around 2.375% 30yr compared to his 4.75% 30 yr (currently 26yr since he refinanced recently).* the remaining amount would be to pay off credit card debt (which he luckily doesnt have too much of) and beef up the emergency fund.* we're waiting til april to surrender the other $50k since the surrender period for that one ends at that time. we're not really sure what to do with this extra $50k, but likely it will go to the emergency fund again and slowly slip it into his 401k (by maximizing his contributions via payroll and using the $50k to replace the monthly income).is there anything we're missing? any other possible options? one of his concerns is that fafsa may turn down my sister for financial aid (which we do need) if he's keeping too much money in the bank. is there a way to avoid this?thank you!",12,2,"""Windfall"" and IRA contributions",Finance

15604,"i am going to tldr this first bit as it’s still fresh and i don’t feel like going into detail. in mid september my father was killed in an automotive collision, his payout will be ~250k split three ways between our attorney (we think?), my sister and myself. my mother doesn’t need the money, and has expressed that whatever comes back will be split between my sister and myself because ‘that’s what dad would have wanted’ (and i agree).i am less than stellar with money, and i feel like this was maybe the only disappointment my father felt in me, so i’d like to get this right and do what’s best for my future.two years ago my parents bought me a house for ~$112k. a few weeks before his passing, my dad expressed his desire to set up a land contract to sell me the house. my understanding of this arrangement is that it would be incredibly risky for buyer/sellers who didn’t know each other or weren’t family but for us it meant i could pay them whatever dollar amount i wanted (we settled on $500/mo), pick up the taxes and insurance for all in around $700-800/mo. my mother is still in agreement to move forward with this plan.my current plan is to pay off the ~$5k outstanding debts (cc, etc), set aside $5k in an emergency savings account and start having my paychecks start adding to it regularly, and that’s as far as i’ve gotten.my father was the person i’d go to for money questions and i really don’t know what to do from there. besides that, i live with my gf and together we bring in about $5k/mo. we aren’t hurting, we’ve both been able to keep working during the pandemic (luckily), but we aren’t saving a whole lot at the moment, admittedly she’s much better at saving money than i am.i’d like advice on what i should be doing with this money, i feel like i need a plan in place to avoid blowing it all on pointless stuff. as a caveat; there is a potential civil suit as well - we have representation - would the advice given change if that figure was more in the ballpark of a couple hundred thousand and/or millions? idk how money works really, so any advice is welcome. thanks.",7,1,What do I do with an ~$80k+ Insurance payout?,Finance

16038,"hi r/personalfinance! i was hoping i might get some advice from you with regards to my little sister's financial situation. my goal is to help her gain financial stability and i don't mind spending money to do so, but i want to setup a system that will lead to success.my sister is 24 and type ii bipolar and while my mom has supported her a lot it has recently come to light that my mother is financially &amp; emotionally abusive to her. we had a hard home life growing up, but it seems her difficulties are still continuing. i'm a lab scientist at a pharmaceutical company so while i can't fully support her i certainly have the resources to help. i would say i could spend at least $2k over 2021 to support her, maybe even up to $5k. my sister currently lives in a house and pays $600 in rent and works odd jobs including massage therapy (licensed but covid), waiting tables, ski resorts, and white water rafting guide. while she doesn't have a consistent income, she has a skill set broad enough to make a consistent income. the biggest obstacle is still her mental health. i don't think she's capable of working a 40-hour/week job at the moment, but considering her massage background, she could pay all of her bills with just 10 massages/week. she is also going to school part time to get her associates degree and she hopes to go into clinical psychology or social work after that. i'm currently working on reducing some of her monthly expenses (finding cheaper phone plan, and reduced veterinary costs for her dog). she also has a very run down car that will likely need to be replaced soon, an expensive auto insurance plan due to her crazy teenage years, no retirement savings, and health insurance through my mom for the next 1.5 years.due to our home life, i didn't learn to save money until i lived with a man who did. for over a year i was working a $55k/year job without ever having more than $1k in my savings account for more than 3 months. my sister is the same. right now she's got $90 in her bank account but she did just pick up more hours at the ski resort. i would like her to have a savings account that she can access for emergencies, but given her disposition an ""emergency"" could happen at any time and so i don't think me just throwing $2k in an account will do well.i've considered strategies such as: 1:1:1 - she puts 1 into savings, i do 1 in her savings, and 1 in a retirement account (up to a monthly limit). the only issue is i don't want to have control over her savings account (because that's what my mom does), but i still want there to be some accountability for her to keep it in savings. maybe some sort of brokerage account or the other? and is investing in someone's retirement even at all feasible when they need a new car? any advice is greatly appreciated. i'm happy to purchase a financing class if it would help (and do it with her!) or invest in whatever type of account you all think will be best. i want my baby sister to learn financial independence and the beauty of financial security in a methodical and effective way.",6,1,Advice for Helping My Sister as Effectively as Possible,Finance

19066,"i until recently had 13 accounts with flawless history of payment with an average age of 7.5 years.  the reason the account # is so high is because my student loans were structured in such a way that 1 lender considers different semesters different loans.  i have maintained a 5% usage on my 2 credit card accounts which have an average age of 6.  i have 2 credit lines for accounts i needed for an emergency 5 years ago that were paid off immediately but have hung open.  my car payment is my youngest account at 2 yrs and will end at 4.my concern comes with my student loan debt.  my undergrad loans are much smaller but much older at 15 y/o.  my grad loans were large and 12 y/o.  in the past 2 years i have absolutely decimated this debt.  in total there were giving my credit 7 lines.  due to the decimation this is now down to 2 and very quickly can be just 1 and then potentially 0 soon after.although i am very excited, i am also very concerned about my credit score now.  looking at my credit report all my factors were/are the highest they can be giving me a score of 810.  but with the collapse of these older lines, it seems like parts of my credit score (# of lines and age of accounts) will slip into the yellow zone potentially damaging my score.  also, the 2 expensive credit lines i have i anticipate could close at any time due to lack of use.so my plan was to leave my 1 oldest and smallest student loan open as it has an age of 15 years for now (25 year loan).  that will potentially help on the age factor as my credit card lines continue to age up.  however if everything i anticipate happening does, my reporting lines will have dropped from 12 to just 3 and in 2 years, to 2.  this would put me in the red zone for how it affects my credit score.so i'm looking for any advice on what i should do to help mitigate all this shifting around.  i'm very proud of what i've accomplished but it looks like there's some pain to be had and any tips would be very welcome to help me shift into being debt-free and still a good credit bet.  thank you for any assistance.",12,1,Maintaining Credit Score as I Shift Out of Debt,Finance

19178,"hi all - i'm looking for some advice on if my wife and i are in the right spot to afford to build a new home. i could use some extra eyes to see if our finances are ok and i'm not missing anything. we are thinking of building a home that all in after land, build, etc would be 515k. property tax is nys so we'd be around 11-13k yearly. we plan to put either 5-10% down. we'd be selling our existing home . 5% down would be around 3450-3500 mortgage, 10% down would be 3100-3300.for the record, we rushed into buying a home 2 years ago as my starter home sold, and a house i had an offer accepted on didn't disclose that they were in foreclosure. so i had 1 week to find a property to ensure i had a place to live before my old house closed. so we don't like this home, it needs a lot of tlc and isn't our style (1960's split level).current situation:my gross salary: 170k - annual 35% bonus which is about 59500 pre-tax (march of every year). wife makes 48k gross.current expenses: (car payment, student loan payments is pretty much all we have debt wise) comes to about 1200 a month (627 car note, $91 interest free mattress payment and 450 in student loan). our current mortgage is a 30 year at 4.375% and a 1,870/mthly payment (28 years left). we have about 65k in equity, about 30-35k that we'd net when we sell, after commission, fees, tax, etc. that's on the conservative end and in this market could go for much more - 237,000 loan, house is valued between 300,000-315,000.we have about 50k in savings.i have my annual bonus coming up which i never plan on, but the number above give or take is what it will be.after all bills/expenses monthly we have about 5-6k left over at the current moment.plan right now is that wife continues to pay off her student debt with her take home (about 2600 monthly). i handle the bills, expenses outside of that and still have about 4k left over. my car note is only 0.9% interest and 4 years remain, so not sure it's worthwhile to take action on that.we would either put down 5% of 515k (plus closing costs). or do a bridge loan until sale of the home and put down 10% and pay off bridge quickly with proceeds from sale. between bonus, current savings, and mortgage we should have 50-60k left over with 10% down for emergency fund.i've ran the numbers 800 different ways 50/30/20, 28% mortgage, etc. i'm very nervous since this is a large purchase, but we should have on my pay alone about 3000 monthly after all bills, fixed and variable expenses with the new build. the 50/30/20 model puts me alone around 57%/10%/30% (we don't have many variable expenses) with the new home.can anyone provide any insight or advice? we could stay put, this house does need more work and probably won't ever be what we want - so if we stay it would be for 1-3 years to continue to save and then move. with covid and the market, i feel like building has caught up to existing housing. i'm just very nervous and from a middle class family that earned 50k income growing up. is this the right move?any advice is appreciated!",2,1,"To build new home or stay put, can I afford it?",Finance

19974,"reason for doing this: this will be sorta keeping tabs on my milestones (which i setup arbitrarily) and maybe inspire someone out there who started from 0, that there is hope of one day making it big.i'm not going to go into too much detail about my personal life (don't want to stalker). but, just so you have some general idea about me: male, in my late 20s, student with a part-time job, no debt, no other asset (i will be updating this as well in my concurrent posts down the line).current ""short-term"" end goal: $100k cdnlong-term goal: based on my own perspective, to have enough money to not have to worry about money while living a comfortable lifestyle. to me, this means traveling comfortably (business class flights), helping out close-family and friends, specially my parents (i want them to have the best life), and the general (buy a nice house, 1/2 rental units, maybe even start a business, yada yada (the opportunities are endless)...you get the idea.so, i've reached my first milestone (10k cdn, didn't put in the title cause that looks very not-dramatic lol), yay!! it took sometime, but i'm here. when i first started, it felt like it would happen much later. but weirdly, once i started saving and investing, i found all these avenues i could save money in and put it in the market. so, i did that.things i learned along the way:1. fuck everyone else! seriously tho, i see so many people buying shit they don't need and asking me to go on shopping trips with them on boxing day/black friday. i'm like, no! and they buy all the nice shit, and are quick to jump on sales and ""saving so much money"" on the apple ipad, airpods, jackets, and shoes they don't need. also, this branches into other big ticket items. i wish i could tell so many people, ""no, you don't need that $1000 phone. doesn't matter if it's $700 now. that's not saving money, you're losing $700.""2. this is more related to investing. i lost a lot of money, the last time i got into investing (or i should say currency trading/swing trading). i lost a lot of money because i was trying to time the market, and i got emotional and sabotaged myself. this time, i'm in for the long haul. see ya in 30 years, lol!3. treat yourself along the way. i realized i love to cook, or have dinners with friends/family. so, that's what i spend my money on. once a month or once every two months, i try to arrange a dinner with my loved ones, and have fun! so, i generally let myself spend money in this avenue as i'm pretty strict on other stuff.4. two bank accounts. one i use regularly, the other just for saving. i've noticed, if i see money sitting in my checking account (on the one i use for everything), i feel okay spending money on stuff i wouldn't buy otherwise (like going to mcd, cause i have money). however, when i usually keep like 5/10 bucks in the checking account, i tend to keep away from spending money on unnecessary shit.5. this sorta relates to no 4. when i receive some extra money (whether through holiday bonus or something similar), i deposit it into my tfsa. i might just keep it as cash for a while (until it snowballs into a big amount to buy into an equity). just doing this has kept me from not spending that bonus amount. putting something in a tfsa makes me think that it's untouchable. i know i'm not gonna take anything out until i've got an emergency.6. slow and steady. even if you have only $50 to put away, don't think that's a small amount (cause it's not). 10 of those, and you have $500. even though it might feel like you're not getting ahead, i promise you will start seeing the numbers go into 4 digits soon. and don't compare yourself to others. if you see someone celebrating their 1 million/10 millions milestone, remember that they also started from where you have. or maybe their parents did, then hope that one day you can pass 1 million or more to your child (so that they can be in a similar position).that's pretty much all i have for now. also, don't take my advice completely, use your own judgement and utilize it in your own situation. we all have different lives and maybe you know something i don't. in which case, feel free to leave your note in the comments, so that i can learn from you.thank you for reading this far down! cheers! and happy almost new year :)",1,1,0 to $10k (What I Learned),Finance

20656,"some background: my husband got a huge promotion in 2020, and together we ended up making almost four times what we had been earning in years before. gross income was around $400,000. we have our taxes all figured out with a good accountant, so we have been paying estimates and should be all set there. we have a very detailed budget (thanks to starting ynab a year ago), with an emergency fund to cover six months expenses, and lots of other cash marked for dealing with other predictable future expenses. we are both around 40. we have zero debt.retirement: in the past, we haven’t had much extra to put into retirement funds. we each have small roth iras (only about $5000 in each) from before his income went above the limit. he is partly on salary, with benefits, and partly self-employed in his position. his employer matches 3% of his salary (which is only $48,000, the rest comes from self-employment) into his simple sep, which now has a balance of $17,000 from the past few years of being employed there. we have made contributions to take full advantage of the match, but we are otherwise way behind on funding our retirement. we only contributed $1700ish in 2020 to the employer retirement plan, pretty much just enough to get the full match. we did not know how amazing this year would be for him, because of pandemic-related changes to the business. this year we will be setting up retirement accounts for each of us through my husband's corporation, where i am a 5% owner and on payroll for my administrative duties, so i know that will be good for building up our retirement savings even more. but i'm wondering if there is anything we can do now to make any retirement contributions for 2020 (i know i should have dealt with this sooner). i've read about backdoor ira contributions and i don't completely understand but maybe that would be a good option for us? we have $45,000 sitting in our ""new house fund"" that we could use some of for a big ira contribution if that would make more sense. that brings me to my next question…housing: we currently live in a rental house in a hcol area, a suburb of a really expensive city. my husband already has a big commute to work so i don't want to move any farther away. our rent is $2500 now, for a tiny 4br house for us and our 3 kids. we like our house but there are a few issues, the biggest being that we all share one bathroom, and that is tough sometimes with our kids becoming teens. our lease is up soon and we will have the option to renew. we have never been in a position to buy a house before, and i do want to make sure we proceed carefully and are fully prepared for such a big decision. to get a house in our current city with 4 brs and at least 1.5 baths, it would cost around $700,000. i worked with a mortgage broker in december to see what was possible, and we got pre-approved for a $600,000 mortgage, also would wait a few more months until we have $100k or more for down payment. i know that i would need to plan for bigger monthly expenses, including taxes and home maintenance if we do buy a house. i have done a lot of research on this part.so here's where the maybe unusual employment situation comes in. my husband’s income accounts for 90% of our total, as i only work part-time. he has just secured a three-year contract, which is a big deal for us because one-year contracts are common in his industry. his job is physically demanding, and disability insurance is not possible due to the nature of his work (i have looked into it). it is written into his contract that if he becomes unable to do his job for 60 days, he will lose the position. this fact already concerned me, and as i sit here typing this out, i realize that i should be concerned and probably we should continue to rent and keep our expenses low, and save as much as we can while we can. am i thinking about this the right way? it’s so tempting to look around at the houses we can technically “afford” right now. and so enticing to think about owning our own place.thanks for reading!

my wife started a business last year that has very low overhead which netted \~15k in profit in 2020. i haven’t accounted for any of that in the calculations above but based on projections she should beat that number this year.10. the 150k deposit money just sitting in cash not earning anything is also giving me anxiety as i feel like im leaving money on the table. i need to put it to work. if i don’t end up buying the house i would put it into the market but if there is a crash it would derail my house buying plans for a while.11. rates in the 2-3% range can change and then i can afford less so i feel pressure to act fast like time is running out. i hate making decisions from a place of fear.12. some people might say you can buy houses below 600k if im willing to move into the inland empire. although true, i think it’s not a good hedge if i need to look for other opportunities (work in tech). so i need to be reasonably close to hubs (&lt;40min) like la proper, irvine etc. writing this out has been a helpful exercise in itself. but i would appreciate any feedback. i really need some perspective esp. from others who live in hcol areas like i do with similar circumstances to me. it’s scary putting this much money down in one go and then choosing higher housing payments esp in a all-time high housing market.thanks",62,2,Early 30s single-income w/ wife and kid looking to buy housing in HCOL (SoCal).

23448," i (22m) purchased a 2010 truck after high school for $23,500 cdn. as of now i owe $3600, which i could pay off anytime. as of right now i think i could get between $15000-$18000 for it. the market on trucks of a similar model and package but with higher kilometres seem to stay around $10000 and not go much lower. therefore, if i was to keep it i can expect $10000 and whatever might go wrong in between. if i were to sell it i’d get an older car like a honda civic in the $3k-$4k range. i’ve recently discovered the power of index funds and compounding interest. i’ve also realized that i haven’t used the truck for anything i bought a truck for. i wanted boats, quads, etc but that is no longer an interest of mine so the only thing it’s convenient for is winter. my question for you guys, although it is mostly personal preference, is if it’s worth it to pay it off and sell it now for a maximum of $8500 loss, or keep and and sell it for $10000 down the road and risk the potential repair costs of owning a truck that can just come out of nowhere. if i sell it i would put the money towards my down payment goal, and invest the rest as i already have a 10 month emergency fund. tldr: bought a truck for $23500 just over 3 years ago. could sell it tomorrow for at least $15k(8500 loss), or keep it and sell it for $10000 in a few years with unpredictable repairs in between. would use extra cash for buying cheap car, down payment goal, and investing.",5,1,Pay off and Sell Truck to Invest?,Finance

23804,"hi all. i'm looking for some advice on whether or not you'd consider pursuing a masters in computer science if you were in my shoes.i've got a b.s in mechanical engineering and currently work as a software engineer for a f500. they'll pay $7500/year towards a masters. i'm two years into my career and make around $73k (decent for my area when you include the benefits). fiance makes around $80k and is around $5k in-debt. i'm 26, she's 25. we currently rent. we're able to save around $1400ish a month, after rent and bills and life expenses.i was thinking about taking it easy with the degree and doing three courses a year. if i were to do that, the degree would take me around three years to complete and would cost me $3300 out-of-pocket per year. my employer would cover the remainder.my motivation for getting the degree is as follows:* i want to nail down some of the harder-to-self-teach parts of my field (ex. cybersecurity, db design) so i could build cooler shit. i'm trying to self-teach some of this stuff now, and going for a masters would align with many of my self-education goals.* i want to be an engineer with a masters degree in their field. it would be something i'd be really, really proud of accomplishing.* it's a good career move, [as a masters in comp sci is fairly lucrative](https://www.mastersprogramsguide.com/highest-paying-masters/#masterssalary7), and i would have to make around an extra $1k/year for each of the years after finishing the degree for it to pay off.* i have a window between \~26 and \~29 years old to pursue a masters without it interfering with any parenting plans. beyond that, parenting plans could get in the way.* getting a corporate sponsorship in my mid-twenties is probably the best financial opportunity i have to get the masters before i'm in my 40s, so if i'm going to get it, i should really get it now.* i'd have five-six years of work experience when i'd get my masters, which feels like really, really good career timing.* we make $150k a year gross and can save 1.5k/month -- this is affordable even without any col cuts.there are some issues with this plan from a financial and personal perspective.1. i've got 43k private debt at %11apr, $10k credit card debt at 20% apr, and 34k debt at 6% apr , and the former two are enough of a wild gigantic emergency for me to forego all unnecessary expenses, including this one2. the $$$ that goes towards the degree would lower the growth of my fiance and i's housing fund (as i would be contributing far less).3. software engineering is a field where masters degrees are mostly optional. i can have a six-figure income and job security without getting a graduate degree.4. the time spent on the degree is time i could be spending getting up-to-speed on more relevant tech.5. i can likely self-teach the bulk of the course material at a slower pace (six years instead of three) and have the freedom to ignore any useless academic nonsense.6. i would likely be locked into my current employer for the next three-five years, assuming i started it today. need to verify this, though. additionally, if i was fired, i would be unable to continue the degree until i received more corporate sponsorship7. 3 years of constant coursework will be a bit of an emotional gauntlet. my engineering degree took a lot out of me, and the prospect of balancing school and work again is a bit daunting8. i am horrible at schoolwork, so it's entirely possible that i would get two years into the degree and lose my nerve, making the investment a bit riskya potential workaround would be to lower the course load from three courses to two. this would make the degree completely free, and would give some time over the summer to chill out from coursework, but it would extend the length of the degree from three to five years, increasing the likelihood of it going unfinished due to personal limitations, job issues, planning parenthood, and/or other life events.my fiance is really on-the-fence with it due to how my existing debt already impacts her/our financial outlook. we haven't really hashed it out much yet, as i'm still not certain that i should go for it or not.my perspective is that it's taking advantage of a limited window for me to get a masters, as corporate sponsorship is really the only way i'll be able to afford a masters before my hair starts to go. this sponsorship isn't guaranteed throughout the course of my career, so if i wait another three years for us to be in better financial shape, i really risk never being able to afford the masters at all. additionally, the income and career flexibility reaped from a 10k comp-sci masters will make up for the cost of getting the degree and the opportunity cost of not paying off loans.anyways, let me know if y'all have thoughts. i think i'm totally delusional and have the blinders on a bit, but there's enough truth to the positives for me to be a bonehead with it.",10,1,"~85K in debt, wondering if I should go for a M.S. in Compsci for 10k",Finance

24701,"this is really hard to put in a title, so i'm going to try to explain it here. also, i am resubmitting this post to meet sub rules on mentioning... current events. **tl;dr at bottom.****context:**i was born in canada, and while my mom is fully canadian, my dad is fully american. my dad registered me as a us citizen born abroad a few months after i was born, but never really explained it to my mom. when i was 2 years old, my mom and i moved to texas to be with my dad. things only lasted a few months, however, and i came back to canada with my mom. i have never lived in the us since then, and have never worked in the us. however, at some point, i got a us ssn in my name. this might have happened when i was a newborn, when i was registered as a us citizen born abroad. but regardless, i didn't know at the time and neither did my mom. my mom never saw the papers, and while i wound up getting photocopies a few years ago, i didn't really realize what situation i was in. over the years, a lot of stuff happened that was never fully explained to me. either that, or the laws changed sometime in the last 10 years.over the years my family in the usa would talk about my citizenship from time to time when i went to visit them, and told me about all the cool stuff i was eligible for. free passage between both countries, a us passport that i could get, the ability to live and work in both countries, and so on. my aunt, who worked for the irs, actually went and set me up with... some ""things"" that automod does not like me saying, but i am apparently the beneficiary for some ""things"". you can likely guess what they are. i don't think it's worth too much, but they exist and my aunt pulled them up on the computer when i was a kid and showed me that they would be mine one day. i don't think i'm legally responsible for them right now. but to make a long story short, my family also told me that i would not have to pay taxes on anything unless/until i ""claimed"" the benefits of my citizenship by doing something ""active"". like moving or working in the us, voting, or claiming my ""things"" from my aunt. and my aunt worked for the irs, so this seemed like solid info. but this was over 10 years ago.anyway, after many years and getting a canadian passport - but not being able to claim dual citizenship because my mom and i didn't have the papers - my dad gave me this stack of photocopies. i think i was about 18. the front page was a document showing that i'm a us citizen born abroad, and it was dated to when i was a newborn. then, a bunch of pages of legal-ese looking papers followed, that i stupidly ignored. i tucked them away in my room. my ssn was on the back page and i just found it yesterday.**situation:**so flash forward to this week, i am 24 years old. due to current events in the financial world, i decided that i wanted to set aside a small, fixed budget and open an account related to these events (which automod does not like me mentioning.) however, when i go to sign up, i see a warning asking me if i have any claims to us citizenship in any way, or any possible chance i could be within ""us tax residency"". this sends me down a rabbit hole. i decided to pull out my photocopies from my dad, since this account said that i was legally obligated to disclose my us ssn if i had one. sure enough, i found a photocopy of my ssn on the back page of this stack, and it's definitely mine. i decided to go research why this canadian account is asking me to claim a us ssn to open a canadian account... i thought that since i've never lived or worked in the us, i didn't have to do anything with it. after all, my aunt who worked for the irs told me as a child that i was fine unless if i decided to move or work in the us and basically ""activate"" it. so i vaguely knew already that i had a ssn, but it never crossed my mind that often because i thought i hadn't ""activated"" it yet by ""using"" my us citizenship.anyway, to make a long story short, i think i might be in trouble. i've been faithfully filing my taxes yearly to the cra (canada revenue agency) ever since i turned 18, with no problems at all. but i've never filed anything with the irs. i've never done anything to ""use"" my citizenship like vote, open a us account, buy major property (unless if those ""things"" my aunt got me used this ssn without me knowing), or received any benefits like social supports. also, here in canada, i wouldn't call myself wealthy. i have an emergency fund and enough money to pay the bills and my student loan. but i'm very frugal, live with family, and use public transport. i'm just a few months away from paying off my student loan. i work almost full time (was full time pre-covid) in food service, and earn a few dollars above minimum wage. other than my chequing and savings accounts, the only ""special"" things i have are my student loan and a credit card that i faithfully pay off every month. when i do my tax returns, i always got refunds, and have never owed taxes that i had to pay. we'll see about this year because i'm out of school right now and working.so... this is where i'm at right now. i've never filed a thing with the irs, since i've never lived or worked in the us in my entire conscious life. but i think i might be in trouble now. my us family always told me i didn't have to file unless i ""used"" my citizenship, but now i'm not so sure. tonight i'm going to reach out to my dad and my aunt and see if they know anything. i need to ask my dad if he has the original documents (because the ones i have are bad photocopies and some stuff is cut off), and i need to ask my aunt who worked for the irs if she knows what i'm supposed to do. that, and the ""things"". so... my question is on what i'm supposed to do now. am i in a lot of trouble or do i just need to file what i missed? should i brace for fines? i'm reaching out to family but i'm really lost on what my next steps are. if any. however, i do want to get this sorted out, one way or another.**tl;dr: i'm a canadian/us dual citizen, who lives and works in canada only. my dad registered me for a ssn when i was born, as an american citizen born ""abroad"", but i only lived in the us for a few months as a baby. i have full dual citizenship to both countries and have not revoked either one. i'm 24 now, and have never filed us taxes with the irs, because i thought i only had to file canadian taxes. am i in trouble? what now?**",111,1,"(CAN / USA) I'm a Canadian / US dual citizen from birth, but have never lived or worked in the US.

27454,"i have some question for those who are more ""in the know"" about medical bills. i've read a ton of other similar posts, but mine is a little different so not quite sure what to do. please bear with me as i try to explain.  my husband's health insurance (through his job) is complete crap. we didn't realize it until he broke his finger in november.... but it's crap. because we're young and dumb, we had decided to go with a high deductible plan. we had figured that, because he had/has no health issues, we'd only be on the hook for a true emergency, and this would save us money in the long run. we now realize that a high deductible plan is probably better for a serious accident like a car accident but not so great for a mid-level accident like a broken finger. live and learn. but here's the part that gets weird...  before his scheduled surgery, he had called the doctor, hospital and anesthesiologist group to make sure he/we knew what we'd be paying. the problem was with the anesthesiologist group, who quoted $100-200 over the phone. low price was because it would be very short surgery. he didn't record this phone conversation, and wish that he had. you can probably see where i'm going with this...&amp;#x200b;we got a bill from them a couple weeks ago for essentially $650. the original price billed to the insurance was $1000, which they didn't pay despite being in-network (which apparently is because of our high deductible plan?) this said, our insurance meant that we were able to pay the ""special price"" of $650 rather than $1,000. this is for literally 3 minutes of anesthesia (!) (!) (!)  so our frustrations are twofold:  1) we were quoted a very different price beforehand so that we could get our finances in order. the price of the surgery itself was fairly expensive ($1,900) so we budgeted everything for that. despite lots of phone calls to the anesthesia center, they won't budge. is it legal for them to do this?  2) does this price even sound correct for three minutes of anesthesia? i know it's expensive but it was literally three minutes.   any advice? this may just be a live and learn situation, but my frustration is fueled by feeling like we got screwed over. not helped by the fact that apparently the billing agent at the anesthesia center  (apparently also the manager) is incredibly rude, as my husband has told me. he even tried to get her to pause the bill (not send it to collections) while we talked to the insurance company, as we weren't originally sure if this was an insurance issue and she refused. so we can't even try to dispute the bill through insurance because it may go to collections. not sure if that's legal or not.  this is in texas, by the way. any help appreciated. because of our current financial situation, it's do-able but difficult to pay this bill.",10,1,Medical billing frustrations,Finance

29429,"i'm a very new adult (m23) on my own with my finances for the first time and have two options to attack my 2400 balance on a credit card.due to not being able to work last year (i work in entertainment) and having to use my credit card more for things, my balance grew and i'm trying to get in under control. thankfully, i found a job doing some contract work, but unfortunately, my current salary really only covers my rent+bills with only about 100 dollars left over for food and anything else. i've also had to considerably drain my savings and am down to about 1800 to my name in savings accounts. it's tight, but manageable for the time being. but that means i don't have cash left over for credit card payments.my credit card company has told me i qualify for a ""short term financial relief program"" that offers up to 12 months of assistance. here's what the company representative told me about the program:&gt;the apr on any pay over time balance or on balances on cards with a credit limit will be a maximum of 5.99% for 12 months.  your total monthly payments will be $42.00. you can always pay more. enrollment will require first payment of $42.00 to be made today.  while you are enrolled, we will not charge you late payment fees and annual membership fees (if applicable).  if you have a credit card, your limit will be reduced, unless you’re over your limit.  a monthly spending limit will be applied on charge cards and adjusted periodically while you’re in the program.  you can generally spend up to the amount of your monthly payment unless the balance is near, at, or over your limit.  reductions in your credit limits on personal credit card accounts, may have an impact on your credit bureau score.  prescheduled automatic payments are required for program enrollments.  if your accounts are current, you will be able to spend, within a limit.  if you’re being reported to the credit bureaus and make your payments on time, your account will continue to be reported as current if it's current now. or if it's past due now, it will not be reported as further past due.  interest will be billed base on the balance at 5.99% apr.now, correct me if i'm wrong, this sounds like a high interest rate, so will i end up paying more money in the long run? and to be honest, i don't see how 42 dollars a month gets me to 2400 in 12 months. i'm bad at math, but not that bad... does the payment plan, if i make higher than $42 payments a month boost my credit score?option number two i have is using my tax refund and stimulus payments. i am getting my 1800 dollar stimulus payments with my tax return as i didn't receive them with everyone else due to a name change issue. according to turbotax, i should be receiving $2640 from the irs.**now my question for reddit is: is there any benefit in doing a payment plan and putting my return into my savings/small safe investments in case of emergency? or should i rid myself entirely of my credit card debt in one go? any advice at all is greatly appreciated.**",5,1,Credit Card Payment Plan VS Big Payoff from Fed.

1564,"a little past 11 last night i woke up to really heavy pounding on my door, then heard the door quietly open about 30 seconds later. i heard someone inside, then heard a couple normal knocks after that, then it was silent for 10 minutes. keep in mind i haven't seen or heard my roommate here for over 2 weeks, and we didn't exchange numbers because i've only briefly spoke to her and moved in last month. i was mainly concerned because the roommate would not obnoxiously bang on the door and then use her key to open it, and i didn't hear any keys. i google if i should call the police because i'm not totally believing there's an actual bad guy inside, and if so, why *my* place, these apartments are very safe but technically the ""ghetto"" is less than a mile away. i ended up calling the nonemergency number for a nearby town because the nonemergency for my own town was a 1800 number and for some reason i felt weird about calling that. i tell the guy what happened, and i'm like it's possibly my roommate, like i repeated that a few times, because i didn't want to make this a big deal and was hoping they would just sent an officer for a quick check or something. he transferred me to the 911 in my city, and i told her the same thing, i'm not sure if someone is in my apartment or if it's my roommate. the reason i didnt go check is because i'm not going to jeopardize my safety in case it seriously was a killer. about 5 minutes later my roommate opens the door to the police, so i was relieved that she was here, but they sent over 20 officers and they were all crowded in the hallway and in the doorway staring at us and i'm still kind of confused about the heavy knocking because my roommate was like ""no i also heard that and i wasn't sure what was going on and asked my friend to check on me"" so the officers were like rolling their eyes at us and were probably like damn what a waste of our time, and i felt bad but i told the dispatcher like 5 times i'm not totally sure and said *i don't want to make this a big deal* and it's not my fault she sent like half of the police dept. but wait, there's more!a couple minutes after they left, 2 security patrol ladies talked with us, they are the designated patrol officers for my apartment, and here's what happened:a pizza guy was trying to find someone with the same name as my roommate and was knocking on the wrong door. he told security he needs to just get this pizza delivered and go to his next place. security woman is like oh yeah buddy i will sure help you, by fucking trying to knock our door off the hinges by banging on it. so she was the loud door pounder. i essentially called the police on the police. i also had no idea we had security. i also think the door opening sound was my roommate opening her bedroom door to see the knocker. i was super embarrassed, but i made sure to get my roommate's number so that if i ever hear any shady things going on at night i can just text her and be like hey is that you",5,29,open this if you wanna hear about how I thought someone was breaking into my apartment [long],Adult

3458,"so even though you guys don't know me i thought i should post something good that happened to me. so at the beginning of this year my finances were in a mess after my parents pulled the plug on my support i used me credit cards (largely empty at the time) to finance the gap as i scrambled to get a job. this ended up taking 5 months as the first half was me basically seeing if there was anyway for me to get a job (part time) and stay in school but eventually after nothing i decided to declare a financial emergency and crash out of university to fix the situation. there is a long complicated reason for why my parents acted they way they did and i understand why (though i am still salty about it, in the end its their money and they can decide how to spend i). i have moved onanyway after crashing out of school being unemployed for a while and find ever more creative ways to cut food to make sure the stores i had could last months rather than weeks (i operated on a rent only policy) {though truth be told i probably spent more when i was broke on food than when i am making money}. february things looked bleak, i had finally ran out of credit my parents had agreed to reverse their decision to help but not bail me out and i finally got a job but was shortly their after fired for not being the right fit and i was beginning to be behind on my rent payments. i did (thank god) land a second job so my contingency plan of going on welfare and crashing out of a lease i couldn't afford could wait. i worked solid 40 hour weeks and as the cash rolled in i was able to stabilize the situation. i then faced a choice do i balance all my expenses and just pay down my debt gradually? or do i pay somethings faster than others to shorten the overall period in which i pay everything? i eventually did a bit of both i decided to pay off as much of my lease as i could and maintaining my balance (maxed out) in august i finally paid my lease some 4 months ahead of me and i decided to stop paying rent and start tackling my debt mountain. today, even after i finally rescinded my financial emergency declaration and spending is returning back to a new normal (roughly 35-45% ish of my income) i am pleased to announce to the world that my assets vs. debts is nearing the black again (notwithstanding student loans of course) and i am really happy!! i am going to pay off the remainder of my lease and then finish the fight and get my balance back to zero by end of january. i can see the light at the end of the tunnel and i just have to say to past me (even though he can't hear me) it does get better in timetl:dr close to completely paying off all my credit card debt!!!",2,1,Finances (I am almost in the black again!),Adult
