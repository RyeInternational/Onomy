116,"earlier this week my car was backed into. there was some serious damage done, it needs a new hood, bumper, headlights, (possibly the radiator ever though its actually running fine at the moment) and there is probably some frame damage (my car is a honda civic, his is a ford f550 dump truck :/) my car was off and in park, i was no where near the vehicle and the other driver and are i both in agreeance that they are at fault. we exchanged all of the applicable information with each other. yesterday he called his insurer to open a claim and told me that an adjuster would be calling me soon. all of this is seemingly going smoothly but here's what i'm worried about and i'm hoping that y'all can either put this fear to rest or help me find a way to best handle this situation.my car is a 2001 honda civic lx, i bought it in october of 2018, it only had 44k miles on it and was basically mint condition until a couple of days ago, it was like driving a new car. the kelly blue book value of my vehicle is below $4,000. i have yet to take the car to a body shop yet for a quote but i assume that the total cost of the repairs will exceed that of the vehicle, however it still runs just fine. what i'm worried about is that his insurance will tell me its totaled and only give me a check for what they assess the vehicle to be worth which won't be nearly enough to pay for the repairs on this car or replacing it with a car of equal value.can they do this legally? what is their obligation to me if anything? what should i be expecting to get out of this?&amp;#x200b;",4,14,I Don't Know How Car Insurance Works,Adult

62,"i let a friend stay with me while his divorce went through. one night after a few beers i found out that he was bi-sexual. my longest fantasy finally came true.i got a divorce about a year ago and have been by myself ever since.  every night i sit and watch tv then take matters into my own hands.  thinking about every fantasy i have ever had.  my hand never talks back and never denies me the pleasure i seek.    at the store one night, i saw an old friend of mine doing a little shopping.  james was the friend that i worked with for about three years at my last job.  we began to talk and share stories of old times.  during our conversation, i found out he had been staying at a local hotel.  that he was getting a divorce from his wife of eight years.    i offered to let him stay with me until he got back on his feet.  james is about six foot tall and has an athletic build.  he took me up on my offer and took over my spare bedroom.  a few nights later he wanted to use my laptop to check his e-mails.    i do a lot of writing on my laptop things like stories and even my fantasies.  i had forgotten that i had left one of my fantasies open when he got on the laptop.  a couple nights later we were drinking a couple beers and talking.     james brought up the fantasy that he had read a couple nights earlier.  it was the one that i had jacked off about many times.  in my fantasy, i was on my knees giving a friend a blowjob and then later he took my virgin ass.     i know that i turn red in the face as he was talking about it.  i could not deny it though.  i explained that i have never acted on it but it was a fantasy of mine.  we left it that way and i went to bed.   an hour later i heard a knock on my bedroom door.     ""hey bro you asleep?""   ""no what's up?""    ""i was thinking about your fantasy want to make a reality?""     ""no, man it was just a fantasy.""james placed a hand on my leg and began to rub.  he nudged me over onto my stomach and began to give me a back rub.     after a few minutes, i found myself getting really turned on. i rolled back over to my back and he stood up and removed his pants and shirt.  his cock was standing straight out it had to be aleast ten inches and very thick.    i found myself rubbing my own cock as i watched him strock his.  for some reason i raised up and took him into my hand and began to suck it.  the tast of his pre=cum was warm and salty.  james placed his hand on the back of my head and started thrusting in and out of my mouth.   it wasn't long before he was shooting his warm load down my throat.  the tast was strange but good in a diffrent way.  he climbed on the bed and and sucked me off like i never had before.  we laid there for about another hour.    james whispered in my ear.   ""i want to cum in your ass.""    i reached back and felt that he was hard again.    ""please be easy.""    james grabbed the lube beside the bed and lubed himself up.  he rolled me to my stomach and raised my ass.  i felt his thick head press against my small opening.  as he started to  inter me the pain was strong i did not know whether i could take it or not.  then it popped in i let out a loud moan.    james sat there for a few minutes to let me relax.  as my hole began to relax and take his thick shaft jame started to thrust little be little.  after a few minutes james grabbed my hips and thrusted deep the pain turned to pleasure.    the head of his huge cock was rubbing against my p-spot and i started to moan.  with in a few more strocked he let out grunt and filled my ass with his load.  god i never felt so sood after sex.",2,1,It just happened,Adult

555,"so i recently (finally) bought my own place (35f). a tiny condo surrounded by other condos. to make more space i built a loft. 95% of the building process i did on the other side of town in my gf’s garage but the assembly and install meant a lot of pounding noises and drill noises for 1.5 hours after work during the week (6-ish-8pm).  during that time a person in the next porch over who appeared to be a teenager asked me if  i would stop the noises because they “had to work in the morning.” i explained it would all be over by 8 pm but that i really needed to assemble it right now so i’d have a bed, which is actually true.  my girlfriend and i are polyamorous and i can’t sleep at her house every night even though i have been sleeping at her house many nights while trying to build this loft. it took us a good two weeks to build it. this was basically the last hour and a half of work before i had my own bed back. the quiet time hours in our condominium hoa are 10 pm to 7 am, so i was not doing anything wrong per say.   well speaking to this person they said something i couldn’t understand and i asked them to repeat themselves but instead they just got mad and went inside slamming the door.   after that we continued to build the loft and were done at 8 pm as promised. but all the while we were building it that person made banging sounds on the other side of the wall every time we had to pound the boards in place and drill in the screws. it was like they were responding to our banging with more banging, at times i could hear them yelling curse words behind the wall too. it really stressed me out at the time, because i could feel the hatred from this person at me for making the noise.  my other neighbors are really great so far. i think this person is autistic because i was told one of my neighbors is autistic and that person certainly acted very oddly to me that night.  anyway, i know i stressed this person out as well as stressed out myself. and in general i want to be good with all my neighbors, so how should i apologize to this person? i don’t really feel like i owe them an apology but at the moment i feel afraid of them. i went out to my scooter the other day and found a very sharp pair of scissors sitting on the seat. i don’t know if that was them. but i want my living situation to feel safe again.    should i just make them some cookies and write a note saying it won’t happen again? what is truly the adult thing to do here?",8,6,How do I apologize to my Austin neighbor who I disturbed with loud noises when I was building my loft bed?,Adult

1815,"if university is elementary school,grad school is middle school,andphd is high school,then i'm back to constantly wishing i was in high school again. 'high schoolers' seem to be able to do whatever they want and have more independence, get to travel more, get to study in their field of choice and do real-world stuff and research, go to awesome conferences and learn important interesting stuff and eat good quality food, not shitty dining common food, and seem to be socially allowed to feel confident and secure with themselves (or as secure as a human can get).i can't wait til i'm in high school!(ok but fr, i know the whole college-masters-phd system is messed up rn and there're so many issues, don't even get me started on the crippling debt, but just ignore all that, suspend your disbelief, and pretend you're a kid when you're reading that)but seriously, about that last part, i'm going to go on a tangent. although college life has been ok so far, i don't think i'll ever fully be satisfied with where i am in life. right now, i'm pretty secure about who i am and what i want to do, as well as what makes me comfortable, my beliefs, and my personal standards for myself and others. but for some reason i feel pressured to feel insecure about everything. i feel like i should care more about how others perceive and judge me, although i truly don't care at all unless the situation truly calls for it (job interviews and such). i feel like i have a good sense of social awareness, but i also feel like i unintentionally come off as intimidating or a jerk. it's just for some reason here at this university, the constant lectures and bulletins keep encouraging people that it's ok not not have everything figured out, that it's ok to not be this and that, and i know i might be blowing things out of proportion, but it seems like if these bulletins don't apply to you, then what are you even doing here? you must be doing something wrong. you should feel insecure about everything. so sometimes i go through the day wondering if i should give more fucks about the smaller stuff and start thinking about the insecurities i currently have. i know it's not good to give no fucks at all, rather it's better to pripritize them for the important things with a limited supply instead of giving them out freely.for instance, whenever i'm out with college friends, they sometimes compliment me about how i seem to have all my shit figured out, although i really don't. my roommate constantly degrades her appearance, asking me if she looks ugly, if she should change something, if she should join this club, if i can go out with her, etc. and i usually just compliment her or tell her it's fine and doesn't matter that much, or whenever i'm exhaused don't say anything at all, but then she gets offended and continues degrading herself and it's awkward. i feel simultaneously more put together and insecure whenever situations like this happen, because i have my own insecurities about things, and this puts me into an existential crisis about my stage in life, and i feel even more pressured to bring them up to be more relatable, although i can't, because would they really understand? i brought some of them up with my roommate and one other friend once, on two seperate occasions, and they both shut me down, instead telling me something along the lines of 'wow you seem to have your shit figured out.' but that doesn't make me feel better or help at all. i'm not particularly stressed about exams, but i feel like i'm doing something wrong by sleeping early and playing video games during most of the day. i used to go out a lot when i was a teenager in real middle and high school, but now that i'm an adult i rarely feel fomo whenever a party happens anymore (which is like every single day) or whenever people are going out doing stuff. for some reason, i feel like i should feel fomo even though i prefer staying in. what i really want is to surround myself with just a few high-quality people i feel comfortable with and have shared hobbies and values with, and get together sometimes, if not routinely, but it seems almost impossible to find. people here either want to go out constantly or not at all, and even though it's easy making friends, i can't keep them down.what can i do to catch up to everyone else? i always feel behind, like i'm not doing enough, maybe i should take on another project? but my old ones won't get finished, and i always get to a point where i'm stuck. but if i don't do this, how will i get ahead and stand out when it comes to employment? i want to pursue projects i'm genuinely interested in, but should i care more about employment-related ones? and also, i don't even have the proper skillsets to finish the ones i'm working on. everyone's on linkedin, instagram, and whatsapp now, getting married, traveling for conferences and work, and there's me, happening to get really passionate about the field i want to get into 10 years too late and trying to stay off social media, yet still creating accounts to not fall behind. then there's the guy my age who just retired after teaching a graduate-level course for his entirety of high school years in the field because he got really into it right on time. but then i'm super jealous because intead of falling into the ratrace like me and everyone else, he decided to pursue what he was passionate about and perfect his skills instead of mindlessly going through preschool cramming for useless aptutude tests that really don't measure the quality of the individual or the aptitude. it's like we're all in a lab but people like him escaped somehow.then i have to make sure to stay above a 3.2 gpa, but if i don't get near a 4.0 then my chances at being accepted into the other college decrease by something like 80%. i constantly feel stupid, especially in language classes where i'm learning at an elementary level and still get confused from time to time.i know i should care more about living my best life and stop comparing myself to others, but it gets difficult whenever i think about things like this. although i stopped caring about social media and trends around 5 years ago, now it seems like i have to start again just to be able to have something to talk about, but i'm not really interested so i don't for the most part.that's why whenever i'm with my friends who are pursuing their masters/phd, i feel simultaneously secure and insecure about myself as well. i feel like it's more socially acceptable to act and feel confident about myself and give less fucks about small things like appearance or trends, so it's less of a social burden, and i feel less anxiety and more comfortable around them, but at the same time i feel behind and wish i could be where they are now, especially the ones who are in the field i want to get into. i especially hate it whenever they tell me 'you'll figure it out eventually' because i feel even more behind. around my college friends, i'm the one who has things figured out. around my other friends, i'm the one with tons of potential who will eventually have things figured out. i hate being told i have it all figured out, but also hate being told the opposite.either way i still feel discontent and insecure about my stage in life in general. i feel like i'm going through a quarter-life crisis, does anyone else feel the same way?",0,3,"If university is elementary school for adults, then I'm back to wishing I was in high school again.",Adult

1835,"i believe that this is first off likely only relatable if you're my age or older. i'm 32.  when i was growing up, in the 90's and early 00's, my family was middle class and each year before school started my mother would take me to buy a new pair of trainer/tennis shoes for the year. we would make a day of it, but it usually was all done at one mall or shops in the center of town, and i'm unable to remember any tougher time i couldn't find a pair of shoes i would like within going to just 2-3 stores.  but depending on how much i'd outgrown my current pair, these were the shoes i'd be stuck with for the next year (also living where it had all 4 seasons) until basically i got my first job and had my own income (but even then, i spend it mostly on food).  i look back at this now and find it odd i could commit to one pair so easily.  for school, after school, golfing with my dad, playing soccer/biking with my neighborhood friends weekends..  i would have a full costume on halloween but wear the same shoes and not give any shit about it.  but getting to the point my question is that i am always buying new pairs of casual shoes as an adult.  why? because other than the shopping and errands i do to support myself, and a job where i'm on my feet more than school years, i don't find my personality or personal time to be all that different.   i'm just an average joe, jason bateman or similar type  i think that shoes were less attention growing then as they are today, and even the biggest sellers were sticking with monotone or two-tone and those colors being of white/black/brown.  my dad was a teacher, so he had (i guess) a black and brown pair for work, and tennis shoes for leisurely backyard things, but i don't recall him often caring about getting a new pair.  he has a closet with older pairs that i think he never went into. this is what i thought would happen to me. once my feet stopped growing, i'd basically have the same shoes for longer and longer, and here's the interesting thing- not desire anything else when i was wearing casual shoes around the house or running errands.  i guess the idea of having a stockpile of shoes was for just a matriarchal and fashion obsessed society.  but my mom loves flats, and tennis shoes, so from both sides i saw no heavy inborn burden for walking shoes keeping up with changes.    now here's the thing about it.  like i said earlier, when i was working my first fast food job making minimum wage at 16, the paycheck would go to the bank to save up for a car, and i'd keep about $40-50 for spending money which was often too much cause i didn't use if on anything but a stop at 7-11 or fast food.  i didn't go buying clothing unless it was for replacing something that was worn out.  that was '04-06.  i guess i had no hobbies other than golfing in the summers.  so i guess i'm just trying to reason the problem down to a few answers.  either my brain and personality was still growing in my teens and late teens (not dating until later as well) and not until my early 20s and late 00's would having the outdated pair of shoes anger me.  does my childhood religion (irish catholic-&gt; agnostic today) have any influence on a reason why i need more shoes today?    or, at about the same time, online shopping exploded, our new internet based industrial revolution came and shoe culture as a result went much more overblown and outrageous and the monotones went away?   and because of this of just happening to go on the same time i was maturing to the man i am now, is just coincidence.    more other questions:  wasn't there some sort of society stigma back in the 90s for owning several pairs because it was well advertised that ""kids in africa"" had no shoes?  or what that just in my own family? was that only what middle class parents said to their kids?  why is it gone?  why are my shoes getting worn out quicker than i think my dad's did? how much does being a man factor into this?

2007,"hello everyone. in about 300 days i will be 30 years old. i have this weird feeling about that age and higher because it is usually associated with most people completwely settling into life with their partners and kids, and essentially the spontaneity if doing fun random stuff like in your 20s becomes much less, and monotony sets in. not to mention your body starts to feel older and you start to also look oldish, so i fear when i see my older reflection it will just be a daily reminder that fun is mostly over from here on out, especially as you'll now be seen as the old dude to younger groups (which i wouldnt care about looking older if this wasnt a phenomenon i have literally seen in certain activities i partake in (paintball, clubbing, etc), where the older dudes just kinda get silently shunned by the rest of everyone there. not sure if this is true everywhere but i have seen it many times).at any rate, the one good thing is i have a base of a few very close friends, and i also have taken great care of my body over the last decade (health conscious family), so i can still athletically perform like i am early to mid twenties and also visually look around that age which is nice i guess. but regardless of how i look or feel, i am still treading on getting older, and do not know how to handle the dread i perceive to be approaching as my life changes. i tried sharing this concern with my friends and they say well at least you look young. that is a random perk that does not do much. even if i felt and looked 25 at 40 it would not matter. . . because all of my friends whom i had fun with in my earlier days, they will sort of start to fade away as their lives, an mine go on and become more settled. and i am just, afraid of that. did anyone else ever struggle with this type of thinking while approaching thirty? am i wrong in my judgement?anyone in their 30s or 40s that never really had a partner/kidsw, and was able to continue doing fun stuff on a fairly regular basis despite in other areas being settled?",3,1,Input from all of my fellow adults,Adult

( i don't need lifetime oil change ) my dad told me when you go to dealerships say no to the extra or not useful warranties. he really wouldn't let me say no so i asked to call my dad, my dad said say yes to the warranty after hearing and no to the oil. i think the guy was finally satisfied and we finished signing the paper. its understandable but at the same time he would not accept the fact that i would say no from things. in the end i did $1,000 debit and $2,000 on a hold check till the first rolls around.   overall the deal i got is great, the car is nice, but the way the situation was handled does not sit right with me and still hasn't. i talked to my parents, boyfriend, and best friends about it. they told me that its fine and it already happened. that the way it was handled was not correct as they should've got my verbal consent that i wanted it after the credit check, the payment ect. on the other hand i should have been stern and told them i would think about it or see if we could discuss a plan for the car. even if they would say no i should have stood my ground. honestly i want to know where i went wrong, was i not  stern or tell them i wanted to wait, should i just walked off the lot? did i not understand their process? i have a lot of anxiety so what someone worries about its 1000x in my head that repeats till i fall asleep. personally what do you think of the situation? it already happened so how do i deal with my anxiety? i am an adult now but i feel lost about everything.",3,1,"TLDR: getting a car the same day not completely ready , dealership anxiety, hate being a adult",Adult

(i have seriously never had a single vacation in my life so this was a big deal for me) - my company gives me two weeks of vaca time and im so burned out and exhausted for never having more than a 3 day weekend in forever. my fiance was livid when i mentioned that i may not have enough pto to do our trip this year because every year i never have time off with my types of jobs and money is tight. we've been together 8 years and haven't even gone away for the weekend. i knew i'd have to take time off for my grandmother once she passes and to take time to help with getting the house across the country sold and getting my grandfather set up. so when my mom reached out to me saying to take off a few days i kinda freaked. i don't know how to say no, i don't want to go but i feel like a selfish ass. no one guilts my siblings or cousins about not visiting and im not even the oldest. yet im being guilted big time. is it so horrible if i don't go? maybe im writing this because i need someone to be mean and call me out and tell me to suck it up or something but right now im torn because im not even a year into a new job and im having a mental breakdown with not having a break. visiting her is not a break. its cleaning the house and cooking and to be honest, my mom doesn't work so she has the time to do this. i know family should come first, but she doesnt remember me. idk does anyone have any advice. i know im being selfish but i guess just hearing from anyone would help. i asked a friend who told me to go, but this friend has also taken 4 weeks of vaca every year for many years and has no idea the level of burn out i feel. i've been messing up at work im so tired. being selfish is so frowned upon.

3535,"in literally just 3 days i’m turning 21. the big 21. the age when everyone considers you as a real adult and starts taking you more serious. ever since i was around 12/13, i’ve had horrible social anxiety and sadly a huge lack of a social life. i mean i was popular in school, nobody was mean to me, most people loved me because i was sweet and kind. i talked to my mom about my lack of social life and she said it’s because i was just so quiet it just made me seem unapproachable, which i believe her. like i said, people really liked me. i just never really talked unless i was spoken to first, or had to talk for certain reasons. i could never hold a conversation and still can’t. one, because i have a fear of saying something and it will sound stupid and embarrassing, and two, i just genuinely never know what to say as stupid as that sounds. i get all panicky when socializing. so i most likely came off as rude and uninterested. in school i would get invited to hang out with others and join them in some activities. i just too quiet and everyone thought i was just simply “shy.” it wasn’t until only a few years ago i realized it went much more deeper then just shyness and that’s when i figured i have social anxiety. like it’s hard for me to order my own food from restaurants or fast food places for example, although recently it has sort of gotten better. not quite, but a little. i used to always have my mom order my food for me. same thing for paying for anything like food, clothes, groceries, etc... and you’re not gonna believe this, but at almost 21, i’ve actually never payed for groceries yet and i’ve only ever payed for my own clothes like maybe twice in my life. i hate to stay it but i still cling to my parents like a helpless child because of my anxiety. so i really feel like it has caused me to be so emotionally behind everyone my age. i never even went to university or college. while most people my age are already about to graduate and have moved out of their parents house. and i’m not gonna lie when i say that moving out terrifies me so freaking much. luckily i have parents who say i can live with them for as long as i want. they actually love having me around. but i feel embarrassed. i’ve never even had a “real” job. i only just got my first job cleaning a bank after they close for a little over an hour monday-saturday. super easy. but it’s only $500 a month. my mom is also doing that job with me too. i hate it so much that i’m like this and i feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. i’ve only ever had two best friends my whole life and that’s it. one who i’m still best friends with to this day since kindergarten and the other i haven’t seen since around 2013/2014 because she had to move and we just lost contact with each other. but yeah. i’ve never had an actual “friend group” like the majority of people my age and younger. and i seriously feel like my time is running out to get out there and make many friends and memories. kim taehyung, my idol is a social butterfly who’s always been popular even before idol life. he’s always been able to make friends and he’s always been very popular. in school and now. why can’t i be like that? why am i the exact opposite of that? and i feel like that if he ever met me he would hate me and think i’m so boring and want nothing to do with... and i know he’s not shallow like that. but my mind tells me all these things. like why would a social butterfly wanna even try to be friends with a boring girl with bad social anxiety and has no social life? it would be such a waste of time for someone like him. and honestly, i just d word because of the way i am especially at my age. it hurts and it eats at me every single day of my life.",2,1,(Serious) I’m literally anxious af about adulthood and growing up,Adult

3683,"23f and earlier this year i moved into the first place where i live on my own. it's a house converted into an upper and lower apartment and the landlady lives in the lower unit. she's nice enough, but has a lot of quirks that drive me up a wall. one, she's a conspiracy theorist and with this pandemic i haven't heard the end of it. and two, aka the issue that is fucking with my routines the most, she contradicts herself constantly. examples include:-the previous tenant messed up the electricity and made some lights and sockets unusable until she can get an electrician out, so she said she would take off a little bit of last months rent to compensate. she ended up talking about how my rent is her only income and so she could really only take off like $10.-i have a dog and the written lease says ""regular poop pickup"", which i have been doing every week on wednesday since trash gets collected thursday mornings. that's a routine we specified when i signed the lease in the first place. now the weather is getting warmer she wants it more than once a week which i understand.  i had planned on upping it to 3 times a week or every other day anyways depending on how often my dog went #2. she is trying to say that when i had signed the lease she had already told me to up poop pickup to every day barring bad weather when it got warm. she definitely did not. she said ""regular"" and i had been keeping to a schedule but i don't necessarily have the time or the amount of trash bags handy to pick up poop every day. -because of covid-19, we came up with a plan for my rent this month. she can't waive it because, as specified, my rent is her only income. i had some issues with my job before the social distancing issues. basically i had gotten another job offer and start date, quit my existing job in preparation, and then never heard anything because the pandemic started becoming more serious and messing with business procedures. she understood that it was a sticky situation and said this: "" try to come up with at least half or 3/4 if you can, and we can take the rest out of the security deposit for now to at least pay the house bills (water and heat). we can work out replacing the security deposit later"". i got a signed note giving her permission to do so from the family who co-signed with me. now she is saying she really isn't supposed to and doesn't want to dip into the deposit at all and is pressuring me to collect unemployment money (which im trying to work out but my state is being stupid) and pay the rest of the rent asap. like, we had a plan set and now she is messing with it. she said she won't evict me given the circumstances and she is nice and neighborly otherwise but her contradicting herself all the time is getting on my last nerve. that and she tends to overshare and turn her personal issues into my issues too. but i feel weird confronting her about any of it because i'm an inexperienced renter and have bad credit because of financial medical issues when i was in college, and she was one of the only landlords in the area that looked past the credit and understood that i'm trying my best to rebuild and even then it was a close call because she would only rent to me if my family cosigned. so i feel like i'm looking a gift horse in the mouth if i confront her. that and i'm not sure i could get another place right now and i can't move in with family because that's just a toxic living situation in itself.tldr my landlady was nice enough to rent to me but a lot of aspects of her personality are driving me insane and i'm afraid of confronting her and seeming ungrateful",22,8,Landlady contradicts herself and it's driving me up a wall.

(it's under the rim of the toilet bowl, so i have to literally stick my head down in the toilet bowl to see it, but it's there.)&amp;#x200b;my question is, do i have a reasonable case to terminate my lease without the termination fee?  i have records of these events and am now starting to document damage to my property (the college diploma).  i really don't want this to be a drawn-out process of having to test for mold and call in mold inspectors; i just want to be done with this apartment and move on.  does anyone have any advice or experience with this?",2,3,Mold in my apartment,Adult

5787,"i’m very embarrassed and mad at myself; i rear-ended a car earlier this week. to make matters more embarrassing, it was an uber with a passenger in it. we were only going a few miles an hour (boston traffic) so i just touched it. we both pulled over, got out to assess the damage, and exchanged phone numbers and took pictures of the cars, our licenses, and registrations. since he had a passenger he needed to get going. since we were going so slow, there wasn’t really any visible damage. maybe a scratch, but i don’t think it was my car based on the location. i told him to let me know what he thinks and contact me if he needs. it’s been three days and i haven’t heard anything. obviously it was my fault and if he needs repairs then i’ll pay up, but i’m so anxious not knowing. how long does it normally take for someone to contact the person who hit them for payment? or file a claim? i’ve heard it’s better to not go through insurance for fender benders, is this true? and will i have to convince this guy to forgo insurance involvement? i’m just so lost in all this. thanks in advance!",2,6,How long after an accident do people usually file a claim?,Adult

6261,"so i just had this conversation with my younger brother and thought i share it here too.air travel can be intimidating, but it isn't hard, especially if you take a few steps to make it easier.checking in:this is pretty strait forward. first, be sure to arrive at least an hour before your flight. boarding usually starts about 20-30 minutes before take-off. if it's a big airport maybe get there 1.5 hours sooner,, and 2 hours for an international flight. go to the check in desk for the airline you are flying with. if you are going with multiple airlines go with the one you are flying on first. almost all airports now have kiosks where you can do most of your check in. you can just just swipe a debit or credit card and it will bring up your info. if you need to check a bag or suitcase instead of carrying it on the plane after checking in you'll be sent to an agen. have the tickets the machine gave you and an id ready. driver's license is fine, but if you are going international you'll need your passport. if they don't do it already you can ask and they'll point you at which direction to go.securityi don't know why, but people freak out over this. this is also where the most hold up is to be found. you'll wait in line a bit and then have to show a tsa agent your boarding pass and id. they'll make a few marks on your pass and then move to the scanners. at this point you are going to have to take off your shoes, belt or suspenders, and empty everything in your pockets into a big tray. yes, your cell phone is going too. if you have a laptop or tablet in your carry-on bag it needs to come out and go in a tray. there is usually someone there telling people this over and over. yet people still want to fight and argue. they always lose. don't fight with the tsa, you will absolutely lose. it may be rediculous, but you will not get to keep the water bottle you brought from home to save money. or a can of soda, big bottle of hand sanitizer, that pocket knife your grandfather gave you, none of it. i've seen so many things get taken and lost a few myself. i once lost a multi-tool knife i had since i was 15, carried it through two deployments, and many jobs. just missed it when i packed my carry-on. they will offer you the opportunity to go put it in your car, sent it in the mail or put it in luggage, but this may not be a possibility for you. so be sure to check your bags carefully. once on the scanner you will go through a metal detector. you may have to get a pat down there. it's not uncommon to miss a coin or a key or something in your pockets. if they are not, you can request that the person patting you down is the same sex as you. don't ask for someone of the same race, i've seen that go poorly. you may also have to get your bags checked. it's not a big deal. you'll be asked to open the bag and perhaps remove some contents. if they tell you something isn't allowed you'll be given some options as mentioned earlier, but don't fight it. if you do want to go out to your car or whatever you'll have to come back through security. after you're done there you can put on your shoes, fill your pockets and go to your gate.going to the gatethis easy, just follow the signs. you may have to travel by tram to different parts, like in denver they have 3 main concourses (a, b, and c) then numbered gates within. so if your gate is b23 you take the tram to concourse b, the follow the signs to gate 23. minneapolis is laid out more in a horseshoe shape, they use letters and numbers and you just have to follow the signs to get there. there are also maps all around.if you are at a bigger airport you'll probably have some shops and restaurants you can go into. medium airports will have an a la carte style shoppette with a few basic things, and small airports might have some vending machines. prices will be marked up a little but its really not too bad. if you want to get some better food or some drinks for the flight its not a bad idea.boarding and flyingunless its a smaller plane, you will board in groups. parents with small children, the disabled, and people who need extra time or assistance (like the very elderly) will go first. the the higher class passengers like first or business class passengers. the rest of us economy peasants are broken into 3-5 groups. your boarding group is on your pordind pass, you can board anytime after your group but if you try to go before you'll get turned away.once on the plane you can find your seat. there are little diagrams at every row telling you what the row number is and which seat is which. if you are a bit on the bigger side you can ask for a seatbelt extension if you need it. you won't be able to recline your seat or use the tray until after you are up in the air. more planes have entertainment systems on them now and should have at least something you'll enjoy. depending on they length of your flight you'll at least get a quick service with drinks and snacks like nuts, pretzels, or cookies. longer flights will offer a meal, you'll have 2 or 3 choices (one of which is vegetarian). there might also be an opportunity to buy better food or premium drinks like alcohol. layoversif you have a stop on the way you may not have your next gate on your boarding pass. but there are usually big screens that have that information. look under departures and look for the city you are flying to, then look at the flight number (its on the boarding pass). if you are having trouble you can ask a gate agent and they can look it up. there is also a possibility you'll have to move to a different terminal and go through security again. at denver you don't have to, but in boston you do.arrivalonce you get to your destination its pretty simple, if you are traveling internationally you'll go through border control and customs. its pretty simple, you'll show your passport and answer a few questions about your plans and maybe about what you have in your luggage.its not a big deal. from there you go to baggage claim. if you are not flying international you just go strait to baggage claim. there are screens that have the flight number and where it came from, usual over the carousel. it might take a few minutes for luggage to start coming out. once it does you wsit for your stuff, grab it and leave the airport. few extra tips:-dress comfortably, i get hot easily so i usually wear light loose layers. my wife is the opposite and usually brings a hoodie. -plan your carry-on. bring medicine you need of course. but if it is liquid try to get individual packets. you can get small packets of drink mixes too. a tablet can be a good way to entertain yourself on a flight, as well as a book that doesn't need to be turned off during take off and landing. pack charging cables too. i also reccomend battery packs for charging electronics on the plane. they are super handy and worth the money to get one that holds more charge.-prep for security. wear shoes that are easy to remove, but are comfortable. i usually stick my keys in my carry-on bag until i return home. and i try to have as little in my pockets as possible. i try to basically just drop everything in the bin and move forward as quick as possible. then when i'm through i can grab my stuff and throw on my shoes all in 2 minutes and be on my way.upgradesif you have never flown first class or business class on a decently long flight (2+ hours) i gotta tell you, its awesome. it can also be very expensive. there are some nice perks like  boarding the plane first and decorating first. your luggage comes out first. plus the seats are way nicer and you get better service, food, and drinks on the flight included. you can of course by your ticket for that class, but this is the most expensive way. you can buy a regular ticket and upgrade it, this is often much less expensive. sometimes the price goes down if you upgrade when you check in. don't be afraid to ask if an upgrade is available and how much it would be.if you travel a lot you can get on a frequent flyer program and with a high enough tier you will get free upgrades.",0,1,Tips for Air

6525,"i (21f) moved back in with my family in march due to the covid-19 pandemic. this is obviously something that a lot of people my age have had to do and so i’m not really ashamed of this. lockdown has taught me that i cannot live in this house after i graduate. i moved out the minute i turned 18 and this whole experience has been proof positive that i was right to escape when i did. i am absolutely miserable. things were okay for the first few weeks but things have rapidly gone south over the past week or so. my dad swore at me a few days ago and we haven’t spoken since. i don’t eat dinner with my family anymore and we try to limit our interactions as much as possible because everything descends into a huge fight if we spend too much time together. this is all made worse by the fact that they live in a soulless, boring town with next to no transport links. things probably wouldn’t be very different even if we weren’t under lockdown because there would be nothing to do here anyway. i absolutely hate this whole situation and i’m desperate to go back to my old life. i’ve realised that i’ll need to seriously work on my finances if i want to go back to my old life. i’m awful at budgeting. numbers just do not make sense to me at all and so i really struggle with my finances. i was diagnosed with dyscalculia (the numerical version of dyslexia) when i was ten years old and so that’s probably why i’m so bad with money. i was already in debt but i became pretty depressed at the end of 2019. i tried to chase my feelings away with drinking heavily and spending recklessly. this utterly drained the last of my finances. i’ve fallen into this trap of being scared to check my own account because the number on the screen sends me into an anxious spiral. this is obviously making my situation worse in the long run. things have been better financially since i moved back in with my parents. my outgoings are basically zero since i’m not paying rent, buying food for myself or going out at all. i have saved two months worth of student loans and i also got most of the deposit i put down on my flat returned. even with all of that i’m still deep into my overdraft. i just can’t picture a life where i’m not broke. i want to be independent but i need to be financially independent for that to happen.my aim is to get some savings behind me. i’m fed up living from student loan payment to student loan payment. i want to have a little bit of money behind me when i graduate in spring 2021, just to ensure that i don’t have to move back to this place again. i’m looking for supermarket jobs at the moment but i don’t have high hopes of finding anything right now. my plan for summer was to work in a kids camp in italy but that’s obviously not going to happen so i think that for now i’ll just focus on building some healthy financial habits. i need advice on how to build those habits. i never really had any kind of financial education and so i’m going to try and teach myself now. i need a budgeting app that’s very “user friendly” since i struggle with numbers on a regular basis. since i can’t really talk to my family about anything at all i need some practical advice from people who have dealt with this before. ideally i just need someone to actually explain money management to me since no one bothered to talk to me about money at all when i was growing up. if anyone has any advice for getting out of debt and dealing with anxiety around money then i’m all ears.",2,1,I want to be financially independent but I have no financial skills at all.

6534,"in the past i’d create a cleaning schedule for myself monday the bathroom... tuesday the kitchen... wednesday dusting everywhere... thursday the floors... friday the straightening/organizing...etc.with that system i often found myself:1. upset with how long everything took2. i’d put off stuff i didn’t want to do3. stressed because i put off the stuff i didn’t want to do, but really needed to doeventually i (24,f, living alone) gave up and just cleaned when i really needed to which ended up leaving stuff undone and taking up a ton of time when i actually decided to do it.one day i just decided i’d throw a half an hour every day on my calendar to clean. why not? a half an hour isn’t all that long and that probably about as long as it takes me to clean the bathroom or kitchen so i’ll probably get about one job done each day...wrong the first day i put on a timer, just so i’d know when to stop and got to cleaning the kitchen. i did all the regular maintenance cleaning in the kitchen and the timer hadn’t gone off. so i moved to the bathroom. did all the regular maintenance cleaning in the bathroom and still, my timer hadn’t gone off...i started cleaning the inside of my refrigerator since i clearly would have time to dust and do the floors the next day and finished wiping down all the surfaces before questioning whether or not i’d actually turned on my timer at all. i checked the timer and had a few seconds left before the time would go off...normally, the inside of the fridge was something i ignored because it’s something that needs to be done every couple or few months... but in that half hour i’d wiped down every surface in my kitchen and bathroom, the fridge, scrubbed the toilet bowl and cleaned the mirror... more than i would normally do in a day in a half an hour...what i quickly learned from doing this is that:1. you can do a lot more in 30 minutes than you think you can2. if you focus solely on cleaning for 30 minutes each day, you don’t get distracted and can get to things you might normally put offnow that i time myself while cleaning i can get to the things i need to do, even the ones i might normally put off because they’re difficult or boring, keep my apartment clean and if i’ve already done that i have extra time that week to do stuff i actually want to do.if i’ve maintenance cleaned my whole place by wednesday i’ll deep clean something on thursday and organize something on friday.if i’ve deep cleaned everything this month and everything is still organized from last month then i’ll dedicate thursday evening to something fun... like an art project or gaming and friday i’ll go out with friends.i also don’t stick to this 100% of the time and don’t feel like i have to because i have 30 minutes to spare tomorrow and i’m already on top of everything so why not go out for dinner with my boyfriend on wednesday?hopefully this helps someone. i feel like this has made a very positive change in my life and helped me feel like an actual adult...also: cleaning intervals can be adjusted to meet the needs of those with a tighter schedule, bigger home, roommates &amp;/or kids. i’ve just found 30 minutes to be ideal for me and a nice starting point since it’s such a small amount of time and you really can get more done than you think with the added pressure of a timer tl;dri time myself when i clean, i’ve found you can get a lot more done in 30 minutes than you think so i put a timer on my phone for 30 minutes (almost) every day and my apartment is (almost) always spotless by the end of the week",27,1,"A dumb, but life changing habit I’ve formed—I time myself when I clean",Adult

6786,"another year comes to an end and we move another year closer to death. its rather amusing, the concept of death lurking around any unspecific ordinary situation, the most consistent thing about this year has been the inconsistency that it had brought along. most of us entered (subjective to my social circle) 2020, with an amazing spark and outlook towards life. i personally progressed so much last year, that it made a world of difference to my personality and holistically to my existence. i took a leap of progress in terms of getting over the fear of commitment, academic fluency, the equilibrium between the flexibility and rigidity of my stance in different situations that i land myself into. yes, being accountable for my mistakes due to poor reasoning and choices has also come to an acknowledgment. coming from a close knitted nuclear family, it is extremely hard for me to make choices on my own which concerns my interest without upsetting or overlooking anybody’s feelings and requirements. this makes a cocoon of safety but at the same time, it creates a permanent and a hard to break out structure that does not allow me to afford taking small decisions about my life such as making impromptu trips with friends, taking a break from socializing for mental well-being, asking for privacy and staying out after 10.  following that context, i seemed to have finally came out of that cocoon because i moved to another state for college, rented my own flat and managed my monthly expenses; all of this gave me a little taste of liberty which was never experienced.my own room with no-one to knock on, with a door which can be latched, my own time for meals, my choice of meals, random night-outs, late-long night drives around through the quietest time of one of the busiest cities in the country i.e., new delhi.  sure, yes, living on coffee and consuming untimed meals does not really depict an ideal individual behavior, but i personally believe that on a journey of finding oneself, getting lost is an essential milestone. i started liking myself for the person i was becoming, i managed my own finances, i dealt with tight situations myself, i made my own decisions, and i was accountable for them. i guess i could ponder on this later xd.this random piece of text is an attempt to look around the events of 2020 and my observation of people over the internet. after we were forced to head back home from our colleges and jobs towards our hometown. it felt safe and sound because of all the chaos and death going around in the world; people were cherishing this lovely period as their best friends were in town and i think its safe to assume that it was the golden period of this year because of all the family members being present again under the same roof. then came the time where time stood still, everyone had heard all the crazy stories about everyone, there was no gossip left to forward, no celebrity breakups and no-good news from anywhere. what kept us sane was the internet- instagram, facebook, youtube and for those who could afford it- drugs, alcohol, and video games. you know how they say that everything is temporary? every drug has its effect limited to a time frame, then comes the downer and then sobriety hits home. people pursued old interests, picked up new hobbies, learnt instruments, dance etc. but humans being humans, they got tired of it and end of the day, everything remains bland and grey.what happened to the most energetic section of all the population demographic? the students eh? millions of them did not get a farewell, did not get to say goodbye to their best friends, and did not graduate. instead, they got their degrees through e-mails and whatsapp, universities shifting their lifelike boring classes to a screen making the education totally useless. i mean no disrespect to the teachers but if both the teachers and the students were asked the question of “how much were you able to actually teach /learn and how much of it do you think is effective/applicable in real life?”, my assumption could be wrong, but the assumption is a simple no, no we have not learnt shit, we do not like schools/colleges on computers and mobile phones but i guess itttiisswutitizzz.let us come back to the question of what happened to people, to enjoy the littlest moments in life, they have started measuring how big of a little moment they are having and how is it better than the person they meet every now and then. the question of who has more money and drip has become more important than who might need help or who might be the person on the verge of a breakdown. people follow these trends on tiktok and instagram where they must do weird shit to their bodies, dance on music they do not know the words to, swear in front of their respected individuals, lie about their mental well-being to seem edgy, act politically woke without studying an ounce of facts and so much more. i understand that people find pleasure in the littlest of things and moments but let us understand something together okay?we are living in an era where social validation has become more valuable than any currency in the forex market, it is something that an individual of every race, gender and age is feeding upon without any boundaries to content and risk of tremendous hatred hidden behind the curtains of anonymity. this trend culture has made people sell different parts of themselves to a mass of people who are there on the internet to consume media but are so fragile when it comes to content selection that if they do not like your voice, hair, eyebrows or even your size of nose, they will skip ahead. every alternate video is the same repetition of a joke revolving around one ancient subject… yeah you guessed it- sex! okay buddy, big deal, you have a huge penis, okay you have a small one, size does not matter, boobs are funny, cleavage is scandalous, you cheated on your significant other and that is cool because you are pretty and that does not make you any less of a good person because #fucknegativity.  people have become mean; they will not help another person if the other person does not have a favor they can return later.  now let’s come to what happened to music, let me be short with this one an quote some examples here:-real hot girl shitah(and if the beat live, you know lil ju made it)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odyody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (mwah)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah ah)ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odybody crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah, yeah)body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (mwah)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odyody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick rideleave it to the double thick thighs, twin sistersdrop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted upshe get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money upslide, slide in the bentley truck-a, the wraith truck-ayour bestie is a dick sucker, i big dub heras-salama-lama alaykum, you big hateryou nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussybring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussygive me everything you got for this wet-ass pussyhonestly, what the fuck happened back there?

medical certificate to support a possible enrolment transfer or fee free re-enrolment to all the assessments i had missed while i was falling apart.my med cert basically says i wasn’t fit for study between 1 october 2019 and 2 february 2020 because of my anxiety, possible personality disorder and a currently undiagnosed spectrum disorder (working on getting diagnosis for that personality disorder and aspergers syndrome).the tafe lady (we’ll call her kylie) never called me between the 13th and 20th of january like she said she would, and i figured she was probably really busy, so i waited another week and ended up trying to call her on jan 28. she wasn’t in her office so a message was left. she didn’t call back until jan 31, and in that call all she said was “email the med cert, i’ll put it through on monday and see if we can transfer you from last year’s class to this year’s class so you can start again.”the email didn’t go through when i sent it, and kylie didn’t contact me until feb 10 with an email from student management saying i hadn’t sent the certificate. the email came through while i was on the phone with student management, and expressed some frustration on the phone about how she hadn’t contacted me earlier, hadn’t contacted me herself, and that thus was dragging on when i was missing valuable class time and would need to catch up. student management recommended that i mention my frustrations to kylie in the email i already had to send (with the med cert). so i did. politely and respectfully, i mentioned that it had been almost a month since she got back to work after the christmas holiday, and i needed to sort out tafe before i could start volunteering again or look for part time work. that i couldn’t do anything without tafe being sorted out.on feb 11, kylie emailed back, saying she would begin the withdrawal process and consider a fee refund. i was so confused. i called student management again, hysterical, because i didn’t want to withdraw from the course, i wanted a course transfer. after calming me down a little bit, the wonderful angel in student management (she’s handled most of my calls and always helps so much) said she would contact kylie about the issue.feb 12 i received a form with the correct information on it to facilitate a course enrolment transfer and no fees, which is what i had discussed with kylie. she gave me 72 hours to sign and send back the form.feb 13 when i saw the form in my email, i had a few questions about the declaration at the end and sent another email asking these questions. mind you, only 30 hours had passed out of the 72 hours i was given. 4 hours later i received and email back from kylie, saying that it was too late and i couldnt transfer as the enrolments for january had closed and i could re-enrol in july if i wanted to, but “without your consent in time your enrolment cannot be processed and now the jan 2020 intake is closed”.i was livid.feb 14 i went into my campus office with every intention of staying right there until the situation was fixed. i was sick of false claims, broken promises, and most of all the stress of having my entire life in someone else’s hands. when i got to the help desk the person there didn’t know much about my issue, so she called someone down from the same department as kylie to hear what had been happening and help sort it out. there were a few tears, because i was so overwhelmed and stressed, but i managed to get through it all, and had written up a document with all the dates and details which i gave to the lady as evidence, as well as a copy of my medical certificate and my psych referral. when i finished explaining what had happened, the lady went to get kylie’s boss, explained to her what was happening and brought her down to see me so that we could talk about outcomes.she told me that enrolments for january had closed on feb 5 and that i shouldn’t have been sent the form, but she had the ability to bend the rules and asked if there was anything she could do to help me catch up with my peers once i’m re-enrolled.all i asked was that i be given extensions on all my units and that kylie would be spoken to about her actions and lack of communication and assistance throughout the whole ordeal. now i am re-enrolled, i have extensions and have been asked to directly contact kylie’s boss with any issues in the future. i start next week!",3,1,"I took charge and took care of it, and I am so proud of myself.",Adult

(also i posted basically this exact same thing in r/raisedbynarcissists . the only difference is the other one just has more of my family history if you want to go look.) long, long story short i'm grown. i'm 19 and i still live with them. they think that they taught me how to be an adult, but they didn't. i love them. i truly do. they have gotten a lot better over the past few years as far as them being... not the greatest, but they did the very classic switch that has thrown a lot of people like me off. expecting me to go from the infantilized version of me they made to a brand new adult version of myself over night. i don't have any life skills from being sheltered and homeschooled growing up. i have depression, anxiety, and a slew of other issues. but i'm trying my best to put myself out there. i got a car! i got my license this year and driving that thing has opened up *so* many happy moments. if i could i would *never* leave my car, i love the feeling of freedom so much. but also, i don't have a job. and due to covid along with worsening deoression episodes i'm flunking community college.

8228,"hi, everyone. i’ll try to keep this as succinct as possible.i’m almost 24. i have loving parents who pay for my everything and always have, but i want to become independent and move out soon. because i’m so dependent they have rules and expectations (not allowed to date, for example, among others) that i think impede my growth and freedom as an adult that’s unhealthy for my age. never minding the rules, the dependence and delay in life experiences alone is unhealthy i think.i graduated college in 2019 with a music performance degree. music was the most interesting thing for me to major in, the college was cheap and local and i got good scholarships there, i learned a lot, but because the degree was in classical singing and i’ve learned that my interests are in pop/contemporary singing, im training my voice in this style for my future career. however, covid has shut down performance opportunities whether pop or opera so it’s not possible to earn money from this right now anyway.aside from one being retired and the other having another job, my parents have a fiction writing business and i help out a lot (edit all books, help with illustrations, etc.), but to be honest, we have yet to be profitable. also, for the past 8 months, i work online (about 5 hours a day) for minimum wage pay as an esl tutor, just to earn some money during covid.that’s the background. my question.i’m considering creating my own business (most likely non music related because training and networking will take years before becoming profitable) since i have time and a great safety net to do this, and hopefully it can become my reliable income by time i move out (which i’d like to do in 1.5 years in the latest).but, i don’t have any strong ideas what the business could be. i always imagined this business being my income while i travel and slowly develop my music career on the side, and my parents have always encouraged entrepreneurship, but i’m so stuck right now.i could stay at home and keep working for my family business, but who knows how long that will take for it to be profitable, and that would also delay my adult independence. it would have to be staying at home because my parents aren’t comfortable with sending manuscripts through email for editing (possibility of someone else stealing or seeing their work before released), so i would actually have to stay home.and i could also get a full time job, or waitress or something, but yet my parents are highly concerned about covid and wouldn’t let me get an in person job right now, and i wonder if finding a remote one would be difficult. the car i drive is also their car, technically, so they have ultimate say over this. furthermore, if i have time to create a business i’d like to take that chance instead, but again, i’m stuck at what to do.not to mention that everyone says “travel when you’re young”, which i plan on doing 100% financially funded by me, but i feel like i’m both stuck in this current predicament and also losing years to do this young traveling.any advice for my situation would be very much appreciated.**tl;dr -- i've depended on my parents for my entire life and now need to be independent. stuck between creating my own business, getting a job, or staying and working for the family business.**",7,1,Trying to go from spoiled dependence to adult independence.

795,"in the past few months, i've been asked many times by many different people to explain to them how the new covid-19 vaccine works. first, i'm delighted at people's willingness to ask and the want to understand a complex topic. secondly, i'm honored they asked me. i am not a teacher, not a doctor, i don't work in a medical field with patients and i don't have any degrees beyond a humble bachelor's of science. what i do have is a knack for speaking to people. i enjoy talking and having conversations. the best way to have any conversation is to positively engage people in the topics and actively listen to what they have to say. it's nice. so, because i have had the opportunity of explaining how rna vaccines work to a delightful range of people while also having a good time of it, i want to share how i do that. this isn't actually about how rna vaccines work, but more of how i recommend having a conversation about them. i want to put some tips here for those knowledge-happy folks out there who may find this type of conversation wildly out of their comfort level.1) find your listeners ""level"".rna vaccines are a complex topic and can be very difficult to explain. i've found one of the best ways of finding out how much, and what type, of explaining i need to do is to ask my listener to explain to me how they understand ""normal"" vaccines work. that gives me a lot of information. how they explain concepts to me is how they understand concepts. if they draw a picture (or use their hands a lot) they're likely a visual learner and i try to grab a pen and paper. if they use lots of technical terms, i'm speaking to someone who would not appreciate a kindergarten-style breakdown. if my listener can't seem to deliver a confident explanation of how vaccines work, i know i have to start with basics and work my way up from there. asking what they know about vaccines also does two more things. it lets me hear any misunderstandings they have about vaccines that i may need to clear up before we move on to rna vaccines. if i can ensure my listener knows how vaccines works it makes them feel like they have a chance at understanding the ""new"" one. it makes the knowledge of how vaccines work a reliable baseline we can both reference when confusion about the new one arises. the last thing asking about their vaccine understanding does it allows them to speak, speak first, and set the tone. no one likes a one-sided akward conversation. i want them to talk with me. 2) avoid, i mean really really make an effort here, telling them they are ""wrong"".there is a lot of misinformation out there, and especially around vaccines. i've heard it all, or at least i really hope i have. no one, especially people who come to me asking about how something works, wants to hear they are wrong. that's not why they came to me. they came to understand, and that is my focus. i don't say:""wow that is absolutely not true!""""who told you that? she's crazy.""""hahahaha, no. that's not how it works.""no one likes to hear these things. people don't want to stay in a conversation where they or their sources of information are insulted. they came for understanding, not criticism.a way i've found of avoiding telling someone they are wrong while also correcting misunderstandings, is to ask them if i can explain how i understand the concept. asking them for permission gives me the invitation into this difficult discussion with them. i avoid directly saying that what i explain is the correct concept, as that implies they are incorrect. if they have questions about how my explanation is different then theirs i focus only on the reasons behind the difference. i explain only my ""version"" of the concept. i don't directly correct their previous understandings, unless they ask me to, as they are already attempting to do so themselves by asking me questions.3) celebrate and build knowledge.without a basic understanding of cellular biology, true understanding of rna vaccines is near impossible. biology is not everyone's favorite subject and many people find it both boring and difficult. so, regardless of if your listener has a master's degree or slept through biology in high school, acknowledge any knowledge they do have and celebrate it. science yeah! if they know what a nucleus is and that it contains your dna, acknowledge that they are correct and are already on their way to understanding rna! try to use the terms and concepts they know as much as possible to show their knowledge contributed to the conversation. it will be their anchor as you begin to build on it to explain more complex topics.""you already know dna contains important information. we both understand how precious dna is to the body, and your cells work hard to protect it too. that's why dna lives in the nucleus. it's very safe there. did you know dna never leaves the nucleus? this is why rna is so neat....""4) go slowly, and watch for clues.don't rush understanding. people learn at different speeds and with different styles.  if your listener suddenly got quiet, goes glassy eyed or stopped asking questions, be sure to stop and ask how they are doing. this is a conversation, not a lecture. ask if there is anything you can do or further explain to help them.you may have to scrap your delivery halfway though with a quick ""i'm sorry, i am going too far into details that don't help. can i start over?"" sometimes taking time to repeat yourself or incorporate the same concept in a different example pays off in reinforcing understanding.5) allow yourself to be interruptedif your listener has a question, that means they are thinking. thinking is what we both want! this conversation isn't about you or some show of your knowledge. don't allow the opportunity to work with them as they develop new concepts to pass you by. tell them they are free to stop you at any point for questions. try to understand or address a reason they have the question, it's part of acknowledgement. often enough, the question they have was something you were about to say which is yet another opportunity to praise them for their understanding.""i'm so glad you asked about virus varients. they're all over the news right now and it's scary. you understand how vaccines work! what if covid-19 mutates on the protein we just trained your body to fight? that's no good. well, the scientists who developed this thought of that and here is why you hear the vaccines still work.....""6) don't fret over detailsit would take hours and lots of chalk to explain to someone the exact process of an rna vaccine. ain't nobody got time for that. people want understanding, not a degree. sometimes all someone wants to know about it is a specific question like ""does it alter my dna?"" or ""is it safe?"". i make sure to steer the conversation to answer their core questions which means i may skip details like how the rna vaccine actually gets into your cells or what type of protein it produces. i can always talk to those details after i get to their main query or i will incorporate them into one of their questions if it's relevant. i do try to at minimum establish a basic understanding of vaccines but the level of detail i go into is very specific to the person. as long as you're seeing a correct understanding of the concepts reflected in your conversation, you've accomplished the goal and that was the whole point. you can stop explaining details. don't bore them you nerd.when i am faced with someone with less than a basic understanding of biology, i resort to speaking to the concepts by comparing them to something non-biological. this is actually my favorite style of conversation because it can be really fun. i once explained rna thusly: ""the queen in her palace needs to get a message to her blacksmith, so instead of walking and talking to him (which would expose her to danger) she writes a secret coded message that when the blacksmith reads it he know what he needs to build. also the message explodes after he's done reading it.""the shortest comparison i've come up with (and one i'm most proud of) is: ""so normal vaccines work by dragging dead or dying enemies through the village that is your body and shouting 'these are the bad guys! look at them!'. rna vaccines work by asking you to print a wanted poster.""being creative, even if your delivery isn't perfect, is fun for you both and again, this is a conversation. you can always try again. 7) you don't know everything. sorry, but you don't. being honest about this to yourself and even your listener is appreciated. if my listener has a question i don't know an answer to i'm not going to risk being yet another source of misinformation. i firstly compliment them for asking such a good question, acknowledge why they are asking and if they have time, we learn together! sometimes it's a technical question where the articles from google may be above their level. or there are a lot of bad, misleading articles. i offer to quickly read up on the topic for them and when i feel confident i come back to them with the answer. i truly enjoy having these conversations, and the real understanding that my friends and family achieve makes this crazy pandemic a little less stressful. these tips may not work for everyone, and you don't have to find each of them useful but i hope they helped at least one other soul out there engage in one of these important conversations.",3,1,LPT: Talking about RNA vaccines,Adult

2749,"**some background:**i just re-refinanced my student loans (more on that shortly). i first refinanced about 80,000 in graduate student loans a little over a year ago. when i did so, i dropped my interest rate almost a full 2.5 percent (from a 6.8% variable interest rate down to a 4.09% fixed rate), while also cutting the payment schedule of my loan from about 25 years to 10 years. this refinance also consolidated the “shell game” of paying off multiple student loans (some subsidized, some unsubsidized, some pell grants, etc.) across four or five different loan service providers, each of whom seemed to change every 6-12 months. in short, this refinance took what was a stressful and confusing and frustrating amount of bookkeeping and organized my loans in a single, much more affordable, and manageable debt.i know that refinancing isn't always the best move for everyone because federal loans have certain protections in place (grace periods, deferment, income-based repayment, etc.), but my financial situation and credit score improved (800+ credit score now!) so much since the time i was in college about 10 years ago that this seemed like a wise move. given the tens of thousands of dollars this saved me over the total course of my loan, i feel like this was one of the best financial decisions i ever made. obviously, research your loans and your loan providers before deciding. i'm not a certified financial advisor or anything like that.**life pro tip 1:** **if you want to refinance, rates are lower than ever now! shop around!**honestly, i didn't think i could find a better rate than what i had last year, but, given that interest rates are so ridiculously low right now, i figured that i'd shop around and see if i might save some money. i ran price comparisons with 10 different loan companies. each quote takes about 5 minutes and requires a ""soft check"" on your credit, so it doesn't impact your credit score until you start the actual application. i found a handful of rate quotes around 3.35% for a 7 year fixed rate refinance, and even found one as low as 3.31%! i was able to cut a 9-ish year debt at 4.09% down to a 7 year debt at 3.31% while only increasing my monthly payments by about $100. given that i was already paying an extra $100 or so over my required payment amount each month, my day-to-day expenses didn’t change but i shaved two years off my debt!that's a huge reduction on what i thought was an already low rate! over the course of my loan, that saves me about $5000 (even more if i pay down the principal early).**life pro tip 2: if you like your current loan provider, ask for a rate match**i'll start with a bit of a plug here: after years of terrible student loan providers shuffling my debt around different servicers ever year or so, i was thrilled with the quality and easy-to-use customer service by my new loan provider: sofi. i was disappointed that they didn't offer the lowest rate this time around, and i really didn't like the idea of changing to a different company that might not offer as good of service.i decided to call sofi and ask if they'd consider a rate match. i was able to speak with a loan representative in less than five minutes and negotiate a match. they offered me a 3.29% fixed interest rate, which was .02% lower than my lowest offer.all i had to do is start a new refinance application, call the customer service representative again about the rate match, and then upload a screenshot of the offer from the other company. it took a few phone calls back and forth for me to upload the correct documents, but i never had to wait for more than a minute to reach a customer service representative.**bonus life pro tip 3: before refinancing with a loan provider, try calling their customer service line to test their wait times.**i learned the hard way early on in my student loan journey that some student loan providers are a pain in the ass. i had a series of nightmares, from a loan company accidentally sending me too much money once (then demanding i send it back as a lump sum) to another company accidentally putting my loan into repayment while i was enrolled as a full-time student (this impacted my credit and i had to have my state’s attorney general’s office intervene to get all of this sorted out; it was a mess), or another loan company initially denying me a grace period when i finished college (probably because the other company put my loan into repayment when they were not supposed to), or giving me incorrect start dates for my payments-- due to confusions about the grace period laws-- then demand payment earlier than initially quoted. companies caused a few other messes, but those were the most notable. i couldn't afford a lawyer, and i'm not sure if one would have been helpful, but i ran into a huge amount of headaches caused by evil and/or incompetent loan companies looking for ways to hit me with late fees. if i were not a fastidious notetaker (thanks, grad school!), i would have been in serious trouble.probably the most frequent frustration of all was that my loans kept changing service providers with minimal notice. because i never had a clear sense of who owned my loans or whom i should call whenever i ran into problems like those above, all of this felt like a shell game. whenever i tried calling a company to ask for help, i typically had to wait 20-30 minutes on hold before speaking to a customer service representative, only to find that they had shuffled my loan off to a different company.when i was started shopping for student loan refinance companies last year, i looked at rate comparisons first, then i tried calling the customer service lines for the top two or three offers. i intentionally tried to call lines there were intended to offer support for existing loans, and not support lines catered to sales/refinancing, because i know some companies might prioritize sales and neglect existing customer support (an inverse trick i learned during the ""shell games"" i talked about earlier: if you call a company's sales line, you might reach a support person faster. sometimes, this won't save you time, since they'll transfer you to a general hold line, but sometimes a kind sales person will transfer you directly). when comparing these similar offers, i used my experiences with their customer service representatives to help me decide.i’ll add a shameless plug here: i ended up going with sofi because i never once have had to wait more than a minute on hold when trying to speak with a customer service representative. i’m relieved that they offered a rate match on my second refinance, because i’m not sure if i’d have received as good of customer service elsewhere. there are some excellent companies out there—sofi has been great for me, and i’m sure others have some great success stories, too. watch out for the bad companies though!shameless plug: i’m not paid by sofi or anything, just a happy customer. that said, if you decide to refinance with sofi, use my loan referral code and we both get $200: [sofi.com/share/1208768?src=copy](https://sofi.com/share/1208768?src=copy)&amp;#x200b;",8,3,LPT: Now Is A Great Time To Refinance Student Loans; Here Are Some Lessons I Learned,Adult

(-:it seems like the idea to downplay one's own success stories is partly a cultural thing and partly an evolutionary psychology thing.&gt;**downplaying our success stories as a cultural thing.** there were times and places in history when people believed success indicated virtue, like god approves of you the way he approved of able but not cain. so people were happy to talk about their accomplishments and i think it was something people respected instead of thinking it's obnoxious.  and then somehow it's also considered cool when rappers boast about their bling, and whatever. somehow a lot of people like trump and it seems to be specifically because he is so braggadocious.  so, it's possible talking about one's own accomplishments is not inherently offensive.  &gt;  &gt;**downplaying our success stories as an evolutionary psych thing**. people feel threatened by other people's accomplishments.  evolutionary psychologists figured out that emotions develop to help people survive.  if someone has a lot of accomplishments, it makes other people feel a negative emotion that motivates them to want to be better than that person.  talking about our successes can cause people to feel resentful and jealous, so a lot of people believe it's more virtuous to downplay our own successes and achievements.imo friends should speak clearly and accurately with each other about their accomplishments, because:1. talking about them enables us to think about them and learn from them.2. talking about them helps our friends learn from our accomplishments.3. when a person repeats the same message over and over, the familiarity causes them to start to believe it.  so it's not healthy to constantly listen to ourselves downplay our accomplishments.working class people are struggling to get ahead, and many don't succeed. being able to talk about our success stories without distorting them in order to be modest -- it might make the difference in whether or not a person achieves their biggest goals.talking about stuff is the way we think about it.  if everyone has to keep quiet about their successes, it prevents them from thinking clearly about how to succeed.*""ironically, what you really value in life is more often revealed by asking yourself who you are jealous of rather than asking yourself directly 'what do i value.'""*  (ramachandran &amp; jalal, 2017)",7,1,"LPT: Agree with a friend *not* to downplay your successes (i.e. trying to be modest) in discussion with each other.

4145,"not everyone likes to make new year’s resolutions, and that’s understandable.  but many people use the new year as a chance to make some changes in their lives, and hope that a resolution will help them do that.  the problem with most new year’s resolutions is that they are designed to fail – they are too vague, unrealistic, or easily forgettable.  making a smart goal instead of a resolution will dramatically increase your chances of success!in this post i’m going to walk you through how to make a smart goal, which will help you make real, lasting changes in your life.  some very common resolutions that can be translated to smart goals are to exercise more, eat healthier, and lose weight.  i will create a detailed smart goal for exercising more in this post, but it should be easy to apply these principles to any goal.fist, what is a smart goal?  it is a goal that is **s**pecific, **m**easureable, **a**chieveable, **r**ealistic, and **t**ime-bound.  making sure your goal has all the qualities will increase your chances of success.the goal we are going to talk about first comes from the resolution “in 2021, i’m going to exercise more!”  this is a worthy resolution, but what does it mean?  what kind of exercise?  what does “more” mean – like, how much more?? the first thing you have to do is be **specific.**  name the type of exercise that you will do.  let’s say that your goal is to walk more.  (we will assume that you are currently sedentary.) you might think, “okay, my goal is to walk 3 miles every day in 2021!”  *record scratch* - sorry, that’s not a smart goal yet. this is a smart goal:  **by june 30, 2021 i will walk an average of 40 miles per week and will complete a 5k in under 45 minutes.”realistically (that’s the **r**, remember?) you’re not going to go from a sedentary lifestyle to daily 3-mile walks overnight.  that’s setting yourself up for failure.  remember that “t” stands for time-bound.  you need to set up your goal with many time constraints to help you make progress.  you also want to make liberal use of the “m” – measurable.  being extremely specific (**s**!) in these areas is a major key to success.okay, so how exactly will you get from sedentary to walk master?  let’s start at the beginning – looking just at january.  *in january i will take a minimum of 12 walks that are at least 1 mile long.*  great!  this part of the goal is almost perfect – it is specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time bound.  but, it’s missing some information about how it will be tracked.  try this instead: **in january i will take a minimum of 12 walks that are at least 1 mile long, with no more than 2 days between each walk.  i will use map my walk to track at least 90% of my walks.**you may feel that this goal is not rigorous enough – you want to make big changes after all!  but your goal has to be **achievable** or you will get discouraged and quit.  by naming 12 walks instead of 30, you have a built-in cushion for bad weather, if you’re feeling sick, injury, etc.  it also allows you to exceed your goal, which is great motivation! the “no more than 2 days between walks” part keeps you from not taking any walks for 2 weeks and then trying to walk every day for the next two weeks.  stating that you will track your walks 90% of the times accounts for forgetting to press start, your battery dying, leaving your phone at home, etc.now let’s move on to the next step in achieving your overall goal.  you’ll need to increase your distance and your stamina. you can look at the data you collected in january to see that your average pace in was 18 minutes per mile – this will need to be improved to reach your goal of finishing a 5k in 45 minutes (15 min/mile.)   **in february i will take a minimum of 15 walks that are at least 1.75 miles long, with no more than 2 days between each walk.  i will decrease my average pace by 5%. i will use map my walk to track at least 90% of my walks.**let’s say in february you decreased your average pace per mile from 18 minutes to 17 minutes.  you’ll want to keep that up.  **in march i will take a minimum of 15 walks that are at least 2.25 miles long, with no more than 2 days between each walk.  i will decrease my average pace by 5%. i will use map my walk to track at least 90% of my walks.**by april, your average pace per mile will be 16 minutes per mile – really close to your goal!  the weather is warming up in april, and you should be able to increase your activity.  **in april i will take a minimum of 12 walks that are at least 2 miles long and 4 walks that are at least 3 miles long.  i will decrease my average pace by 3%. i will use map my walk to track at least 90% of my walks.**  by adding in a few longer walks, you are keeping your goal realistic – you may not have time to walk 3 miles on every walk, but you should have time to do it once per week.  this month’s goal decreases your average pace to 15.5 miles per minute.  almost there!**in may i will take a minimum of 8 walks that are at least 2.5 miles long and 8 walks that are 3 miles long.  i will decrease my average pace by 3%. i will use map my walk to track at least 90% of my walks. i will find a local 5k happening in june and i will register for it.**you’re in the home stretch!  **in june i will take a minimum of 6 walks that are at least 2.5 miles long and 10 walks that are 3 miles long.  i will maintain my average pace of 14.75 miles/minute.  i will use map my walk to track 90% of my walks.  i will complete a 5k in under 45 minutes.)**  and there you have it – you’ve achieved your new year’s resolution, because it was a smart goal!the beauty of smart goals is that they are so specific and incremental that they seem easy to achieve.  because you track your progress so closely, they are also easy to adjust mid-stream.  if, by april, you are blowing your goals out of the water, you can make them harder.  if you are still struggling, you can lighten them up a little.  if you are a resolution-er, try a smart goal this year!",6,1,"LPT: If you are planning to make a New Year's Resolution this year, make a SMART goal instead.

7487,"i am a deliver driver for a company that rhymes with smamaton. now some of these tips may sound like they break the rule against posting common sense tips, but as i have found in life, common sense is not very common. first tip. walk outside and see if you can quickly find and read your address. if you can’t, neither can i. did you hang a nice big beautiful wreath from that light next to the garage door? is that wreath now covering up the house number? or are you in an apartment and you hung a wreath on your door and your apartment number is now covered?finding addresses is probably my biggest waste of time. now you may say that all i need to do is see if i can read the neighbors address then i should know your address right. except that every neighborhood is different in how the numbers increase. some increase by 2, some by 4, some by 10 and even some by 20 or 50. so knowing your neighbors address doesn’t help me unless i go to your other neighbors house and see what his number is. and now i am just wasting a lot of time walking around when it would be so much easier to just have nice big visible numbers in an obvious location. here is a link to an [imgur folder](https://m.imgur.com/a/f441pmy) i put together of some of my most recent pain in the ass addresses. don’t be these people. second tip. us drivers hate porch pirates as much as you do. we do not want your stuff to get stolen. please do us a favor and put something on your porch that i can hide your package behind. big potted plants or even those big plank signs that say welcome on them work great to hide stuff behind. lately i have even seen folks buying those big plastic tubs to have their packages put in. now they obviously aren’t secure but it will lesson the chances of pirates checking out the tub just to see if something is in there. they are more interested in going for a sure thing where the big package is right there for them to see. the company i drive for also has a new delivery option where we can use our work tablet to open your garage door. to be honest, every time i do these deliveries i get worried that the homeowner will forget he had a package coming or forget that he is using this delivery option and he is going to come running into his garage blasting. but i do like the fact that it insures your stuff won’t get stolen. i have never done one of those deliveries inside a house and frankly i really don’t want to. the idea of doing it just kind of freaks me out. third tipif you have a ring door bell or something similar, please check it occasionally to make sure it works. you might need to clean the camera lens or reposition it. i have been stopped a few times by customers asking me about a package that was supposed to be delivered but is missing. (we are running 2 shifts a day and multiple drivers may end up in the same neighborhood and we don’t always deliver to the same neighborhood every day so it is a good chance it wasn’t me that delivered it) i always ask them if they have a video doorbell and most of the time i am told something about how the video looks fuzzy or is aimed in the wrong direction. it only takes a minute. double check it. fourth tipi love dogs. i keep a pocket full of milk bones to give out to all of the good pups out there. (and yes i even have a ziplock bag full of cat treats for the cats i see) when i walk up to the door and i hear a dog just giving me the “who are you” bark, i always leave a milk bone to let them know they are doing a good job. but sometimes i walk up and damn cujo is frothing at the mouth and biting at the glass next to the door, trying his hardest to break the glass so he can kill me. i don’t like those dogs. but these dogs aren’t really a problem as they can’t get to me. the real problem is when i have to head out to some farm house like today and they had 5 dogs just running around. i spent a good 5 minutes sitting in my van with side door open just talking to the dogs and tossing them milk bones. i finally thought i had them cool with me so i started walking towards the house. when i got to about 15 feet from the house, it was like someone flipped a switch and everyone started barking and growling. one then started barking and lunging towards me. fuck that. i backed up into my van, then backed the van up to the start of the driveway, tossed the package out the window, took a picture and left. my other option is to call or text you to find out what to do but you pissed me off by having mean dogs. it is not their fault, it is yours for raising them like that. so i hope they ate your package. so if you choose to have dogs roam your property with no socialization skills, then please put out a box or something that i can put stuff into with out getting eaten. final quick tipwhen you place an order with us, you have the option to add a note to the delivery. if you don’t want me to knock or ring your doorbell, put that in there. if you want the package put in a certain spot like the side of the house or behind a certain bush, put it in there. in addition, if you have put some old directions in there, double check that it is still current. i have been to this one house several times and the instructions are asking me to make sure their package gets delivered today because it is a costume and they are going to a halloween party that night. i first saw this back in august so it is over a year old. not a tip but a thank you. thank you to all of you who put out little baskets of treats for us. it is greatly appreciated. this isn’t a hard job really but it can be physically exhausting. and coming up to a house and getting a candy bar or a gatorade makes the day go by a little faster. so thank you.",340,1,"LPT: As the last week of Christmas deliveries are going to be heading out, here are some tips from your friendly neighborhood delivery driver on how to make things go faster and smoother.",Adult

15283,"an estimated 1.7 million people suffered from substance use disorder in 2017 in the united states. when i see posts about these problems on reddit, i also often see people encouraging rehabilitation and detoxification programs. research has shown that these programs frequently lead to relapse more often than medication assisted therapy (mat) and even have a chance of increasing mortality as patients will lose their tolerance during the program then use their ""standard"" dose once they get out and overdose. mat really is the gold standard for treatment but many don't know about it.&amp;#x200b;a recent clinical trial of 40 patients (i know the sample size is small) tested daily buprenorphine vs placebo for 12 months following a detox program. both groups received counseling, both group and individual. the one-year retention rate in the medication group was 75%. the one year-retention in placebo was 0%. the result was found to be statistically significant. &amp;#x200b;what is mat?the ideology behind mat is treating opioid use disorder like any other chronic medical illness such as hypertension and diabetes - with medication. the data has shown that it works and is the most effective measure we have to help those with this disorder. &amp;#x200b;tiny bit of background on how opioids work: they bind to mu receptors, mostly in your brain but there are also some in your intestines which is why opioids cause constipation. constipation is actually one of the few side effects that you will never build up tolerance to.&amp;#x200b;there are 3 main options:&amp;#x200b;1. buprenorphine (usually the first line medication): this very strongly binds to the opioid receptors but only activates them at 40% of maximum capacity. this has still shown to be enough to stop cravings. it binds stronger than heroin, oxy, etc as well so the only tricky bit is you need to be off those for about a few days before starting this otherwise it will kick the 100% drugs off the receptor and cause withdrawal symptoms which is not fun. when people don't wait long enough, sometimes they think withdrawal symptoms are actually a drug side effect and want to stop taking bup when that is not the case. there is an added benefit that due to the strong binding, it helps protect patients from overdose and helps delink using from the high because you can use a bunch of heroin on top of it and not experience that expected high. this helps decondition the learned behavior of ""do heroin, feel better.""2. methadone: methadone is a 100% agonist, just given in a controlled environment. this means that overdose is still possible. patients have to go to clinics every day to receive their medication. some people like the structure this gives their lives while others find it inconvenient. i have known patients try to switch from methadone to bup but it didn't work for them for whatever reason. that's ok!3. naltrexone: this is a long term injectable medication that is a full antagonist to the opioid receptor. you may have heard of naloxone, which is used for overdose. basically it is the same idea, just longer lasting. patients need to fully detox before using this, which has been shown to be the hardest part. if patients are able to do that, then it has shown to be as effective as the other medications in clinical trials. &amp;#x200b;why you shouldn't judge people with addiction:there is still a lot of research to be done but it has shown that some people's brains are wired differently. imagine your everyday happiness level being at 50 with 100 being the happiest possible. for many people, they can try opioids, heroin, cocaine, etc and easily can get back to that 50 as their baseline without issue. others, as soon as they use any substance once, their baseline automatically decreases to 20 or 30. they know what 50 felt like and just feel worse now all the time. these are generally the subset of people who develop a substance use disorder. &amp;#x200b;random advice:i am just a medical student - none of this is official medical advice. if you think that these medications may help you, please discuss it with a doctor. the irony is that anyone can prescribe opioids in the us but you need to complete a special 8 hour training to prescribe buprenorphine. don't just default to methadone because your doctor doesn't have the privileges to prescribe buprenorphine. bup really is first line because of that extra protection from overdose. doctors also can't prescribe methadone but they can help you get set up with a clinic to coordinate receiving treatment if you think that is the best choice for you. &amp;#x200b;i also have seen many patients try to ""detox"" from methadone/bup because they and/or their families look at it like a temporary measure. these are intended to be long-term, potentially even lifelong treatments. they are being prescribed in a safe, controlled way. don't let anyone pressure you to stop taking them as that often leads to relapse, which tends to be even more mentally destructive to patients and their families.",5,1,"LPT: If you or someone you know has opioid use disorder (includes heroin), ask about medication assisted therapy (MAT) instead of just rehab/detox/counseling programs",Adult

i’m always going on and on about the concept in the book that “each day, take one or two small baby steps towards your goal. slow, consistent progress over time.” i got that from this book.another philosophy of mine also comes from this book. “shut up and actually take action; stop sitting around overthinking things. stop trying to be perfect and instead just start, and accept the fact you’ll suck for a while. you’ll naturally improve over time.”i’ve used the slight edge to achieve almost all of the big goals in my life, and countless smaller goals as well.* i completed a 365 project where i took a photo a day for an entire year, without missing a single day.* lost 35 kg by taking it one day at a time.* built my main website and wrote 150+ articles* built a coaching/counselling business so i could quit my regular job and be financially-independent.* went from being a weakling in the gym to rack-pulling 200kg (441lbs).* paid off $10,000 in debt by just chipping away at it, a bit at a time.* overcame my social-phobia and started making friends by pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone each day.* fixed my dating life by just talking to one girl a day out in public.* a tonne of smaller goals the book has helped me with. things like:* paying off other debts.* building my social circle.* getting a promotion at my old job.* setting challenges &amp; achieved them such as writing 33 articles in 21 days (over on my main site), writing 5 articles in 10 hours, etc.* writing a 130,000-word series on my main site (that’s longer than most novels.)* forcing myself to do things i was terrified to do by using techniques from the book. eg i got a tattoo (i’d procrastinated that for years), moved in order to chase my dreams, got a vasectomy, etc.* changing my diet and cutting out junk food.* quitting addictions (alcohol, pornography, video games and sugary food).my girlfriend has used it to achieve a tonne of her goals too.* she used it to get an internship with absolutely zero experience in the field.* she lost 10kg.* started her own art business.* overcame an eating disorder (bulimia).* talked to 15 random strangers on the street (goal was she had to have at least a 5 minute conversation with each one).* learned to do the splits.* deadlifted 100kg.* moved out of home and became independent.* did 1 piece of artwork a day.* a tonne of other, smaller goals.most of my coaching clients, as well as a number of my friends, use the principles from the book to achieve their goals too.the slight edge helps you be way more organised with your goals/life, and be way more committed to getting the things you want. i read the book at least once a year, and so does my girlfriend. it’s extremely motivating and feel-good, as well as very practical. it’s perfect for getting you back on track if you’ve been a bit lazy lately… or if you’re embarking on your first big self-improvement mission.there are some gaps in the slight edge book – some areas i feel are a little short. this guide is my spin on the slight edge – i’ve modified it a lot to add in everything i’ve learned over the years from using it and reaching my own goals. don’t get me wrong – the slight edge is an amazing book. we’re just going to make it even better 😉# 1.2 – key concepts from the bookas i said above, i’ve made a few modifications to the slight edge formula. here’s the core concepts from the book + my own additions:* work on your goals every day – aim to take one tiny little baby step towards your goals each day. even on your worst, most horrible day, you should still do something – even if it’s something pathetically small and seemingly-insignificant. it all adds up.* don’t spend months trying to come up with a “perfect” plan, or “researching”, or “educating yourself” – just give yourself permission to suck and dive right in. take action, right now. you’ll be able to tweak and adjust your plan once you start anyway.* have 1 or 2 main goals you pour most of your time and energy into. you can add a couple of extra “mini-goals” at the same time; but they shouldn’t interfere with your main 1 or 2 goals.* goals need to be tangible, realistic, achievable, and meaningful to you.* set deadlines for your goals. those deadlines also need to be realistic. you’ll never be successful without the time-pressure of a looming deadline to push yourself; especially during your lazy days/weeks.* go all-in. do whatever it takes to reach your goals by the deadlines you’ve set.* reaching your goals requires sacrifices; you have to be willing to give things up. maybe that’s giving up your bad habits, or giving up the things that make you lazy/complacent, or giving up time-wasting activities. sometimes you have to say no to things to free up time/energy to work on your goals.the core message of the book, and my own philosophy is this:**every day is either a step forward, or a step back.** you’re either on the path heading towards success, or on the path away from success.small habits matter, because they add up over time. eg: let’s say you have a day where you’re craving junk food like crazy. you decide, “screw it” and you go eat mcdonalds for lunch, instead of something healthy. in that one instance it won’t matter too much – it’s just 1 mcdonalds meal. but by taking the lazy path in that one moment, you’re opening the door for building a habit of regularly choosing junk food in the future. each time you make the “bad choice”, you’re building a habit of straying from your goals. you’re ensuring it’ll be easier to make bad choices again in the future.if instead you decide “ok, i’ll go eat something healthy instead” – in the moment it won’t matter all that much. nobody loses all their bodyfat with just 1 healthy meal. but by choosing the healthy choice, you’re building a habit of working towards your goals. you’re making it easier to make good choices again in the future.good choices add up over time.tiny little baby steps add up over time.# 1.3 – extra benefits of the slight edgean important part of the slight edge is setting clear deadlines for your goals, and doing everything it takes to achieve those goals on time. once you build a habit of always achieving your goals before the deadline is up, you’ll start to believe, “ok. i can literally do anything i set my mind to, as long as i’m patient and willing to keep working on it, a little bit every day.”you’ll be able to set a goal and give yourself, say, 3 months to complete it. you’ll know at the end of those 3 months, you’ll have achieved the goal. this is revolutionary because it gives you a timeline for your life. you’ll be able to look at your calendar, look at the goals you’ve set, and start planning out, “ok, in 3 months i’ll have achieved this goal. then i can start working on this other goal i have. that goal will probably take me…. 5 months? after that, it’ll be december, so then i’ll start working on this next goal here. that one will take me about 9 months, so i’ll have it done by august next year.” you’ll be able to map out the next 12 months or so of your life, and you’ll know exactly where you’ll be at the end of it.it’s exciting because you get to fantasise about what you want, what you want to achieve, what things would be really cool to have – and then actually go and make them happen. self-improvement is supposed to be really fun and exciting – you literally get to have anything you want (as long as you’re willing to work for it). it’s like being a little kid again; there are no limits, only your own imagination.if you don’t have any goals, or deadlines, or a map of how you want your next 12 months to go, it can be easy to feel lost. a lot of people feel this way because they don’t have a timeline in front of them – it’s all kind of wishy-washy, like they’re looking out to sea with have no idea what’s out there. they might have some goals they want to work on, some things they want to achieve – but because they haven’t set deadlines for those goals, they’re just sorta staring out into the void, with no idea when those goals will happen (if ever?) they’re essentially letting out a big sigh and saying, “hmmm, i hope this all works out.”the slight edge puts the power back in your hands – you’re now assertive and taking charge. you’re not longer just a passive passenger in your own life, with goals “hopefully” working out on their own, as if by magic/luck (life doesn’t work that way). now you get to actually take the steps towards your goals – just a little baby step each day. now you actually get to make your goals happen, instead of just wishing for them.knowing the goals you’re working on also makes it really fun when someone says to you, “hey how’s your life going?” or “tell me more about yourself?” you’ll get really excited, because you’re on a mission . you’ll say, excitedly, “ok so right now i’m working on losing 5kg of fat, i’m learning to rock climb with the goal being to go climbing in this mountain range a few hours from my house. then i’m going to start my own website; the goal is to publish my first article by the end of april. oh and i’m working extra shifts at work because i’m saving up to buy myself a new computer. in may i’m going to start learning a bit of carpentry with my buddy, because i’ve always wanted to learn that.”everybody else talks about doing cool things with their life. you’ll actually be doing cool things with your life. other people are passive; they’re sit around talking about the life they want to live someday. you’re actually living it.you’ll also find yourself feeling more confident in what you want – you’ve written it down, set a deadline, you know you’re going to get there with a little work each day. your goals will be solidified, and you’ll take them seriously.you’ll find achieving your first couple of slight edge goals imbues you with a confidence, a sense of self that’s unmatched by anything else.# 1.4 – where to buy the bookyou need to buy the book and read it before you continue with this guide. the book is required reading in order to get the most out everything i’m going to say – especially when it comes to goals.it’s a very easy read – you can read it all in one sitting. it’s so well written and fun to read that it’s almost like a motivational book (but obviously the point of the book is to take action, not just read yet another self-help book.)# part 2 – setting goals2.1 – how to come up with your goals; dream bigthink about what you ultimately want. and i don’t just mean goals you think are attainable for you right now – i want you to dream big. let your mind fantasise and come up with the wildest goals you can think of – even if they’re goals that make you think, “i could never do that.” even if they’re goals that would take several years to achieve. even if they’re goals that seem like a pipe dream – completely impossible. i’ve achieved a bunch of things that at one point felt utterly impossible to me.if you’re struggling to come up with goals you want to work on, go sit in a quiet park somewhere or sit in your room and ask yourself this question:**what do i want?**it might take you a few minutes, or hours, or even days to really decide what you want. that’s ok; just keep asking yourself, “what do i want?” and eventually something will come up. deep down you know what you really want; just give yourself permission to admit you want it, even if you think it’s too far-fetched or too impossible. nothing’s impossible, but you have to admit you want it first.when i first started teaching my girlfriend the slight edge philosophy, and she achieved her first few goals, it blew her mind that she was actually allowed to have the things she wanted. she was astounded to learn that if you just work for it, you truly can have whatever you want. i jokingly told her, “you can even get to the moon if you want to, as long as you take a baby step towards it every single day.”once you’ve come up with the goals you really want, write them all down on a piece of paper or in an online note-keeping app (i use evernote). again, don’t stress if the things you want seem unattainable – every single big goal i’ve ever achieved seemed impossible to me before i started working on it. we’ll break down the goals into smaller, more manageable steps anyway.it’s important your goals are things you get really excited about; things you care about deeply and will be motivated to work on. you’re going to have times where your goals are hard, you’re going to have days where you have very little willpower or energy or motivation. if the goals you chose aren’t really all that meaningful to you, it’ll be easier to give up/quit on your bad days. so make sure the goals you set are ones you desperately want; then you’ll never quit.we’re trying to make your life awesome; not just set arbitrary goals that have you spinning your wheels for no real benefit.when you’ve written all your goals down in a big list, you’ll probably feel like there’s a lot; maybe too many goals. that’s perfectly normal; you don’t have to work on all of them at once. don’t get overwhelmed by how many things you want to change; we’ll be tackling them a couple at a time. keep all of your goals in that notebook/note-keeping app, and tell yourself it’s ok to postpone some of them while you work on a couple of goals at a time.the other goals aren’t going anywhere. you’ve got an entire lifetime to work on yourself, so don’t stress.the question i get asked the most is: should i focus on dating first, or career first? my answer is always dating first; for a million reasons i’ve covered in articles on my main site. go 100% all-in with your dating life, give it everything you’ve got for a few years, and tell yourself you’ll work on your career/finances once you’ve handled the dating phase of your life.i’ve got my own huge list of goals i want to achieve – there’s over 100 things on it at this point. i don’t let myself get overwhelmed by how many things i still need to do; i just work on a couple of them at a time, and remind myself, “i have the rest of my life to do everything. no point stressing and worrying about “running out of time.”# 2.2 – “i will”, not “i want to”you need to phrase your goals as “i will do this” – implying you will be successful. really, i’m referring to going all-in, and taking your goals seriously. do not say, “i want this goal” or “it’d be really nice to have this goal” or the worst of them all; “i wish i could have this goal”.when you use passive language like “i want” or “i wish”, you’re telling yourself it’s just a pipe dream; something you’ll never really have. it’s why you hear people who’ve been fat for years say things like, “i want to be thin” or “i’d really like to be thin”, instead of, “i will be thin”.instead, tell yourself you are going to be successful.“i will get to 70kg by jan 20th”.“i will make $100,000 through my business.”“i will benchpress 120kg.”take charge and decide you will achieve your goals.when you make a goal, you have to sign a metaphorical-contract with yourself that you will not fail it. tell yourself you will be successful, no matter what.my mindset has always been, “if i don’t do this, i have to kill myself. failure is not an option.” yep, i literally frame my goals as “do or die”, “sink or swim”. i’m not saying you need to consider suicide – but i can’t deny that all-or-nothing mentality has been probably the biggest reason i’ve been so successful. as soon as you say to yourself, “i will succeed at this, no matter how long it takes, or how many times i fail” – you’re guaranteeing your own success. i’ll talk more about never quitting below.you have to give yourself permission to do whatever it takes to be successful. go all-in.# 2.3 – make your goals tangible, positive &amp; achievable, with a finish linethe goals you set have to be:**tangible:** as in, a concrete number/value. not, “i will get thin by december 12th” – how will you know when you’ve achieved that? and what is “thin”? 80kg? 75kg? 70kg? you need to use an actual, tangible metric. a better goal would be, “i will get to 70kg by december 12th.”another example: “i will get more muscular by feb 2nd” is not a tangible goal. instead, rewrite it with an actual metric: “i will get my weight up to 80kg by feb 2nd” or “i’ll benchpress 100kg by feb 2nd”.***positive:*** frame your goals as a positive thing you will achieve, rather than a negative thing you’ll stop doing. for instance, “i will quit smoking by december 12th” is a negative-framing, and all you’re going to do is burn through your willpower, sitting around thinking about the thing you’re not allowed to do. not doing something isn’t the end-goal; it’s a stepping-stone to achieving the actual goal you want. yes, quit smoking – but frame your goal as something positive you’re going to do instead of the negative habit.it would be better framed as, “i will run at 10km/hr pace for 10 minutes on the treadmill, by december 12th.” that’s a positive goal that will probably require you to quit smoking in order to achieve it; awesome. now you have something positive to run towards, rather than just a negative habit to run away from (with nothing positive to replace it with).another example: “i will stop pussying out with women by january 19th” is not a positive goal. reframe it as a positive goal: “i will hit on 100 girls by january 19th”.people get stuck in downward spirals because they only focus on the negative – “i’m really unhappy with where i am right now” – but they don’t then turn that into anything positive. sitting in that cycle of self-loathing will only cause you to become helpless and hopeless; you’ll have all these insecurities and negative feelings, with no way to change anything.frame your goals in a positive manner instead.***deadline:*** your goals must also have a realistic and achievable deadline. we’ll cover deadlines in detail below.***achievable*****:** the goals you set need to be achievable. if you set an unrealistic goal, you likely won’t achieve it – which leads to frustration, disappointment and self-loathing. if you repeat this and set multiple goals you can’t finish on time, you may start to believe you’re not capable of achieving any goals – a horrific habit to build.instead, break those massive goals down into smaller goals. if you want to earn 1 million dollars, break that down into a smaller goal – “i’ll earn $2000 from a new business i start, by june 26.” once you achieve that goal, you can then set a new target (eg $5,000), and then another new target, and a new one after that – eventually working your way up to 1 million.***finish line:*** your goals also need to have an end-point; they can’t be daily habits. by that i mean you should write your goal as a tangible destination; rather than some habit you repeat. so don’t say, “i will walk every day for 10 minutes”. you’re inevitably going to have bad days where you don’t do any walking, and then what – you’ve failed your goal entirely?instead, write your goal as an end-point you can get to. eg: “i will walk a quarter-marathon (6.5 miles) by march 20th.”goal setting only works if you have an end goal; a destination to work towards with a deadline to keep you on track. daily habits help you achieve that goal; but they’re not a goal in and of themselves.# 2.4 – deadlines are key; make sure they’re realistic and achievabledeadlines are the most important part of achieving your goals; nothing lights a fire under your ass like only having a week or two left to complete your goal. you’ll often find the pareto principle applies here – you’ll do 80% of the work in the last 20% of the weeks you’ve given yourself.it’s very important you set very lenient deadlines – deadlines that give you enough time to absolutely reach your goal on time. always allow for extra time in case something goes wrong. for example, for strength goals i’ve set myself in the gym, i set a deadline – say, 3 months from now. then i’ll allow for something going wrong: “what would happen if i hurt my leg or something and need to take 3 weeks off?” i then add an extra 3 weeks to my deadline, to allow for unforeseen consequences. so even if life throws me a curveball, i know i’ll still hit my goal on time.remember, you can always bust your ass and reach your goal early. i’m not saying to slack off and be lazy for those extra 3 weeks. they’re only there as a safety net, incase something pops up you hadn’t accounted for (which happens probably 90% of the time, especially with longterm goals).it’s very important you set realistic and attainable deadlines, and make it your mission to get a few successes under your belt. your first few goals should be extremely easy and doable – start small. being successful with your first couple of easy goals helps you gain traction. once you have a taste of success and achieving a goal – even a small one – you’ll be hungry for more. your success will snowball. you won’t want to stop.over enough time, and with achieving enough goals, you you’ll start to feel like a successful person. achieving your goals will be the norm, not the exception. you’ll start feeling like you can do absolutely anything you want. you can even get to the moon, if you want to. 😉i know it can be tempting to give yourself very short deadlines when you’re first starting out with self-improvement. you’re acutely aware of all the things you want to change, and you feel like you can’t afford to waste any time. i get that.but trust me, speaking from my own experience and the experience of countless clients of mine, it is better to set realistic deadlines you can actually achieve, so you can build a habit of completing your goals. there’s nothing worse than setting 5 goals with very short deadlines, missing all of them, and feeling like a complete failure. i’ve seen too many people throw in the towel and quit because they screwed themselves with unrealistic deadlines. don’t be one of them. you’re smarter than that.it’s more important to be able to teach yourself: “i set very easy and achievable goals. some of them are stupidly easy and maybe i could have pushed myself more, but at least i can say i achieve 100% of all the goals i ever set. once i set a goal, it’s basically guaranteed i will achieve it.“keep your deadlines realistic and attainable – and allow a little extra time to account for the unexpected.# 2.5 – 1 (or 2) main goals you obsess aboutone question i get asked all the time is: “which is better: having 1 or 2 main goals i really obsess about… or spreading myself out a bit and working on 10 little goals at once?”my answer is always: pick 1 or 2 main goals you obsess over, and pour 99% of your energy into them. you can then add a couple of really small goals you work on in the background; but your main 1 or 2 goals will always need to take priority. almost everything worth having requires you to go all-in and give it everything you’ve got; there’s no point spreading yourself thin and half-assing 10 goals. you’ll just end up “jack of all trades; master of none.”as i said earlier, when choosing which 1 or 2 main goals you’ll prioritise, you really need to be ok with “neglecting” some of your other goals a bit. you really have to give the vast majority of your time and attention to your 1 or 2 main goals. write the other goals down in a notebook/note-keeping app, and tell yourself you’ll come back to them after you complete your main 1 or 2 goals first.sometimes it won’t be clear to you which goal you should prioritise. maybe you want to start working on your dating life, but you’re 50lbs overweight and not sure if you should lose fat first, or start talking to girls first. different people will give you different advice (my advice is always to lose a lot of the fat as your main goal, while also starting to talk to girls as a minor, secondary goal). generally speaking, it doesn’t matter too much which goal you work on first. you have plenty of time to handle all your goals – so don’t stress about getting the order perfect. just start working on a goal – any goal – right now.when setting the deadline(s) for your 1 or 2 main goal(s), really sit down and plan it out. you might need to do a day or two of research (but don’t waste weeks researching – taking action is more important than spending weeks researching). research how long other people have taken to achieve similar goals. research what might go wrong; what pitfalls those people had. think about whether there’s any extenuating circumstances that might slow your progress compared to other people – or any circumstances that might speed it up.once you’ve figured out how long you’ll need to complete the goal, add extra time onto it to account for the unpredictable nature of this thing we call life. generally speaking, i like to add 20% extra time just to be safe. (remember, you’re allowed to complete your goal early – in fact, it feels really bloody good to do so.)i personally like to set big goals that will take 6-12 months to achieve, but you can pick shorter or slightly longer goals if you like. i wouldn’t go too far over 12 months; that’s usually too far into the future that it’s hard to stay motivated and enthusiastic for that long. if you have a goal that’ll take over a year to complete, just break it down into a shorter goal. eg if your goal is to lose 50kg, break it down to: “i will lose 25kg in 30 weeks.”your mindset with your main 1 or 2 goals needs to be: i will do whatever it takes to succeed. this will usually mean becoming absolutely obsessed with it. spend every spare second you have obsessing about it, focusing on it. for example, if your goal is to lose 25kg in 30 weeks:every time you have some spare time, read through every fat-loss and exercise site/forum you can find.* listen to fat-loss podcasts/audiobooks on the way to work.* during your lunch break at work, read every article on aworkoutroutine.* when you finish work, go for a 30 minute walk – even if you’re tired.* after dinner, spend the evening learning about calorie-counting, about macros and protein and carbs and fat, etc.* before you go to bed, post on a fat-loss forum to keep yourself accountable.* then go to bed and dream about losing fat.* wake up tomorrow and repeat the obsession.sidenote: you can still work on your other smaller goals – they’ll just be extra tasks you do when you have some free time. you’ll be making small amounts of progress towards them, so it’s not like you’re completely neglecting them or ignoring them; they’re just not your absolute main mission right now. you won’t be obsessed with them like you will with your main 1 or 2 goals.obsessing about your goals is the best way to get shit done and live an awesome life. forget all the nonsense people spout about “moderation”. that’s normie-talk. normies have no fucking clue how good it feels to wake up every day and go for what you truly want in life. they have no idea how good it feels to be taking baby steps towards their goals every day. normies have no clue what it means to feel alive.when you set goals and start working towards them, you’ll wake up each day with a purpose, knowing you’re on a mission, knowing you get to have absolutely anything you want – as long as you’re willing to work for it. you’ll know you’re working towards things you truly care about.without a doubt, the reason i’ve been successful with all my big goals is because i’ve always become obsessed with them. i think about them 16 hours a day, from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed, and every spare second in between. it’s my unwavering obsession which has lead to my success.you will have to make some sacrifices along the way – you’ll have to give up some of your vices. you’ll have to say no to certain things. you’ll have to put your goals first and prioritise them, and sometimes that’ll mean saying no to things like going \`clubbing on a friday night and getting completely drunk. sometimes you’ll have to be the nerd who goes home at 10pm to get an early night, so he’s fresh for the gym the next morning.you’ll also have to give up your complacency – no more coming home from work each day and playing video games for 4 hours before going to bed. no more lazing around on the couch all weekend watching netflix. no more wasting all your money on throwaway stuff you don’t really need. to some degree, you’ll have to grow up and start being responsible – and you’ll definitely have to start taking yourself seriously.i never said success was easy; only that it’s inevitable if you’re willing to work for it. if it was easy, everybody would be successful. big dreams require big sacrifices.# 2.6 – and then set a couple of smaller, easier mini-goalsonce you’ve set your main 1 or 2 goals and have chosen realistic deadlines (if they’re not realistic, go back and change them now), you can add an extra couple of small goals if you want to. i call these “mini-goals”.let me make this really clear: your mini-goals must absolutely not interfere with your main 1 or 2 goals. they can’t be big things like losing 15kg or talking to 200 girls or starting a business. they have to be super small, super easy things like, “i’ll spring clean my kitchen” or “i’ll update my resume” or “i’ll go to 2 meetups“. you want them to be so stupidly easy you’re almost guaranteed to do them.and when setting the deadline for your mini-goals, give yourself plenty of time to do them; don’t pressure yourself with a short deadline. because remember, your main 1 or 2 goals need to take priority above all else. you don’t want to pile on extra stress from your mini-goals. they’re supposed to be nice little “bonuses” that only take a couple days to complete. the idea is you work on them whenever you have a spare hour or so here and there.make sure it’s only a couple of mini-goals at once; don’t go overboard. 3 mini-goals at the most (on top of your 1 or 2 main goals). i like to use these mini-goals as a great way to finally complete stuff i’ve been procrastinating for ages and putting off. here’s some of the mini-goals i’ve set in the past:* cleaning out the fridge, washing all the racks, making it look brand new. deadline: 2 weeks.* sending 10 people a copy of my resume and seeing if anyone is hiring. deadline: 2 months.* add 5kg to my deadlift. deadline: 2 months.* taking 3 new photos for my online dating accounts. deadline: 6 weeks.* attending 5 new meetups. deadline: 3 months.* reading a book from start to finish. deadline: 1 month.* listening to 5 self-help podcasts. deadline: 2 months.* doing 10 pullups in a row. deadline: 3 months.* sell my old books. deadline: 3 months.* buy 2 new outfits. deadline: 4 weeks.as you can see, those mini-goals were really easy so they didn’t get in the way of my main 2 goals. i gave myself really long deadlines – sometimes as much as a few months, even though most of them only took a few hours to complete. and that’s the point. they’re supposed to be really easy mini-goals you work on in the background, while focusing your attention on your main 1 or 2 goals.don’t overwhelm yourself by taking on too much. it’s better to take on too little, and finish all your goals early. then, you can just immediately set some new goals. there’s no punishment for finishing all your goals early, but there’s some very huge negatives to missing your deadlines.you want your mini-goals to be automatic victories to get you into the habit of setting a goal, setting a deadline, doing a tiny bit each day to work towards it, then hitting your goal on or before your deadline. you want success to become a habit; something you always achieve. setting easy mini-goals with long deadlines guarantees that.# 2.7 – write your goals somewhere you’ll see them every day (calendar reminders)it’s important you display your goals (and their deadlines) somewhere prominent – somewhere you’ll see them every day (or even better, multiple times a day).some people like to write their goals on a big whiteboard in their living room.other people write them as sticky notes on their bathroom mirror.i stick my goals on my phone desktop (as a widget), so they’re right in my face every single time i open up my phone.i use the phone widget app called countdown widget to display the number of days left on each goal:every time i pull out my phone, this is staring me right in the face.i also add my goals to my google calendar, and i add reminders to go off when the deadlines are getting close. i like to set multiple reminders for my big important goals (the 1 or 2 main goals):– 3 weeks before the deadline.– 2 weeks before the deadline.– 1 week before the deadline.– 2 days before the deadline.whatever method(s) you go with, make sure your goals are always on your mind – you want to be obsessing about them every single day. particularly your 1 or 2 main goals.that’s it – that’s the secret to success. nothing else matters;

193,"i've seen a few posts about adrs recently talking about how all chinese stocks (nio baba tencent) are based in the cayman islands and no one's really buying stock in these chinese companies and that china has no need to uphold these agreements - as a disclaimer, before i go on, i was to say i do own stock in nio and baba as well as amzn, aapl and a few other small ai companies.while many of you may be technically correct about adrs, it fundamentally ignores the foreign policy climate of almost all countries and more specifically ignores the way china's foreign policy is being conducted right now - i'm not an expert and you should of course do your own dd but what i've noticed from all these posts is that they are all ignoring the idea of soft power.**lets define what soft and hard power are**: i've taken these definitions from wikipedia, because they're concise and as always wikipedia is well referenced (damn teachers!)soft power: in politics (and particularly in international politics), soft power is the ability to attract and co-opt, rather than coerce (contrast hard power). in other words, soft power involves shaping the preferences of others through appeal and attraction - foreign aid is an excellent example of the use of soft powerhard power: hard power is the use of military and economic means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. this form of political power is often aggressive (coercion), and is most immediately effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power**why is this important?:**while china is on its way to becoming a global superpower its not there yet, there are more economically reliable countries (us) and countries with more functional military might (russia and us) - i say functional here because military might isn't just man power and number of soldiers.china uses hard power when it comes to domestic policy, through the use of censorship, coercion of officials, imprisonment of dissidents and so on and so forth.

now china doesn't want that to happen and to ensure it doesn't, it's followed an interesting hybridisation of communism and capitalism where private companies are closely linked to the government but are allowed to compete and have private ownership. however this has meant that chinese companies and by extension china as a country has to be attractive to outside investors and that's where soft power comes in.throughout the pandemic and even before china has been trying to expand its soft power further in the hope of eventually leveraging itself into the world's leading super power. case and point is the free trade agreement it signed with 14 other asia-pacific countries creating an even larger free market than the eu (16% vs 22%) ([https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/15/china-and-14-asia-pacific-countries-agree-historic-free-trade-deal)). while this gives it more economic power, it also gives china great headlines!this isn't the only way china is trying to garner a better image of itself and therefore more soft power - for a long time, china has been and is commonly viewed as one of the largest polluters in the world ([https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:\~:text=the%20people's%20republic%20of%20china,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy](https://ge.usembassy.gov/chinas-air-pollution-harms-its-citizens-and-the-world/#:~:text=the%20people's%20republic%20of%20china,health%20and%20the%20world's%20economy).), pollution that has been killing around a million of its citizens a year - so to not only improve their citizens lives (though how much of the main motivation that is i'm very skeptical) but to also capture the ongoing trend of renewable energy becoming the dominant energy market in the next decade or two, china has been pouring money into clean energy initiatives, so they not only capture a significant slice of an upcoming dominant market but they are also able to position themselves as the clean energy capital of the world.let's be clear though, the current pandemic has affected their soft power and reduced it massively which leads onto the crux of my argument.**how soft power relates to adrs and stocks?**for china to successfully follow through with their plans (leveraging soft power into economic might - the tried and tested american way to an extent - except america had ww2 and the marshall plan to reach this point sidenote: i know that's massively reductive and there's a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i.e. nuclear bombs and military might) they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power. so how does this relate the adrs:if china and chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies, it would lead to major banks, hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy - a counterpoint i can imagine in the comments may be that it's technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn't state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are. every major newspaper would be covering it, people who have invested would be using their soft power (their vote) to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese adrs. i know i wouldn't be buying anything from china again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government. they are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economydisinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent i would agree it may be but the most recent example is baba stock - the disappearance of jack ma not only lead to a massive drop in baba stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in chinese companies - and while i'm sure jack ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality, the chinese government will have also realised that they'll need to adapt to ensure that they don't lose the soft power they've spent over 40 years cultivating ( look up deng xiaoping's china reform and opening-up policy).and to address comments that i'm sure will say china can be self sufficient without any foreign investments - i'm sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries, the primary example being the ussr and a less prominent example being north korea. the chinese government is ruthless, efficient and they're certainly not stupid.of course if anyone thinks i'm wrong, please let me know - i also understand that the baba example is more nuanced than how far i've gone into it because of jack ma's ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands.**tldr: china would lose their soft power, banks and people would disinvest in china if they didn't honor their adr agreements and would set china onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval - i could be wrong though**edit: hong kong is an interesting counterpoint to my argument, but i would say that to a certain extent, banks knew hk would be bought under the ccp and still think they can make money there - also hong kong massively damaged chinese soft power and if there had been a better president i think the effect would have been huge but there wasn't and the markets are over it - if adrs aren't honoured, then banks and hedge funds would lose money and i think that that's their bottom line and a red line for them -

the tried and tested american way to an extent - except america had ww2 and the marshall plan to reach this point sidenote: i know that's massively reductive and there's a lot of other factors involved in america becoming a superpower including a shit load of hard power i.e. nuclear bombs and military might) they require investment not just from domestic sources but foreign sources otherwise they gain no soft power. so how does this relate the adrs:if china and chinese companies were to renege on their agreements with these shell companies, it would lead to major banks, hedge funds and entire countries to disinvest from the chinese economy - a counterpoint i can imagine in the comments may be that it's technically not a reneging because the these chinese companies and chinese law doesn't state that you can own shares but the optics of it certainly are. every major newspaper would be covering it, people who have invested would be using their soft power (their vote) to push for harder line on china and so would banks who would be disinvesting by their droves from chinese adrs. i know i wouldn't be buying anything from china again because the risk is too high and that would be the most dangerous thing for the chinese government. they are trying and have until now succeeded in creating an image of a stable thriving economydisinvestment may sound sensationalist and to an extent i would agree it may be but the most recent example is baba stock - the disappearance of jack ma not only lead to a massive drop in baba stock but countless headlines about how dangerous it is to invest in chinese companies - and while i'm sure jack ma when he returns will have to change to adapt to his potentially curbed reality, the chinese government will have also realised that they'll need to adapt to ensure that they don't lose the soft power they've spent over 40 years cultivating ( look up deng xiaoping's china reform and opening-up policy).and to address comments that i'm sure will say china can be self sufficient without any foreign investments - i'm sure they can but that path has until now lead to ruin for other countries, the primary example being the ussr and a less prominent example being north korea. the chinese government is ruthless, efficient and they're certainly not stupid.of course if anyone thinks i'm wrong, please let me know - i also understand that the baba example is more nuanced than how far i've gone into it because of jack ma's ant group going onto central bank turf but the logic behind the point stands.**tldr: china would lose their soft power, banks and people would disinvest in china if they didn't honor their adr agreements and would set china onto the path of future economic ruin and upheaval - i could be wrong though**",5,1,ADRs and China,Finance
796,"this is a thread to discuss taleb’s barbell investing idea, introduced in chapter 13 of “the black swan.”i’m   going to quote taleb’s description of the strategy here, which i    believe is ok because he blatantly and purposefully makes all his  books   freely available via online pdf.*“if  you know that you are  vulnerable to prediction errors, and  if you  accept that most “risk  measures” are flawed, because of the  black swan,  then your strategy is  to be as hyperconservative*  *and   hyperaggressive as you can be instead  of being mildly aggressive or   conservative. instead of putting your  money in “medium risk”   investments (how do you know it is medium risk?  by listening to   tenure-seeking “experts”?), you need to put a portion,  say 85 to 90   percent, in extremely safe instruments, like treasury  bills—as safe a   class of instruments as you can manage to find on this  planet. the   remaining 10 to 15 percent you put in extremely speculative  bets, as   leveraged as possible (like options), preferably venture  capital-style   portfolios. that way you do not depend on errors of risk  management;  no  black swan can hurt you at all, beyond your “floor,” the  nest egg  that  you have in maximally safe investments.”*this  is  in no way a suggestion that any of us should invest in a  strategy  like  this. this is a thread to discuss specific, practical,   hypothetical  components that an investor in this type of strategy could   use to  construct their barbell.personally, i’m more interested in publicly traded investments than private equity.i don’t have many ideas to share, but here are a few.**positive black swans**bitcoin   – tbh i just sold all of my bitcoin. but i still think of  this as an   area with possibly unlimited upside. i also \*like\* the idea  of others   piling into the trade using stocks like riot and bidding up  the price of   blockchain-related etps way above nav. the next time we  see a slew of   “i-told-you-so” bitcoin articles about all those silly  tulip chasers,   i’ll be levering up through instruments like these  rather than buying   btc itself, since i’m not a believer anyway. are  there any ways to get   direct leveraged exposure to btc?call  options – i am an  options noob recently trying to educate  myself. my  problem with call  options is that when they are most useful  (after big  market declines),  they are also most expensive. if this is  a  misconception, i would like  to clear it up. can anyone recommend  good  resources to learn options  trading? i’m not sure if i should take  a  class at my local business  school, read some books (which ones?),  learn  through websites (which  ones?), or all of the above.hedge  fund copycat – just last  year i put a small amount into gold  mining  penny stocks highlighted on a  series of yt videos by crescat  capital. i  don’t really believe any of  their story, but i think the  fact that  they are telling it increases the  probability of these penny  stocks  doing well. one of them is up over  600% since i bought so  that’s cool. i  haven’t used this strategy with  anything else. anyone  else have ideas  for this strategy?how else can we get exposure to positive black swans in our barbell strategy?**negative black swans**usd   – usd losing its status as world reserve currency would be a   tremendous  black swan. at first thought, it seems like there are lots   of direct  leveraged trades to short usd via the forex exchange (e.g.   just go long  eurusd). but on second thought, if all currencies lose   against whatever  the new reserve currency will be, then it may not be   quite so easy to  pick relative winners among the losers. what else can   we do to get  exposure to this event in a barbell?put  options – again,  total noob options trader here. i love the  irony of  puts in that they  are cheapest when they are most useful and  valuable.  how beautiful is  that. i get the math behind simple hedging  strategies  using spx puts,  but what if you want to seek greater  profits in your  barbell? how do you  identify a real turd to maximize  the potential  payout of your puts? i  know, that’s a big question. any  books (or  anything else?) that you  would recommend on the subject? i  know that’s  like asking the industry of short sellers to reveal their  secrets, but  hey it doesn’t hurt to ask.what other strategies should we stick on the negative side of our barbell? and how?",18,1,Barbell Investing,Finance

[https://geniussports.com/home/partners/](https://geniussports.com/home/partners/)&amp;#x200b;genius is above other spacs due to its mature market position and strong financials. the company has been growing at a 30% cagr over the last several years, with revenue growing 250% from 2016 to 2020 ($42m to $145m). 60% of revenue is recurring due to multi year contracts, and the top 10 customers only account for 30% of revenue, thus lowering flight risk of any particular customer. genius is already ebitda positive with 10% margins this year, and anticipates $68m in adjusted ebitda (adjusted to ignore stock based compensation, a non-cash expense) with 29% margins in two years. &amp;#x200b;in a year where sports were disrupted by covid, genius still grew revenue from $116m to $145m. they also successfully resigned their contract with the nba, ensuring a multi-year partnership with the premiere us basketball league. outside of the betting market, genius’s ability to aggregate data has led to an interesting agreement with the ncaa. until 2018, live data with college sports was incredibly inefficient. genius signed a contract with the ncaa to create a new software: ncaa livestats [https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/](https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/). this is a uniform software for all divisions of college sports. as a former college athlete myself, i reached out to some of the athletic support staff from my university. they raved about how genius has improved efficiency and accuracy for college athletics. ncaa livestats has overhauled the entire industry.&amp;#x200b;i also think the ncaa presents the biggest upside catalyst for genius: march madness. march madness was cancelled due to the pandemic last year, but betters placed $4.8b in bets on the tournament in 2019. who has a monopoly on ncaa data? genius. who gets a 5% revenue share from all sports books for ncaa events? genius. with the number of states with legalized betting doubling from 2018 to 2020, we could see upwards of $10b spent on march madness this year.&amp;#x200b;along with march madness, secular tailwinds for sports betting suggest high upside for genius moving forward. 46 out of 50 states have either passed or presented legislation to legalize sports betting. as states such as ny, ca, tx, and fl legalize betting, revenues streams will swell. data will become increasingly important in this industry as live updates are constantly moving betting lines for books. with multi-year contracts with half of the us’s professional leagues, genius serves as an index for the entire industry.&amp;#x200b;additionally, with pfizer’s vaccine approval, there is little to no risk of massive sports cancellations in the future. genius still grew revenue during covid’s massive disruption. i imagine that the revenue numbers for 2021 will be fantastic.&amp;#x200b;now let’s focus on the stock movement and valuation. genius is valued as $1.4b, or 7.4x 2021 revenues. for a company with high cagr and an industry with massive tailwinds, this seems like a fair, or cheap valuation. note that genius is trading at a steep discount to lower margin businesses such as sportsbooks golden nugget, draftkings, and penn. while investors have been chasing the next hot ev ipo, genius has slowly climbed from $10 to $13. last summer, a rumored feac-sportradar merger led to feac pumping to $15+. sportradar was worth $2.8b in 2018, presenting 60% upside from genius’ current price to reach its competitor’s 2018 valuation! dmyd and genius announced their merger in late october during a market downturn, thus letting it go overlooked. i think this is a sleeper spac that will have a massive influx of news in q1, as its merger aligns with the climax of college basketball and the beginning of march madness. a single benzinga article pumped the stock by almost 20% last week. imagine the upside when the broader market realizes they can invest in the data behind the sports betting industry. &amp;#x200b;personally, i am long $166k in dmyd stock, and have no intention of selling anytime soon. always do your own dd, but i hope this post helps.",6,1,DMYD &amp; Genius Sports: Index for Sports Betting with Strong Tail Winds,Finance

1971,"**personal bias**:* i was swing trading $tsla since early this year with small-sized profits, but always exited positions because i believed it was overvalued. * finally decided to invest in a long position a few weeks before the split after really doing some dd and research on the company. * i'm in my late 20s, and anticipate investing in $tsla for the next 20+ years. * i own 13 shares with an average share price of $428. i have been dca'ing periodically on top of buying bits anytime it dips 6% or more.* i know these are rookie ass numbers and some of y'all have been invested way longer. i just wanted to share my thoughts on $tsla long term! ______________________**why i am extremely bullish**:1. i studied engineering in college like musk (actually he was in physics, but in a related, relevant field) and the concept of ethics + morality is emphasized &amp; deemed imperative throughout engineering + physics classes / seminars / programs. i kinda obsessed over musk this past year to try and understand his persona and character and thought-process and watched any interview i could find online, read his articles, watched live events, read reviews from past/current employees. it was pretty evident that this guy is interested in bettering the world (reducing emissions, decreasing dependence on foreign oil &amp; drilling, self-sustainability in homes, and more). from what i gathered, he genuinely believes in tesla's mission statement and most importantly, is confident in delivering. perhaps this is too anecdotal and emotional to have any real bearing, but i am bullish on companies motivated by the bigger picture (in this case energy).2. he has largely been focused on growth over profit, and this is the only correct approach imo to running a company that is tasked with introducing ground-breaking, societal-changing, futuristic technology to the world. ***here are some of tesla's major costs***:training a neural network to read the road like a human takes an extraordinary amount of resources. you want the ai to have seen every damn inch of the earth so it has exposure to different variabilities while driving and makes the safe, correct maneuver.  another is investing in producing in-house batteries. another is upgrading its facilities to better streamline production and increase efficiency. another is expanding its facilities themselves across the world like germany for example and then domestically like the giga in texas. another is solar technology. none of this stuff is profitable right now. no one is paying tesla for its efforts in optimizing the ai or for any of its other endeavors i just mentioned. they have a 35k car (model 3) to get an ev out there many can afford and thus build a reputation in the public of a working model..... its not to earn profits. tesla is focusing on solidifying its foundations now so that it can be profitable in the (increasingly near) future. 3. let's talk about the super high p/e value for $tsla stock. stock price keeps rising, but earnings stay low. this is the primary metric used by the $tsla bears suggesting the stock is overvalued and in a bubble that's about to burst. but if you agree with the points i made in #2 above, you can understand why the profits are low. $amzn had a period with a p/e of 1000+. in the ensuing years, though, its p/e came back down to more normal levels, but the stock price kept rising. why? because their earnings started to increase. and this is why it takes a believer and due diligence to invest in this stock. do you understand why tesla is focusing on growth over profits right now? do you believe that it can overcome challenges to produce a dope product (and service)? if you say no - then you are fine to think the p/e ratio is too damn high and you should not invest long term. but if you do your research, agree with their approach, and believe that tesla is going to become a highly profitable company, then who fucking cares about the p/e ratio! earnings will come and the p/e value will become averaged and normal while price will also increase. 4. there's the mandate to cease ice vehicle production by 2030-2035. it's a (largely) global mandate and so when that time comes, you're going to have to buy an ev. which guy do you think will have the most refined product? gm, porshe, volkswagen? or tesla, that has ***solely*** focused on ev for its lifespan? do you believe other companies can just magically catch-up and be on par with tesla experience-wise? keep in mind that many auto companies are being forced into ev. watch some (not so) old videos of gm mechanics &amp; engineers who proudly tout their gas-operated ices and mock evs like its some ridiculous technology. can you really believe that despite all these disadvantages, these same guys can produce a product superior to tesla? do you feel comfortable trusting a product with significantly lesser testing time than one who has been at it for years longer?5. autonomous driving. i keep reading that all the auto dealers can easily ""catch-up to the new ev technology"" to be on par with tesla's ev (which btw doesn't really make sense to me). but for fun let's say that somehow it happened. autonomous fsd needs to be tested thoroughly to be deemed safe for public use. won't that take years of trial and error and testing and more beta testing and changes and recalls and delays? like many of you, i've watched the fsd beta videos for tesla street driving ai. it is nothing short of incredible. yes of-course there are problems, though, and they are being worked on. this is all a normal r&amp;d procedure for fsd that any car dealer must complete before releasing to the public. how in the world can they catch-up so quickly then?6. as we have heard from the bulls (*maybe* *too many* *times...*), tesla isn't just a car company. its mission is to reduce emissions, increase self-sustainability (with solar panels for homes, cars), and revolutionize the electric grid with distributing solar power. also they sell these really comfy ass shorts. does gm sell comfy shorts? i'll wait.______________________**things that make me doubt tesla:**1. (this one is simply conjecture, not fact-based). a reduction in enthusiasm / effort towards tesla from elon musk due to having to manage all of his other endeavors. if spacex, starlink go public causing his workload to multiply, can we still expect tesla leadership to run the company with the same drive and motivation?2. i keep reading stories and reviews of tesla cars that need to go in for repairs shorty after being purchased. seat issues, door issues, tires falling out. my neighbor bought a model y and said he had to take it back the first week because there was problems with the seat not moving or something. he did say that after the repair, the car has been perfect and he'll never go back to an ice. still, pretty concerning that so much random shit seems to happen right outta the box. 3. even if they become the sole clear-cut leader in ev auto vehicles (2030), can we justify a market cap that compares to $amzn or $goog or $msft or $aapl? what if they also became the primary all-purpose electric energy solution for residence / commercial sectors? ___________**in summary,** i totally understand the doubts and uncertainties that many people have with buying $tsla stock, and even tesla cars. many investors see the p/e value and call it inflated / in a bubble. folks, this is futuristic, groundbreaking and developing technology. perhaps, just maybe, there are other metrics to gauge a stock then? i recommend reading tesla's engineering news, not just financial reports, to gain a clearer picture. due to some of musk's social media antics, the stock has become a meme stock / robinhooders joke stock (lol). all this time that tesla invests into its growth and r&amp;d (instead of profits), will pave the way for it to produce a leading, refined product in the ev sector. and yes, i did read elon's email about profits earlier today. please share your thoughts. thank you for reading.",2,1,Why I am bullish on Tesla long term.,Finance

to be around $2.5bn (evvty has 50% market share), asian market is \~15x the size of europe (150% yoy growth for evvty in asia). north america’s market is \~$210mn, a 42% increase yoy, with nj and pa the only states currently operating (ny looks promising). management thinks the us will be the largest in the long-term. * undetected from wall street. evolution has almost no analyst coverage in the us and very minimal coverage in europe, presenting opportunity for additional growth as institutional money managers recognize this opportunity and draw attention to the stock. additionally, evolution has a founder-led management team that is highly aligned with shareholders (mgmt owns over 30% of the stock).**facebook (nasdaq: fb) -** enables people to connect through devices. it’s products include facebook, instagram, messenger, whatsapp and oculus. * zuck. it’s not a question of who is the next jobs/bezos/gates/zuck, because zuck is super young. he has a history of being able to execute: ig acquisition / transition from desktop to mobile /  denying multiple acquisition opportunities in his twenties. * undervalued. fb is the cheapest among the faang stocks, yet has some of the highest growth rates. this is mainly because of its continuous political scandals. with trump out of office, i think fb has a chance to stay out of trouble and start to realize higher multiples.  the antitrust lawsuit is not a threat imo, it is actually an opportunity. if the govt forces fb to break up, we would get shares in the spin-offs, which would be valued at a higher multiple than fb. for example, if instagram spun off from fb and traded at the same multiple as snap, instagram’s market cap would be larger than fb’s.**redfin corporation (nasdaq: rdfn) -** provides residential real estate brokerage services. * digitization of real estate (i.e. “ibuying”). technology in re is moving from being informational to transactional. redfin’s ibuying service is dubbed “redfinnow.” the service basically buys homes from sellers looking for a quick and convenient sale (close deals within 10-30 days). this segment isn’t profitable yet as it is just getting started, but promising as the management adapts to technology trends.* inter-us migration and housing outlook. people are moving out of the cities because of covid / trying to avoid taxes / etc. which increases demand for redfin’s services. with interest rates extremely low (and no expectation for them to increase), homebuying demand should continue to grow.* rdfn most attractively valued compared to z and open, with the most upside potential given its market cap \~$7bn. some are predicting rdfn might start offering rental services as well. rdfn has the best lt margin potential. **teladoc health (nyse: tdoc) -** provides virtual healthcare services on a b2b basis to its clients and provides services to consumers directly and through channel partners.* competitive positioning in industry ripe for disruption. healthcare is a huge market yet to be significantly disrupted. covid has accelerated this disruption. providers who were once opposed to telemedicine now realize its benefits and several regulatory changes are promising for telemedicines growth potential. medicare and other government-sponsored coverage is expected to include telemedicine benefits, increasing tdoc’s tam.* livongo acquisition. from the consumer pov, this will increase access to healthcare at a lower cost. teladoc will have access to a larger amount of data it can interpret to refine its services and monetization strategies. **sea ltd (nyse: se) -** digital entertainment, electronic commerce, and digital financial services. the company operates three business segments: garena, shopee, and seamonkey. the company’s digital entertainment business, garena, is a global game developer and publisher with a presence in southeast asia, taiwan, and latin america. garena provides access to mobile and personal computer online games. shopee provides users with a shopping environment that is supported by integrated payment, logistics, fulfillment, and other value-added services. seamonkey business is a digital financial services provider. seamonkey offers e-wallet services, payment processing, credit related digital financial offerings, and other financial products. * diversified consumer internet company with market-leading position. sea caters to southeast asia and taiwan, providing its online gaming, e-commerce, and payment platforms. shopee has overtaken competitors, it is widening its market share lead. esports is a rapidly growing market (15.7% yoy to $1.1bn in 2020) and sea is outpacing market growth.* pay for quality. the best companies keep going up for years in a row, and i think sea is in the early stages of being classified as such a company. it’s worth $100bn but has effectively proved its ability to identify opportunities and expand business lines. * still early stages of developing

2293,"**tl:dr is at the bottom**hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.my name’s mark and i’m an accountant with a passion for investing. about two years ago, i used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the u.s. my goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.i’m a long-term investor. i am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. i’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. if you want to learn more about this approach. i recommend reading the book “100 baggers” by chris mayer.**introduction**i’m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, smartsheet. i’m always looking for investment ideas. i run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. one of the best investment decisions i’ve made to date came after i talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. shout out to you celsius (celh)! with that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.in the case of smartsheet, i became aware of the company through a stock screener. i was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6b), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a subscription business model (saas). once i became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. the more i learned about smartsheet, the more i liked. management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. in different roles i’ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, i’ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. i will touch on this more later in the write up.another positive signal i got about smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. i was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. i was watching an interview on my phone with mark mader, the ceo of smartsheet. my girlfriend overheard the word “smartsheet” mentioned in the video and said “are they talking about the smartsheet with the blue check mark?”. i had to google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same smartsheet. i asked her how she knew about it. she said “my company just transitioned all of our work onto smartsheet. i really love it. our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” hearing this just motivated me to learn more about smartsheet.**the thesis statement**for every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for smartsheet is as follows:*“smartsheet: a leader in collaborative work management (cwm) software. as the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.”*i think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what smartsheet does. if you go to smartsheet’s website and look at the “about” page, you will find their “about” statement which says “smartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.” notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.in my thesis statement, i mention that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm software space. but how do i know this? well, a highly reputable independent research firm named forrester conducted a study on the cwm space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, ui/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. i put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. as you can see, smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. let’s use our common sense for a second. at the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming saas company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? i think the answer should be a resounding yes. but what about these other companies on the list. let’s break them down 1 by 1:* workfront was recently bought by adobe. if you want to invest in workfront, you’d have to invest in the much larger company of adobe. it wouldn’t be a pure play investment into the cwm space.* smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)* wrike is private* servicenow – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space. also, the company is already quite large ($106b market cap)* asana is public but just ipo’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. we don’t have much data to track their performance as a publicly traded company. furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the cwm space, they’re not a leader and rank behind smartsheet in several of forrester’s categories. why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?* monday.com is private* microsoft – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.* atlassian – this company does primarily focus on cwm but i have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) they’re ranked way beneath smartsheet. 2) they’re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58b).now that we’ve established that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm space and that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let’s understand why this is important. other than the obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?well, let’s take a look at this quote from mark mader, smartsheet ceo, during the last earnings call (q3 fy21) that occurred on december 7th, 2020:“leaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. they understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.”key word here: asynchronous. asynchronous communication is different from synchronous communication. here is the difference:asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.any communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. as part of my research on smartsheet, i read an e-book that was written by the original co-founders of smartsheet, mark mader the current ceo and brent frei who is no longer with the company. they wrote the e-book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. the e-book is called “the power of done”. the moral of the book is that mark and brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. this is a quote from their e-book:“according to basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire u.s. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the american economy.”they mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. the fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what mark and brent referred to as the productivity paradox. they wanted to do something about it and thus they founded smartsheet.**how smartsheet makes money**at the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that i mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this isn’t to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things i look at.before i talk about the revenue streams of smartsheet, i want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. co-founder/ceo mark mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as microsoft excel. however, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. he wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. as a result, we now have smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and gantt view.the idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they’re hired to do – get work done. think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they’re at with their assignments. what if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? that’s what smartsheet looks to achieve.for smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. as i mentioned earlier, they are a software as a service (saas) company. whenever you see saas, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that’s a very good thing. with a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.smartsheet’s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based collaborative work management (cwm) platform. customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to smartsheet by collaborating with a company/individual that uses smartsheet. for subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using smartsheet within minutes.smartsheet offers four subscription levels: individual, business, enterprise, and premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.the connectors part of the business is something i find really interesting. basically, smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their smartsheet user interface. this helps position smartsheet as the true “command center” platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. you’ll see this on the link above but some products that smartsheet sells connectors for include adobe creative cloud, microsoft dynamics 365, salesforce, jira software, slack, and skype just to name a few.i think that being able to sell these connectors as ancillary pieces to the smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as “smartsheet competitors” actually become a piece of the smartsheet platform and can be sold by smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. this neutral angle that smartsheet is able to come from by selling connectors to their perceived “competitors” reminds me a little bit of how roku (roku) is able to earn revenue off of selling a netflix subscription on their platform. i think just the fact that all these big companies like adobe, jira, salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn’t allow for their products to be integrated with smartsheet.on top of the connectors to third party vendors that smartsheet is able to sell, smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. for example, in may 2019, smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. the name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them.also, in september 2020, smartsheet acquired brandfolder, inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. combining brandfolder capabilities with smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. this goes back to what i said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company’s marketing team was “really excited about smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” she told me that before smartsheet, her company’s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. she said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and sharepoint. now, all of the content is inside of smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. they can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. the acquisition of brandfolder is really what allows smartsheet to stand out in this department.nobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. the fact that smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with brandfolder is very promising. during smartsheet’s fy21 engage customer conference, anna griffin, smartsheet chief marketing officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500b for companies around the world. she said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to editor in chief. all kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company’s brand. sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and r&amp;d is teasing new product experiences in app. it can get really difficult for the company’s marketing/branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like brandfolder in smartsheet. this is just one reason why i think smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.as you can see, smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core cwm platform, the connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and brandfolder. on top of that, smartsheet also provides workapps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. there are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. traditionally, companies need to engage their it departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. this places a lot of strain on it departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. mark mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. he believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an it department employee who doesn’t even do the job that the app is being built for. also, he believes this will reduce strain on it departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.here is a quote from the director of sales (hina patel) at a smartsheet customer, cisco (nasdaq: csco): “i have been waiting for a solution like workapps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,” said hina patel, director of sales operations at cisco. “the ability to take our smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.” as you can see, the value proposition of workapps and the smartsheet platform appears to be high.lastly, smartsheet also generates revenue from professional services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the smartsheet platform. in the most recent quarter, q3 fy21, professional services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:subscription revenue = $90,890m for 91.8% of total revenueprofessional services revenue = $8,043m for 8.2% of total revenuethis is the end of my first article about smartsheet. my goal is to drop part 2 within the next week. the focus of part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question – “can we 10x from here?”**tl:dr*** this is part 1 of my two part deep dive

2758,"been debating switching to bitcoin. especially with the rise in socialism it looks like america is going to become the next venezuela or zimbabwe. and with rising inflation, $1 today may be worth .01 cents tomorrow. also, all of the companies on the stock market are centralized so even if the stock market has high returns than the dollar it will the centralized companies will go down if the dollar goes down too. also, with the state of the hiring market, even before coronavirus it also shows that most of these companies aren't really here for the people and just want to capitalize while they take the time you use working for them that you could be using to better yourself, and they're using your time for their profit. whereas, cryptocurrency is for the people.as an argument, some people say some of the altcoins are scams, or they're too volatile. the way i look at it, is it's similar to bartering days of medieval and earlier times where people didn't work 40 hour weeks. where people worked by performing services for the community instead of working a set number of hours for one company. so they may spend a few hours farming, and maybe two hours building a house or making clothes etc. the people then exchanged those goods using gold, silver, hell even tulips (which you could say is like some altcoins). however, gold and silver are outdated and mainly only boomers buy gold and silver now. the main problem with gold and silver is you hypothetically could use it trade for something, but then you'd be like what now i'm just stuck with this block of gold that sits there and does nothing. whereas, bitcoin and altcoins are algorithms set in the blockchain that are efficient and don't require human labor to produce as gold does. so, bitcoin and other coins aer a set exchange rate that cannot be manipulated by crooked banks or work labor as in fiat currency, or through hard labor like gold, silver, palladium, oil, and other commodities.basically, the way i see it is gold, oil, silver will remain flat with a few ups and downs, but it will barely move. stocks, will have periods of ecstatic irrationality; however, even though it looks like they're a better bet than the dollar, a lot of stocks will still move down with the price of a dollar. also, when you're investing in stock it still feels like your investing in a company whose main goal is profit, and it doesn't incentivize the company to hire more people, it doesn't help the community, and heck it doesn't even confirm if the shareholders value will go up because the company could be mismanaging funds. also, like many tech companies they can make a lot of revenue, but it seems so many of them can't produce a profit because they're so poorly managed. it makes me think if they treat their employees this bad and they can't produce a profit, why would it make sense to invest in them?bitcoin seems like it promotes equality the most out of all of them. however, i feel the normal society will never catch on because they are asleep. also, i don't think the lawmakers would ever enact a change to get rid of a 40 hour work week and go back to a bartering model. it also, opens up too much litigation due to scammers, unproven models, and false claims of operating schemes by coin operators. this may cause governments to centralize models which would reduce the whole point of bitcoin and just turn it into another commodity like gold, silver, etc. is it worth it to get into bitcoin with inflation running up, or is it really a scam and too volatile like most people say?",5,0,Switch to bitcoin from stocks?,Finance

3279,"**here’s the market roundup for last week and the forecast for the week ahead.**the s&amp;p 500, spx went sideways, moving up on stimulus and vaccine hopes and lower on higher covid deaths and lockdowns, [a weak jobs report and rising unemployment claims](https://www.barrons.com/articles/the-jobs-report-was-ugly-but-it-may-be-good-news-for-stocks-51607130127?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street). opening at 3,699, it moved to a new record high of 3,702 but closed the week lower at 3,663 with a small drop of 36 points, [or about 1%.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$spx/interactive-chart)the nasdaq composite, $nasx dropped 0.7%, in tandem, but saw more volatility; from 12,464 it moved to a new high of  12,583 on tuesday before swinging to a big 2% drop on wednesday, but recovered to 12,379 by friday, off just 86 points or [0.7% for the week.](https://www.barchart.com/stocks/quotes/$nasx/interactive-chart)# reasons for the drop:**fatigue and profit taking**: for the $nasx, the drop was largely due to profit taking after a 6 day winning streak. the nasdaq had been making new highs after the elections on an almost daily basis and the drop was not unexpected and if it were not for optimism of the skinny stimulus bill passing in the senate, i would have expected a larger drop.**lack of stimulus**: not to belabor the obvious, congress gave us another head fake. a skinny stimulus package of about $800bn presented by a bi-partisan group of democrats and republicans seemed to have a strong possibility of passing the senate at the beginning of the week, petered out in the usual finger pointing between the two responsible parties.**sentiment overshoot**: post election the spx had moved up almost 9%, in what i believe is a sentiment overshoot. cash levels with fund managers are extremely low at 4%, a level last seem in 2007 and not seen since the great financial crash.**too much optimism** – an overbought market: too many calls and not enough puts. i follow a fairly reliable contrarian indicator called the put/call open interest ratio.the put/call open interest ratio came back to prominence and gained tremendous significance as an indicator in 2020 with the rise in option trading from the robin hood cohort.the put/call open interest ratio looks at the open interest at the end of the day in the total number of put and call options outstanding for the indices, etf’s and individual stocks. on a historical basis, the open interest ratio for stocks is usually below 1 – that is, traders usually buy more calls than puts. for example, the put/call ratio for pfizer is 0.2, i.e., or for every put outstanding at the end of  a trading day, there are 4 calls. that’s normal and understandable; with the vaccine, everyone expects pfizer to rise and who would short it?this ratio had been flashing warning signals with readings of 0.37 on dec 7th, 0.35 on dec 3rd and 0.4 on [dec 8th](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&amp;dt=2020-12-08), meaning that there were 2.5 times more calls than puts. when the ratio is around 0.6 to 0.7 it’s around the mean but when it’s so low it works well a contrarian indicator. - as it did around feb 23rd when the spx peaked pre covid at 3,386. that time as well, the ratio was just 0.38.  it again proved reliable during the week of  june 4th when the spx had regained most of its covid losses and had reached 3,232, after which it went into the summer swoon because of the explosion of cases in the midwest and the imposition of lockdowns. on june 9th the spx dropped 6%. similarly, we saw another implosion in late august and early sep, when the equity open interest ratio flashed  4 ratios of 0.37 to 0.42. at that time, the famous japanese whale was allegedly playing with $50 bn of options, most of them faamg calls! in a matter of 2 weeks in sep the spx lost 9.6% and the $nasx 11.8%. the total put call ratio is usually above 1, because it includes open interest of not just stocks , but also includes index and etf options. and it’s not because there are more shorts than longs, it’s because more traders need to hedge their positions and buying an index, or an etf put is one of the cheapest ways to do so. this too indicated an overbought market with data points of [0.65 to 0.68](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&amp;dt=2020-12-08). the lowest this ratio had reached in 2020 was in the last week of february, around the pre-covid peak.# the week ahead**stimulus and vaccine priced in**: yes, the vaccine will help return us to a new normal, but we still have to navigate a holiday season of travel and social interaction which will make an already macabre season of 235,000 daily new cases and almost 3,000 deaths, worse in the next 3 weeks. i believe that the vaccine and the stimulus is priced in and getting to new highs from here is going to be much more difficult.the ipo euphoria of airbnb and doordash shows a very speculative and overbought market.barron’s has a great story on why this is looking a lot like 1999, and one should read this article in its entirety to get what a sense of euphoria looked like. [“maybe this time is different. those words, supposedly the most dangerous to utter in the investing realm, came to mind amid the frenzied pops in the highly anticipated initial public offerings of the past week.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/from-airbnb-to-tesla-its-starting-to-feel-like-1999-all-over-again-51607700149?refsec=up-and-down-wall-street)”i believe the market will remain rangebound in the next week, with the key catalyst being the stimulus or lack of. since this clearly is in the hands of congress, i would refrain from trading on any assumptions. however, i do believe the damage will be greater if we don’t get a decent stimulus and the upside limited if we do get one.having said that, i do agree with [nomura’s mcelligot](https://heisenbergreport.com/2020/12/10/hot-takes-galore-key-macro-thoughts-and-good-stuff-with-nomuras-mcelligott/), who’s been spot on with his market prognostications in 2020. he believes the long term trend is intact and dips should be bought.as does marko kolanovic, global head of jp morgan’s chase, equity strategy division and another brilliant market strategist.

3522,"note: i originally posted this on r/dividends so the writing caters more towards dividends but can be applied to general investing. mods hope that’s cool!i occasionally lurked the dividends sub and one thing i noticed was how many stocks are in people’s portfolios. throwing most of your money into 30+ random companies after googling “dividend kings” or “stocks with the highest dividends” is not what dividends are about. dividends are passive income in form of passive investing. when you pick stocks you get a shot of dopamine. dopamine is the “reward” neurotransmitter that tells our brains we want more; yet every substance or behavior that releases dopamine in the extreme leads to addiction. you try to motivate yourself to constantly seek out that next dividend stock to add to your portfolio. you assume your picks can beat the market gains. this generally leads to a general depression of dopamine which is anxiety. you’re constantly checking your portfolio, your emotions get the best of you which clouds your judgement and you make some wrong picks. that “king” cut its dividends and now its price has pummeled, your reit no longer manages its buildings because there is no foot traffic, international ends up performing better next decade. there’s a reason why they say people who pick stocks don’t end up beating market returns.on the flip side, serotonin is the “contentment” neurotransmitter that tells our brains we don’t need any more. you’re invested in broad index funds. you don’t give a shit who increases/decreases their dividends or who goes bankrupt. you look at your portfolio maybe once every few months. while this is sound, the pressures of today’s society has made us actively seek receptors that makes this extremely difficult. you’re making progress but it’s slower than you imagined, you’re bored. you’re watching strangers on the internet make hundreds of thousands from just one play. you decide to ditch the course and go onto another path to end up losing it all.now that we’ve discussed dopamine vs serotonin portfolios here’s my personal take. my first year investing included stock picking, chasing yields, and high-risk get rich quick plays in a dopamine portfolio. after losing some of my hard earned money, i eventually switched to a serotonin portfolio consisting of exclusively index funds. after i reached my first 100k between my 401k, roth, and taxable i decided to do the math and i seen that i would still retire a multi-millionaire if i kept maxing out my 401k and roth every year with a 7% return since i started young. i’ve decided to use an approach where work income would go into my serotonin portfolio and income from bonuses or side hustles would go towards my dopamine portfolio. spend a couple years grinding my ass off to build that dopamine portfolio. got promotions, purchased a rental, delivered food, drove people around, etc. you’d be surprised how much money you can make on the side as long as you put the work in. i will knowledge that i had no social life at this stage of my life since i was addicted to making money, hence the dopamine so it does come with some drawbacks on your mental state. fast forward, now i’m sitting comfortably with a 200k+ portfolio. a majority of it is primarily in index funds, a couple thousand for day trading and options, and shares in apple and pepsi. looking to add jpm soon! i’m very selective when it comes to individual shares. not only do they have to have a dividend, but i have to support the company enough to where my minimum investment is 10k. i understand the risks of stock picking and if i lost my money, i’d be more devastated in the company not performing well/going under because i value them. i think this creates a good balance between dopamine and serotonin. you get the boring, old reliables and you also get the hot shots who can help you reach your goals faster as long as you don’t let them come too close to the sun. i personally think people should not pick stocks unless they have reached the first grueling 100k but it’s your money. do your dd and decide what aligns with your goals. my hopes were to introduce some science behind investing to new and veterans. i’m currently earning 4k almost 5k in dividends every year with 2%+ yield. as you can see i don’t chase yields. if my portfolio consisted of primarily high-yield dividend stocks my portfolio would not be where it’s at right now since i’d miss out on a historical bull run. anyways, my fingers are now getting tired. i hope you enjoyed reading my post as much as i enjoyed typing it.",9,1,Dopamine and Serotonin in Investing,Finance

3807,"brexit talks look shaky and, as a result, the sterling trade-weighted index remains weak, although it is offs the lows of earlier in 2020 which most likely reflects the fact that the dollar trade-weighted index has been weaker.a deal between the uk and the eu is in everyone's commercial interests, so let's hope they get there!weakness in the dollar index has been a feature of 2020 to date. should the dollar index close below 90, it opens the way for considerable further weakness.the question is: are us economic and monetary fundamentals that much worse than for its major trading partners? after all, the eu is hardly a picture of economic health and interest rates in europe are even lower than in the us.at present, investors such as myself appear more concerned about the scale of the upcoming fiscal stimulus in the us compared to elsewhere. the us has always had a growth bias and in the past has had no calms about letting its currency take the adjustment.gold: a weak dollar offers a decent tailwind for the gold price given that gold is priced in dollars. the chart is an update and highlights where the gold price is compared to its underlying trend, which i assume is represented by its 30-week moving average.in this latest correction in gold's uptrend, the gold price has dipped below its 30-week moving average. that was a normal feature of the 2001 to 2011 gold bull market and each time it recovered and went on to make fresh highs.i am working on the assumption that the samepattern will play itself out this time around. so, what is it that gives us confidence that the gold price remains in an uptrend?-firstly, the dollar index remains in a fairly pronounced downtrend, although one would expect support around current levels.-secondly, us long-term interest rates remain below the rate of us consumer price inflation (cpi), and with us cpi likely to pick up in 2021 the gap can only widen. negative real interest rates (i.e. interest rates below inflation) have always provided a tailwind for gold.-thirdly, a gold price declining below its 30-week moving average is not a 'sell' signal. under the technical indicator we track for gold, a 'sell' signal requires the 30-week moving average price to decline below the 50-week moving average price. given that both the 30-week and 50-week moving averages remain in uptrends, we are not near any such 'sell' signal.the only negative for the gold price is that it remains well above its intrinsic value (which we estimate to be in the region of $1,250 an ounce). on balance, we continue to believe that the weight of arguments support the bullish case for gold. investment demand for gold is likely to stay strong in an environment where the federal reserve (the us central bank) continues to print money to finance massive us fiscal and trade deficits and in the knowledge that us interest rates cannot be increased for fear of causing more economic damage.as always i appreciate your feedback and i hope this was of use to you.

3940," **industry overview**shopify competes in the broad e-commerce industry. competitors include amazon, ebay, etsy, bigcommerce, and many other companies. competitors are either platforms like amazon that connects buyers and sellers or software companies that offer the same or similar services to shopify. the e-commerce market is broad and is always expanding. it has seen tremendous growth during covid-19 and it will likely continue growing long afterward.e-commerce has been one of the largest trends over the past two decades as more and more consumers turn to amazon or other online stores to buy products. this trend has only accelerated as covid-19 has forced buyers online to buy many of their purchases.**business overview**shopify was founded in 2004 by tobias lütke, daniel weinand, and scott lake after lütke struggled to find competent e-commerce software to enable merchants to sell products online. lütke, originally a computer programmer by trade, made his own software. this was the start of shopify. the original founders eventually rebranded to shopify after originally starting as “snowdevil” in 2004.shopify provides tools for merchants (entrepreneurs, small businesses, medium businesses, and large customers) to manage storefronts. although the traditional focus of shopify has been to allow merchants to sell physical products online, shopify has expanded into offering point-of-sale hardware as well as additional tools such as the shopify fulfillment network, shopify capital, and 6 river systems' collaborative warehouse fulfillment solutions. all these tools have been created in order to help entrepreneurs run and scale their businesses. shopify has long term goals in place to continue to innovate and build out more services and offerings for its merchant base.this is the primary goal of shopify. the running slogan is that shopify wants to “arm the rebels” and help them compete against large players like amazon.shopify serves as the central nervous system for over 1 million merchants as of the end of 2019. this number has likely only increased due to the covid-19 pandemic and the rush to buy and sell products online. some of the tools that merchants have access to via their store dashboard are analytics, data, inventory, orders, payments, and many other tools you can think of.many entrepreneurs and small businesses sell courses, digital products, or other offerings through shopify. although shopify might be thought of as a company that benefits strictly from selling physical goods, this is not the case. this is another interesting point about shopify and my personal investment thesis. shopify is benefitting from many tailwinds such as the rise of the creator economy, direct-to-consumer brands, and entrepreneurship.**total addressable market**shopify's total addressable is defined as around $78bn in their financial filings, but of course, this is only growing over time. shopify is empowering more and more people to become entrepreneurs and make it easier for anyone to sell a product or service online. shopify is actively expanding its total addressable market.one of the interesting ideas about innovative companies like shopify is that these companies expand their own market. i briefly touch on this below.for example, previously most people were deterred from starting a business because it’s too difficult, expensive, or time-consuming. shopify changed this. starting an online store can be as easy as spending 1 hour and $29. previously, starting an online business required some heavy coding expertise or lots of software to piece together all the parts of an internet business. more and more people are confident to start an online store because of the ease of using shopify and all the tools and integrations it offers.shopify has the potential to expand into other adjacent markets related to online commerce. this doesn’t necessarily need to be physical products or even virtual products. any financial transaction that occurs could one day be powered by shopify to some extent. if it’s a business trying to build a brand or a solo entrepreneur building a paid community of like-minded people then shopify may play a role in enabling this. to some extent, shopify already offers some of these services mainly through the partner ecosystem and all the apps that are available.**competitive advantages**from a shallow dive perspective, shopify has a good set of competitive advantages.* **scale**  because of its size, shopify is able to pump more money into r&amp;d to enable new offerings to its merchant base. smaller competitors don’t stand a chance competing against shopify. shopify offers more tools through its dashboard and partner ecosystem than smaller competitors will ever have time or money to build. merchants utilize multiple services to build a complete and functioning online store. small startups don’t stand a chance trying to build out a shipping network, offering the equivalent of shopify capital, or all the integrations and apps offered through the partner ecosystem.* **partner ecosystem**  this is one of the most interesting aspects of shopify and it’s similar to many other platforms. this is a mini-network effect buried in shopify. as more designers, developers, and other partners join shopify’s partner ecosystem, more and more merchants will be attracted to the breadth of offerings of themes, apps, integrations, and more. this will in turn attract more partners, and more merchants, and so on.  this is a small network effect and isn’t terribly important in the grand scheme of things on shopify, but it sure does keep competitors out and it attracts more merchants to use shopify. another benefit for shopify is that this provides a look into the future. shopify can see which apps are most popular among merchants and shopify can develop tools, offerings, or simply buyout these apps from developers. shopify did this with [oberlo](https://www.startuplithuania.com/news/shopify-has-acquired-oberlo/) in 2017.  as more apps are developed on the platform and more competitors offer software tools for entrepreneurs, shopify can jump ahead of the competition and buyout these tools or build something to compete with them. for example, if you believe that gated content will be popular in the future, there are already apps that exist on the shopify platform to enable gated content for paid communities. shopify can buyout these tools or build a similar offering from the inside to benefit from this trend.* **switching costs**  merchants don’t want to waste time switching stores, remaking whole websites, managing inventory just to save a few bucks a month. the headache involved with switching websites and storefronts is not worth the small potential cost savings of switching from shopify to another competitor.  merchants want to focus on their business rather than working on smaller details that will not vastly improve their business. customers also become familiar with shopify’s dashboard and the rest of the layout of the backend software leading to familiarity and increased productivity. the headache of switching and becoming familiar with the shopify platform are some of the switching costs that give shopify a sustainable competitive advantage.&amp;#x200b;**financials**shopify has some pretty incredible financial results through the end of 2019, and the covid-19 pandemic has only accelerated their results. these numbers are from the end of 2019, so the results during 2020 are different and may lead to a different result if you’re thinking about investing in them.**2019:*** total revenue = \~$1.58bn* subscription solutions revenue = \~$640mn* merchant solutions revenue = \~$940mn* gmv = \~$61.1bn* gross profit = \~$870mn**2018:*** total revenue = \~$1.07bn* subscription solutions revenue = \~$460mn* merchant solutions

gross profit = \~$380mnthere are many other aspects of shopify’s financial information to dig into such as the differences in the cost of revenues between the software-related revenue and the merchant solutions revenue. this is just a shallow dive and if you’re interested in doing a full deep dive on shopify, do your own due diligence and valuation work.**what’s interesting**shopify is one of the few companies that has been able to compete against amazon and be successful thus far. amazon is a behemoth of a company and typically companies don’t survive if amazon tries to enter their industry. shopify is an outlier.shopify also benefits from some interesting tailwinds such as the move for companies to sell direct-to-consumer (dtc), e-commerce, and the creator economy that i’ll now dig into more below.**dtc**many companies are skipping the traditional method of selling by going through amazon, walmart, or other “middlemen” and instead relying on facebook, google, and other advertising in order to get out in front of customers. selling directly to consumers has multiple benefits. first, products sold directly to consumers typically have a higher gross margin. second, companies are able to establish a brand and a direct relationship with customers when going directly to them instead of going through a middleman.companies like nike, lululemon, and many other companies (not just clothing companies) are investing in this new revenue line in order to grow profit margins. shopify “arms the rebels” by enabling companies to establish their own brand instead of simply selling a product on amazon where consumers might just be comparing the cheapest option.**e-commerce**everyone knows e-commerce is growing and it’s not even a majority of the total gmv sold in the world. covid-19 has accelerated e-commerce by a decade.**creator economy**as more entrepreneurs look to create physical products, digital products, or facilitate transactions online, shopify will serve as the foundation for many of these people. whether it’s youtube personalities creating merchandise or people on twitter creating courses, communities, or gated content, shopify will help to power many of these transactions. shopify has the ability to empower these creators and collect a small portion of revenue based on their success.**future questions*** **valuation?**  shopify has seen tremendous growth during the covid-19 pandemic and its stock price has risen above $1,000. more work is needed to understand the long-term potential of shopify and whether the current price gives investors a fair rate of return over the next 3-5 years. i think shopify has many potential tailwinds but valuation may be a concern to some investors.* **10x potential?**  shopify has a market cap of \~$144bn which makes it one of the largest tech companies. if you’re looking for 10x potential like i am, shopify may not be the best company for you, but i do think it has the potential to grow. shopify is still growing revenue at a fast rate and there seems to be a long runway of growth ahead of it.  there are only 4 companies that are above $1tn in market cap (microsoft, google, apple, and amazon). these are the largest companies in the world and it’s difficult to say that any company will be above $1tn, but i do think shopify has this potential if they continue to empower entrepreneurs, small businesses, and all other businesses in the world.**conclusion**shopify is an innovative and interesting company that i believe has a long runway of growth and lots of future potential. shopify has room to expand into other areas to help empower entrepreneurs and small businesses.**fun facts**shopify refers to its people and partners as shopifolk.&amp;#x200b;if you're reading this, i hope you've

4127,"hi. my name is the rad menace and i'm a business nerd. business models fascinate me. ever since i came across crypto it has dominated my thoughts. i'm not trying to sell you crypto, rather i believe these new fangled business models are game changing. due to the us gov having both thumbs up it's ass, the crypto rules are not very well defined by law. many of the articles out there are either filled with technical jargon or trash price predictions. because of this, i've decided to put crypto into terms other business minded people might understand. this industry is broad and this article is a 10,000 foot view, so i guarantee there is an exception to anything i say, but i'll attempt to explain how to look at a cryptocurrency as a company. what is cryptocurrency?cryptocurrency is somewhat of a misnomer because it is not exclusively currency. cryptocurrency in itself refers to a new fangled standardized internet ""token"" based on the creation of blockchain databases. this is the first time something can represent finite ownership over the internet without a middleman. this is a game changer. some people call crypto ""the internet of value"". it is important to note that not all crypto tokens create their own blockchain, some are built on the back of another blockchain. dapps (decentralized applications) can be built on a chain such as ethereum and release their own token. generally speaking, these tokens are used to pay for whatever services the dapp offers.since the creation of the internet, the biggest issue has been piracy. ownership of something digital over the internet was impossible because the files could be copy / pasted and shared. companies found the only way to combat this was to have a centralized authority who decides who owns what. a few examples include bloomberg machines that are needed to view their proprietary data, buying videos on amazon that must be viewed on their platform, buying music that must be listened to via itunes, or paypal moving money from one user to another. the issue with this model is that any of these middlemen could change the rules on you or go out of business, and you could lose the files you purchased through them. with crypto, these centralized authorities are no longer needed. the underlying blockchain technology makes sure the ownership of your digital data can't be forged or duplicated, and since it isn’t owned by the middleman, you can take your files to another platform easily.anything could be turned into a crypto token, such as stocks, bonds, art, cards, data, computing power, data storage, news articles, ect. a bunch of bored nerds have built lots of intriguing infrastructure around these tokens and this concept and there is a ton of innovation coming out of it, which has brought in investment money as well as a lot of scams. the crypto ecosystem wasn’t planned out by some large corporation, rather it was built by the bored nerds just because they could. a few of the innovations coming out of this ecosystem include the blurring of the lines between cash and liquid assets, the idea of digital commodities controlled by no one party, and fully decentralized autonomous organizations with no need for a leadership team. cryptocurrency currently has its own parallel financial system built to accept these “tokens”. when you buy one, you are buying a unique digital token which can be owned and traded. you don't necessarily have voting rights, like when you own a stock, instead you own a piece of the company's product. the product can vary widely and there is no telling what new ideas will come out in the future. many crypto startups require you to use their token to purchase whatever service they offer and pay their ""employees"" with this token. this creates some interesting supply and demand dynamics. long term, the crypto financial system and the traditional financial system will merge. even longer term, many things in the real world will also be imported to the token system. if this ecosystem sounds confusing, it's because it is, and it's still developing and evolving. there are many factors that differentiate cryptos but i'm going to focus on three: how the company is governed, where do new tokens come from, and what is the company's product. 3 factor framework for analyzing crypto companieshow is the crypto governed?a cryptocurrency’s governance structure defines who makes the rules for the crypto token or the company. these rules can define anything about the algorithm or the company, such as who produces new tokens, how many tokens are produced, or specifics about the blockchain. centralized model: these cryptos have a person or organization behind them creating the rules generally running it like a company. an example of this is the crypto company ripple or facebook's libra. while ripple has a tradable token and you pay for usage of the ripple network using this token, the centralized team holds most of the token and has total control over the algorithm, how much of the token is produced, and what the company does. ripple also does all of the processing of the code to run the crypto and its blockchain, leaving a single point of failure. another example is a company that releases a crypto as a funding mechanism, but the token itself does nothing special. this type of crypto will most likely be regulated as a stock but only time will tell. decentralized model: these cryptos are not necessarily controlled by any one party, and instead are owned and controlled by the users and producers of the token. these decentralized cryptos give the user and investor confidence that a company won't try and change something that is a detriment to the system. an example of this is ethereum. while ethereum still has a centralized team working on projects and upgrades, they do not produce the new tokens or process their own code. instead, anyone with 32 ether and a desktop computer can run the ethereum blockchain, acting as the employees while getting paid in ether. these decentralized cryptos will most likely be regulated as commodities.decentralized autonomous organizations: this is a subsect of decentralized cryptos companies and they are totally autonomous. this means the company doesn't have a leadership team, anyone can join in and do the work, and the rules are exclusively based on code. the original example of this is bitcoin. bitcoins blockchain is voted on based on processing power, and people are paid in bitcoin to perform this work. these will most likely get regulated as a commodity as well. where do new tokens come from?cryptocurrency companies create new tokens through a variety of mechanisms. this category is closely linked with it's governance structure. this could be compared to the federal reserve who decides when to print new us dollars and who receives them. some companies mix several of these options together. crowd sale: this is essentially an auction, where a company sells the token to the highest bidders. companies generally use this as a funding mechanism, raising money to create their product or fund operations. companies that sell crypto this way may be regulated as a stock, similar to raising money via a class c stock with no voting rights.  mining: mining is a process of verifying the blockchain based on computing power. new tokens are created and rewarded to the miners based on the amount of computing power they added to the system. staking: staking is a process of locking up a certain number of tokens and receiving rewards or punishments for system uptime and downtime. this process requires less computing power than mining because you have something at stake if you have downtime. other: who knows what new forms we will see over time. what is the crypto's product?there are an unlimited number of uses for cryptocurrency and blockchain databases. many products out right now directly compete with each other. like any other network, the network effect will consolidate these products into a monopoly or an oligarchy market. this is in no way an exhaustive list, it's simply an overview.currency: the easiest product to fathom is a currency. since cash can't be exchanged over the internet, we have to rely on companies like paypal connecting to a bank connecting to another person on paypal connecting to their bank. for international transactions this process is even more difficult. the most famous example of a currency is bitcoin. this model has historically seen the most fraud, where someone holds a crowd sale of a currency that does nothing special and walks away with the money.processing power: the second largest cryptocurrency is ethereum and their product is processing power. ethereum is essentially a decentralized database that is constantly checking whatever code is written on the ether tokens. you can write any kind of simple or complex code and have it automatically executed by the blockchain. the catch, you must pay to access this processing power using the ether token. moving money quickly and cheaply: the third largest cryptocurrency is ripple. ripple allows you to exchange money from any currency to any other currency almost instantly for a low fee. you must pay this fee using ripple's token.stable coin: stable coins attempt to emulate the price of an underlying asset. facebook's libra did this by making a basket of currencies and assets, while things like tether attempt to keep the price at $1 usd. decentralized finance: the newest trend in crypto is known as defi. these cryptos automate normal bank functions, such as lending, insurance, investing, ect. once again, you pay for their service using their token. non fungible tokens (nfts): these tokens are identifiers that allow you to hold a unique item on the blockchain. companies use this to store, prove and verify ownership of an item in the real world over the internet. things such as art and land are already being stored on the blockchain.there is way too much to simply explain in an article. the crypto ecosystem is still evolving. looking at the three factors of governance structure, token creation, and the company's product, you have a framework with which to analyze these new business models. keep your eyes peeled for new articles.  signing off

4269,"  **tl:dr*** this is part 1 of my two part deep dive on draftkings   (ticker: dkng, i will refer to the company as “dk”)* this first part introduces you to (1) me, (2) the company, (3) my thesis on the company, and (4) digs into how they make      money.* the second part (to be released later this week) will go in depth to explore the question “can we 10x from here?”* dk is an exciting, disruptive company working to change how we experience watching sports and make it better.* i am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. these are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.hello, welcome to my first deep dive write up.my name’s mark and i’m an accountant with a passion for investing. about two years ago, i used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the u.s. my goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.i’m a long-term investor. i am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. i’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. if you want to learn more about this approach. i recommend reading the book “100 baggers” by chris mayer.**introduction**i think it’s fitting that my first stock pick has to do with sports. sports has been a part of my life since i could walk at the age of 2. first with baseball and soccer, and then later in my childhood with golf. i’ve always played american football and basketball for fun as well and have always been an avid fan of all the major sports in the us.i started playing fantasy sports (mostly just fantasy football) about 6 years ago and have always enjoyed it. traditionally, with fantasy football you draft a team at the beginning of the year and those are your players for the rest of the season. if you have a bad draft, oh well. you can try to improve your team with trades and free agent additions but it is tough. leagues usually consist of 10-14 teams (each managed by an individual) and there’s obviously only one winner at the end of the season (about 4 months after the draft). this can lead to the managers of the lower performing teams losing interest as the season wanes on. i believe draftkings’ (dk) founders saw this issue and saw an opportunity. enter, daily fantasy sports. now, with the dk platform you can draft a new team every week. or if you want, every day. this allows fans of fantasy sports to engage at whichever point of the season they want and at varying financial stakes.**the thesis statement**for every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for dk is as follows:*“draftkings: the leader in allowing fans to engage financially with their favorite sports, teams, and players. having money at stake makes the game a lot more interesting to watch. the era of daily fantasy sports games, online sports betting, and online betting (outside of sports), is just getting started and dk is as well positioned (or better positioned) than anyone to capitalize off of this trend.”*notice how i said “allowing fans to engage financially” as the first sentence and not necessarily “allowing fans to gamble”. there’s a reason for that. according to us federal law, daily fantasy sports (dfs) contests have specifically been exempted from the prohibitions of the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act (uigea). dk has always been, and i believe will continue to be dfs contests 1st, sports betting 2nd, and other forms of gambling/entertainment 3rd.  it is noteworthy that states at an individual level can still deem dfs contests illegal if they so wish, but as of this writing (11/26/20), 43 of the 50 us states allow dfs contests and dk, accordingly, is offering dfs contests in all 43 of those us states.i’ll try to clarify the difference between dfs contests and sports betting real quick:**dfs contest –** pay a pre-set entry fee to enter a contest. all entry fees go towards “the pot”. “draft” 9 players to be on your “team” for 1 week. enter your “roster” into a contest with other players (could range from 1 other person to 1,000s of people, the dk user can choose). whichever “roster” amasses the most points for that week out of all contestants wins. the winner will get the highest payout, and depending on the nature of the contest, other top finishers will receive smaller payouts as well.**sports gambling –** team a is considered a 10 point favorite to defeat team b. this means that team a is expected, by the professional gambling line setters, to outscore team b by 10 points. this is known as a point spread. you can bet on the underdog or the favorite. if you bet on the favorite, they have to win by more than 10 points for you to win the bet. if you bet on the underdog, you will win the bet as long as the underdog keeps the game within less than a 10 point defeat.these are just a couple simple examples to help you see the difference. sports gambling (the 2nd priority of dk) is a very lucrative market just as the dfs contests are. however, in the us, federal laws and regulations are a lot stricter on sports gambling than they are on dfs. as of this writing (11/27/20), 22 states (including the district of columbia) out of 51 possible allow sports gambling.dk is still in the infancy stages of getting their sports gambling business going. in the 22 states where they could potentially operate, they currently have a sports gambling offering in 11 of those states. the sports gambling business model for dk can be broken into two main offerings – mobile sports betting, and retail sports betting. mobile sports betting means you can place a sports bet online from the comfort of your own home, while retail sports betting means you must go to a casino and place a bet with the sportsbook in person. i personally believe mobile sports betting is the real potential cash cow for dk out of the two types of sports betting offerings due to the convenience and ease of access. dk is currently working on and encouraging customers to lobby their state lawmakers to legalize sports gambling in more states.**how dk makes money**at the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that i mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this isn’t to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things i look at.for dk, their means of making money is quite simple. i already went into detail above about dfs contests and sports gambling. in dk’s latest 10-q filing with the sec (filed 11/13/20), revenue is broken out into two main streams: online gaming and gaming software.**online gaming (82% of total revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**online gaming is the true core business of dk and includes the aforementioned dfs contests, sports gambling and additional gambling (non-sports) opportunities. dk refers to their additional gambling (non-sports) as “igaming” or “online casino”.for the 9 months ended 9/30/20, online gaming revenue totaled $239m, up 30% yoy from $184m in the same prior year period. keep in mind, that this is an increase that happened during a covid-19 global pandemic that delayed and shortened many professional sports seasons.online gaming revenue is earned in a few ways that are slightly different, but very similar overall.  in order to enter a dfs contest, a customer must pay an entry fee. dfs revenue is generated from these entry fees collected, net of prize payouts and customer incentives awarded to users. in order to place a sports bet (sports gambling), a customer places a wager with a dk sportsbook. the dk sportsbook sets odds for each wager that builds in a theoretical margin allowing dk to profit. sports gambling revenue is generated from wagers collected from customers, net of payouts and incentives awarded to winning customers. the last form of online gaming revenue is earned in similar fashion to a land-based casino, offering online versions of casino games such as blackjack, roulette, and slot machines.**gaming software (18% of total revenue for 9 months ended 9/30/20):**while the online gaming revenue stream mentioned above is a business to consumer (b2c) model, the gaming software revenue stream is a business to business (b2b) model. the gaming software side of the business was born out of the acquisition of sbtech, a company from the isle of man (near the uk) founded in 2007 that has 12+ years of experience providing online sports betting platforms to clients all over the world. the acquisition occurred as part of the spac driven ipo in april of 2020 that combined “the old dk company” with sbtech so that they now are “the new dk company” listed as dkng on the nasdaq. sbtech is a far more important part of the story than just being 18% of today’s revenue. the reason for this is because dk will eventually (planned mid-late 2021) be migrating all of their dfs and gambling offerings onto sbtech’s online platforms. currently, for dfs, dk uses their own proprietary platform but that will move to sbtech with the migration. currently, for online gambling, dk uses kambi, the same online gambling platform that services penn gaming (penn), a dk rival. but that’s enough about the software migration for now, back to the gaming software revenue.the gaming software revenue stream for dk is essentially a continuation of sbtechs’ b2b business model. dk contracts with business customers to provide sports and casino betting software solutions. dk typically enters two different type of arrangements with b2b customers when selling the gaming software:&amp;#x200b;1. **direct customer contract revenue:** in this type of transaction, the software is sold      directly to a business (casino for example) that wants to use the software      for their own gambling operations. this revenue is generally calculated as      a percentage of the wagering revenue generated by the business customer      using dk’s software and is recognized in the periods in which those      wagering and related activities conclude.2. **reseller arrangement revenue:**  in this type of transaction, dk provides      distributors with the right to resell dk’s software-as-a-service offering      to their clients, using their own infrastructure. in reseller      arrangements, revenue is generally calculated via a fixed monthly fee and      an additional monthly fee which varies based on the number of gaming operators      to whom each reseller sub-licenses dk’s software.  as mentioned above, sbtech was an international company based in the isle of man before being acquired by dk. thus, the majority of their business in their first 12 years of operating independently has always been international and outside of the united states. this has helped dk, which has historically been us focused, expand it’s international reach.a perfect example of expanding this international reach occurred recently during october (technically q4) in which dk’s b2b technology (powered by sbtech) helped enable the launch of “palacebet”, a new mobile and online sportsbook offering from peermont, a south africa based resort and casino company. the deal was headed by dk’s new chief international officer, shay berka, who previously spent 10 years working for sbtech as cfo and general manager. mr. berka took on the role of dk’s chief international officer upon the merger in april earlier this year. i think this deal shows that dk has integrated sbtech and it’s business very well into the larger business as a whole. they are not wasting any time using their newly acquired resources to expand their reach and bring in new sources of revenue.this is the end of my first article about dk. my goal is to drop part 2 later this week. the focus of part 2 will be an in depth answer of the question – “can we 10x from here?”**disclosure:** i am/we are long dkng. i wrote this

4505,"background: i've published peer-reviewed journal articles on china's politics and markets before. alibaba (and ant)'s getting pulled into a meeting with regulators today on the heels of a new anti-trust probe. expect a correction, but much of the uncertainty had already been priced in. a quick sentiment analysis of the press releases from chinese government mouthpieces like《人民日報》\[the people's daily\] shows their tone is much more mellow now than before. where before they hawked on ma and alibaba, they're now focusing on “the country’s focus on the healthy development of the platform economy in china”. this talking point is repeated a significant number of times in the releases. this stark shift in tone suggests regulators already have a for-show compromise in mind and baba will only need to kiss the ring when they meet with said regulators today. it also suggests regulators are putting on this show for political grandstanding to send a message to digital companies and the billionaire class to do the same. to put this into an even broader context, this episode is just the latest in a chest-puffing government campaign going on over the last couple of years to stress deference to the ccp. china's state-run banks have dragged their heels in performance for a while, and ever since private-sector digital platforms (baba, jd, meituan, tcehy) have forged ahead in innovating much more efficient payment systems, the ccp felt left behind and wanted to be included in the party. what's key is we’ve observed this campaign to be much more discursive and cultural in practice and effect (e.g. prodding individual people and companies to be more humble and thank the party, put on the frills, yaddi-yadda) than it has been economic (e.g. quashing entire companies). why? and where are we headed? baba and the digital platform economy it's a leader in are essential to china. the ccp has been ramping up efforts to digitalize in a bid to take a lead in the global (fin)tech race and strengthen the yuan at the same time. the innovation of the new china digital currency is a game-changer. the bank of china filed over 70 patents related to the digital currency in the past year. the patents will likely be approved 2021, which will be baba's time to shine because the ccp will need the networks and infrastructure of alipay to make the digital currency a success. more bullish sentiment: in q3 2020, close to 1800 hedge funds/financial institutions had baba in their holdings, over 200 opened new positions, and \~700 added to their positions. bigger names who bought more over q3: cathie woods' ark, ray dalio's bridgewater, morgan stanley, fidelity, barclays, susquehanna, deutsche, canada pension plan, etc. it remains blackrock's #8 holding and has become bridgewater's #4 holding. my take: buy and hold. i literally bought more yesterday and i intend to keep buying.",105,1,A China expert on BABA: Bullish,Finance
4577,"hi everyone! i am working non-stop provide the best research and analysis regarding draftkings (nasdaq: dkng). i originally posted my overall investment thesis on the company a few weeks back and now i am breaking down and analyzing the latest news and developments regarding dkng! and no, it is not the ticker symbol for donkey kong.draftkings in my opinion, is the best pure play investment if you want some exposure to the sports betting, igaming, and daily fantasy sports space. they're founder led (3 founders to be exact) and they're invested into the company themselves right alongside all of us shareholders or potential shareholders.within the last week, there has been some exciting developments regarding draftkings. i will share them below:**dk gift cards are live! you can buy a dk gift card as a stocking stuffer for christmas if you want.**i’m really excited to hear this news. it’s only going to increase the  brand awareness of dk and that’s what we want. according to the press  release on dk’s investor relations website, they’ve partnered with  incomm payments to facilitate the launching of the gift cards. incomm  payments is a global leading payments technology company that has a  network of retailers that dk will be able to leverage through this  partnership.  convenience stores like 7-eleven, speedway and dollar  general are just some of the many convenience stores in incomm payments’  network that dk will be able to leverage. for now, the gift cards will  be offered in $50 and $25 denominations.the great thing about this to me is that they’ve beat their  competitors to this. that shows managements initiative and ability to  get things done which i complimented when i first picked this company.  as of right now, you’re not going to be seeing any “fanduel” (boo  fanduel \*thumbs down emoji\*) gift cards in the stores. tim richardson,  the senior vice president at incomm payments was quoted as saying  “draftkings will benefit from having its brand present in tens of  thousands of incomm payments’ retail partner locations across the us”.  overall, good news for dk.**new york state – getting desperate? do they need some online sports gambling revenue?**i want to make this clear before i write about this topic – sports  betting is already legal in new york state. the problem is, it’s only  legal in brick and mortar (retail) locations. just under a dozen upstate  casinos can operate brick and mortar sports books at the moment. in  typical dk fashion, they’re already active in a casino in new york  state. dk offers in person brick and mortar sports betting through the  del lago resort casino in waterloo, ny.  my news update i’m sharing is  that it appears new york state might be considering expanding to online  sports betting too due to a budget shortfall they’re experiencing (they  need more tax revenue).this news came out on wednesday, 12/16/20 during the day time.  governor cuomo had a press conference during the day. the press  conference was primarily focused on giving an update on the covid-19  pandemic in new york state. during the presser, the topic of new york  state’s budget shortfalls came up. as a possible financial solution,  cuomo said “are there other ways to get revenue? how about marijuana?  how about sports betting?” he’s referring to the possible tax revenue  that could be collected if sports betting offerings were expanded beyond  just the brick and mortar offerings. what if every new yorker could  place a sports wager from the comfort of their own home on their cell  phone?the battle for legalizing online sports gambling in new york has been  going on for years. governor cuomo has always been opposed to it. one  of the reasons gov. cuomo has cited in the past is that he thinks a  constitutional amendment would need to be made to new york state law to  allow for mobile sports betting in the state. however, one state  representative from new york that has been pushing hard for online  sports gambling begs to differ. in response to cuomo’s comments in the  presser earlier that day, state senator joseph addabbo said that there  would be no constitutional problem with mobile sports betting because  the servers could be placed on site of grandfathered in physical  casinos. addabo said that new york state’s need for revenue is “real and  immediate”this is a situation to keep a close eye on. the impacts of legalizing  mobile sports betting in ny would be substantial for dk as it would  open the population of 20 million people in ny state the opportunity to  place wagers on the dk sportsbook app through the comfort of their home.  i imagine it wouldn’t be too difficult for dk to mobilize once they get  the green light for mobile betting as they already have the standing  relationship with del lago resort casino for in person betting.**the michigan gaming control board (mgcb) granted dk a  provisional license to conduct online gaming and sports betting in the  state of michigan**for this update i also want to be clear – retail (brick and mortar)  and mobile sports betting are already legal in the state of michigan.  it’s just that there’s a lot of yellow tape for sportsbooks like dk to  navigate within a state even after sports betting has become legalized.  this provisional license provided by the mgcb was provided to dk and 14  other sportsbooks (including rival fanduel) on thursday, december 10th  last week.now there are just a few more regulatory requirements that dk has to  meet in the state of michigan before they can go live. according to [http://www.michigan.gov](http://www.michigan.gov/),  “before launch happens, the platform providers must complete additional  regulatory requirements including independent testing of platforms and  games and mgcb approval of their internal controls, which ensure gaming  integrity. the firms also must secure occupational licenses for certain  employees.” you can read the full article on michigan’s government  website [here](https://www.michigan.gov/mgcb/0,4620,7-351-79256_98027_97974-547154--,00.html).knowing that dk has a knack for being quick to mobilize once they’re  given opportunities in respective states, i fully expect them to pass  these last few tests with flying colors. the dk sportsbook app has  already been available in the state of michigan for “free to enter”  games. once they pass the last few requirements, actual wagers will be  allowed to be placed. and money will be allowed to be made!another promising sign coming out of the state of michigan, is that  on november 30th, 2020, dk became an official sports betting partner of  the detroit pistons, the nba basketball team in michigan. dk chief  business officer, ezra kucharz, was on the record after the deal closed  saying “as our first professional team activation in the state of  michigan, we are thrilled to join forces with the detroit pistons ahead  of our pending market introduction”. in my opinion, i anticipate we’ll  be seeing dk online sports betting in michigan some time in early 2021.this concludes my update and analysis on draftkings.**tl:dr*** draftkings now offers gift cards and you can buy them in convenience stores (first sports betting company to do so)* draftkings received a provisional license to conduct sports gambling in michigan* governor cuomo of ny said he would consider legalizing ""mobile sports betting"" to raise additional tax revenue* if you would like to read my original deep dive and analysis on dkng, you can check it out here:   * [draftkings deep dive and analysis - investment thesis](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2020/11/30/deep-dive-1-part-1-of-2-draftkings-bringing-sports-to-life/)",20,2,DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG) - Deep Dive Research,Finance

4697,"with 2020 over, i decided to look at the regional geographic distribution of north america's ""mega"" cap corporations ($50b+ market capitalization) by headquarters.here's the graphic i made laying that out: [https://i.imgur.com/t37bqwc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/t37bqwc.jpg)north america has 152 mega cap companies, 145 in the united states and 7 in canada. mexico has 2 companies right on the cusp (walmex at $49b and america movil at $49b), but misses the cusp. maybe next year.these 152 companies have a market cap of $27.06 trillion. 97.7% is in the usa. 2.3% is in canada.to be clear, these companies are grouped based on the location of their headquarters, aka where high-level executive decisions are made (where ceo/president/chairman/board/executive management generally resides). of course, these companies have multinational operations and their workforce is spread throughout.some thoughts:* the u.s. gained $5.586 trillion in mega cap market value in the past year. canada gained $97 billion. north america gained $5.683 trillion total.* the west coast had a banner year due to covid pandemic and general inertia. with 56.6 million people (of north america's 580 million, or 9.8%) it is now home to 46 companies who combined have 52.4% of north america's mega cap market value. last year, these 145 companies had a market cap of $21.4 trillion, and the west coast had 42.4% of the share. so the west coast captured 10% of the mega cap ""market share"" in one year.* mega cap market value increased by 26.79% in the united states and 18.34% in canada. in both cases, the increase was due to tech growth. in canada, shopify's growth alone makes up nearly the entirety of canada's growth. shopify went from not being mega cap ($46b) on january 1, 2020, to having a market cap of $137 billion a year later, or 198% growth. if you exclude shopify from canada's listing, canada's mega cap only grew by 1.24%, showing how countries without competitive tech industries will fall behind in the coming decade. if shopify can continue to grow in the coming years, it will do wonders to shift canada's mega cap value away from dying (energy) and stagnant (finance) industries.* the same tech shift was noticeable throughout the u.s. the west coast's mega cap market value increased by a whopping 52.9% from $9.067 trillion to $13.863 trillion. tesla alone added $593 billion of market capitalization, or nearly the entire mega cap value of canada. the rest of the u.s. had mixed growth. the great lakes and southeast had 12.75% market cap growth and 12.80% market cap growth, respectively. the northeast, heavy on traditional industries and finance, only grew by 4.56%. the southwest declined by 5.32% due to the oil shock and exxon's market cap collapse.* of the 7 north american companies among the top 10 globally, we have the following growth:     * alphabet: +$264 billion market cap growth   * amazon: +$714 billion market cap growth   * apple: +$968 billion market cap growth   * berkshire hathaway (the only non-tech): -$8 billion market cap growth   * facebook: +$193 billion market cap growth   * microsoft: +$482 billion market cap growth   * tesla: +$593 billion market cap growth   * **total: +$3.206 trillion*** as the numbers above show, the 7 companies above grew by $3.206 trillion. so these 7 alone account for 57.4% of the u.s. gain, and 56.4% of north america's. they also account for 67% of the west coast increase just due to sheer size, even if smaller tech companies had much better percentage growth rates than all but tesla.* two companies ipod straight into mega cap territory: airbnb and snowflake. both are seriously overvalued and i can't imagine them sustaining those levels.* if 2021 is a year of recovery, i could also see a correction, with money being pulled from the safety of big tech back into traditional industries. so next year's snapshot might be far less imbalanced than the +53% west coast, +5% northeast dynamic we had this year.* hq relocations are a big question mark. this year alone, charles schwab and oracle moved their hqs to texas (though the former's isn't final final until january 21). if paypal or tesla move to texas in 2021, the west coast dominance could be reduced even further.any other thoughts?",6,1,North American Mega Cap Company HQs by Geographic Distribution and Market Cap Growth 2020-2021,Finance

think the topic for today's discussion is probably the single most important one for all of us, as the answer to the question would determine whether we should even trade in the markets at all.why would we ever trade individual stocks, commodities, or other assets if we can't actually ""beat the market""? the market meaning the s&amp;p 500 index or the dow for those based in the us.i know this will likely spark lots of criticism and intense discussions. i know a person who publishes investor letters has even gotten a death threat for saying something in his newsletter, also the reason why i'm staying private and anonymous.therefore, let me preface it with a few points first.\- this is solely my personal opinion.\- your opinion is just as good as mine.\- full disclosure, i haven't worked as a portfolio manager at an institution so i certainly lack lots of experience in managing money compared to those who make a living out of managing pension or endowment money.\- it's completely fine if you disagree. my goal is not to convince you but to help provide resources for people. the more you know the better.\- i believe that an ""average person"" would be far better off investing in the market index, just as warren buffett said.\- i agree with the academics, investors, and communities that most people shouldn't try to beat the market as most simply don't have enough time to analyze and monitor companies or have the discipline to stay invested in their ideas.\- investing is a game of probability, just like poker. this fund is ""more likely"" to beat the market means the fund has a high chance of beating the market, not ""will"" beat the market.if you have a pair of aces in a poker game, you wouldn't necessarily win the pot but you have a ""high probability"" of winning the pot.people say poker is a game of luck but there are professional poker players who win over a period of time. i believe the same is true in investing. not necessarily ""professionals"" but any investor can beat the market with the right amount of discipline and research.\- timing the bottom or top is impossible. but it is possible to guess the top or bottom with a probability. for instance, at the end of 2019, was it more likely that we were near the top of the market cycle or bottom? the answer is obvious.now with all that said, i'll say the unpopular opinion.yes, we can ""beat the market"".more specifically, i believe it is possible to beat the s&amp;p 500 net of fees even over a long period of time, say 20-30 years, for those with less than $50 million in the portfolio.here are my arguments for today's topic.**1) it is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.****2)** **while it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. they are discipline and conviction.****3) security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. for instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, ev, and cleantech will be the future.****1) it is possible to beat the market with a small portfolio as an individual investor.**but beating the market isn't enough. you have to consistently beat it, for 5 years, 10 years, and 30 years.i'm sure most of you know that a 1% difference in the 30-year annual return can make a huge difference at the end of the 30-year period due to compounding.what most probably don't know is the distribution of those returns from a portfolio point of view.if you make an annual rate of 15% return over the course of 30 years, that doesn't mean you need to make 15% of return every single year in practical terms.what's happening is that over the course of 30 years, you will make 200% returns, 100% returns 60% returns in the early part of the 30 years, and then slowly decline to 5% annual returns, which altogether make 15% annual return over the course of 30 years.theoretically, any investor's portfolio will look something along the lines of this over a time period.(images are not allowed here. please go to the original post to see the graph.)[https://www.reddit.com/r/midasinvestors/comments/kpfx3h/investing\_philosophy\_part\_iii\_can\_you\_actually/](https://www.reddit.com/r/midasinvestors/comments/kpfx3h/investing_philosophy_part_iii_can_you_actually/)📷the total compounded annual return is 15%, not the actual annual returns.this makes sense because, with a $50k portfolio, you will obviously be more concentrated in positions compared to a $50mm portfolio. therefore, you are taking more ""risk"" in a smaller portfolio.similarly, berkshire hathaway, the conglomerate run by warren buffett, has posted annual returns that look somewhat similar.📷if you noticed, the standard deviations are much larger in the earlier part of the years compared to the latter part of the years when the portfolio simply got too big to take that much risk.in fact, the standard deviation of the returns for the first 20 years is 42% compared to 16% in the last 20 years.**where i'm getting at is it is much easier to beat the market by a wide margin with a small-sized portfolio than a large portfolio and therefore, retail investors have a good chance of beating the market, given an appropriate knowledge and discipline.**it may be common-sense but to reiterate, it is much easier to double a portfolio of $500k than to double a $50 million.you may think the reason is that you're taking larger risks on smaller portfolios than larger portfolios.it is true that risks are larger. however, it also depends on how you define ""risk"".standard deviations are obviously larger in a smaller portfolio since your absolute size is smaller and therefore, you can't diversify as much.but standard deviations aren't truly the ""risk"" of a company going under. the true risk of a company going bankrupt is the liquidity, cash flow, and business profile. even with a concentrated portfolio, i believe it's possible to get large returns with limited ""risks"" as retail investors.now, to reduce those idiosyncratic ""risks"" of businesses, we need to apply our ""knowledge"" and ""discipline"".which brings to my second argument.**2)** **while it is possible to beat the market as an individual investor, two traits are essential for an investor to win. they are discipline and conviction.**most people will sell at lows and buy at highs. we sell at lows because once a stock goes down, our cognitive bias kicks in, called the loss aversion bias. we put more weight on losing $100 than gaining $100 and thus, losing money has more impact on us than gaining money.this is due to evolutionary psychology and there's a good reason why we were evolved this way but that's a topic of conversation for another day.we also buy at highs because we tend to follow the herd, getting into the hype of trends and manias. fear of missing out (fomo) is a strong incentive for people to get in on the ev hype.people at cocktail parties will brag about their 4x returns on bitcoin or tesla, which will prompt you to buy them the next day.buying at highs and selling at lows are due to a lack of discipline, as the famous investors put it.this is also the reason why professionals say ""invest in what you know"". if you invest in what you don't know, then you will be tempted to sell when stocks go down because you don't know the company and don't have such a high conviction that it will recover.as an analogy, i have seen many people make new year's resolutions as losing weight or saving more money to buy a house.why is it so hard to do both?in fact, all of us actually know how to lose weight: eat less and exercise more. burn more calories than you consume. it's as simple as that.we also know how to increase the balance on our bank account. spend less than what you earn, or increase your earnings through side-gigs.it doesn't take a genius to figure out the solutions to these problems. i believe the same is true for the markets. people generally know which companies will be better off in ten years (disney, amazon, jp morgan, etc.).so why do people lack the discipline to stick to their plans?again, there's a good evolutionary reason which i won't get into in this post.if amazon fell 30% today and stayed there fore the next month or two while other ev companies rose 50% in the same time period, most people would be tempted to sell their amazon and buy those ev companies, hence the ""sell low buy high"" phenomenon.take this analysis shown on wsj.**the returns of a hypothetical investor who put $10,000 into an s&amp;p 500 index fund at the start of 1980 and missed the market’s five best days through the end of august 2020 would be 38 percentage points lower than those of someone who stayed invested the whole period, according to a fidelity investments inc. analysis.**this is the significance of self-discipline, the ability to weather through the tough times, or carefully ride the trends.to gain self-discipline, we need a high conviction. to have a high conviction, we need to do enough research and have a sufficient understanding of the assets we are buying.as long as we understand that this company will thrive with a high probability, we will more likely to hold onto those positions even in a recession.**in order to beat the market as an individual investor, we need self-discipline. self-discipline comes from a high conviction. high conviction comes from enough research and understanding of the security.****security analysis leads to -&gt; high conviction leads to -&gt; self-discipline****3) security analysis doesn't require a rocket scientist. for instance, it's not hard to know e-commerce, ev, and cleantech will be the future.**i'm certainly not saying analyzing individual companies is easy but as an individual investor who lacks the resources and knowledge about a company, it's still possible to know that a company is a fundamentally strong business trading at a reasonable multiple.for instance, fiverr is an israeli company that allows freelancers to offer their services on its platform. it has grown its sales at more than 40% annually with at least 75% gross margin. would you expect this sort of company to continue growing in the next five to ten years or go bust?and yes it's trading at too high of a multiple, at 43x ltm p/s.but think of it this way. if fiverr grows its sales at 40%, 40%, 30%, 30%, and 30% in the next five years and has a 25% net margin, it'll have $175mm in net income after five years. with a trading multiple of 70 p/e you get $13b market cap in five years, compared to $6.8b market cap right now.yes, these are rosy assumptions but i don't need to convince people that a platform with freelancers will only grow in the future.many also argue that you can’t win in the market because there are too many big-money professionals and the person on the other side of the trade knows better than i do.i absolutely agree with that. but it's not a winner-takes-all game.there doesn’t have to be a single winner. professional trader's win doesn't mean our loss.you don’t need those terminals and market data to predict that the stay at home stocks would have outperformed the value stocks since march.you don’t have to be a genius to know that china will be the next big player in the world or that chinese companies are poised to outperform maybe some other foreign competitors.the important aspect to remember is that the retail investors can easily come to the same conclusion as a professional analyst who has spent thousands of hours on research.the key differences between the professionals and us is the amount of work the professionals put in and the vast amounts of resources they have, both of which lead to higher conviction (therefore, self-discipline) and informational advantage.that’s why people like peter lynch and buffett likes to say invest in what you know.by only dealing with what we are familiar with (easy-to-understand companies), we don’t need to use capiq or bloomberg to come to a high conviction that e-commerce will only grow in the future.if however, we were to take a stab at a company like exxon mobil, we need to know how much of their production volumes are hedged, at what oil price are their rigs economical, how will commodity prices impact the stock performance (you need historical correlation data and regression for different time periods), and so on.take bond futures. it’s not that hard to know that as long as the treasury is issuing more than the fed is buying, there will be a supply overrun and yields will likely go up (of course it's not as simple as that because you need to take into account numerous other factors like inflation and real yields but i'm making a point here). but i only can monitor that from the numerous data points provided by the sell-side research.the more complicated analyses are where professional investors have an edge.**to summarize today's post in one sentence, it is possible to beat the market with a small-sized portfolio given a sufficient amount of discipline.**please feel free to use this post as a starting off point when arguing with your friend about beating the market.hope everyone has a great rest of the weekend and thanks for

4849,"greetings to all who read this,today i am sharing some due-diligence i recently did on $qs. qs has been a hot stock in recent months having made large moves, both up and down. they also entered the market as a spac and as they are intensely research-based, have no prior financials worth noting. so this dd post focuses on their innovation and their management and recent news. i hope you all enjoy it and look forward to any discussion!&amp;#x200b;**quantumscapes due diligence (5th jan)**intro to qs: "" quantumscape corp. engages in the provision of energy storage solutions. it focuses on the development of solid-state lithium-metal batteries for use in electric vehicles. the company was founded by jagdeep singh, tim holme, and fritz b. prinz in may 2010 and is headquartered in san jose, ca. ""&amp;#x200b;*first i checked their ratings and trend summary on* [*stockinvest.us*](https://stockinvest.us)*. here is what i found:*· rated as sell on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) (changed to buy on the 6th jan)· trending search for the day/week though (bullish - investor sentiment shows hype and interest)* “qs stock risk:this stock may move very much during a day (volatility) and with a very large prediction interval from the bollinger band this stock is considered to be ""very high risk"". during the last day, the stock moved **$13.60** between high and low, or **28.69%**. for the last week, the stock has had a daily average volatility of **17.36%**.our recommended stop-loss: **we hold a sell evaluation for this stock. no stop-loss set.""**· volume has increased on the 4th (of january) by 69 million shares but on falling prices.· given the current short-term trend, the stock is expected to rise **185.84%** during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between **$142.81** and **$406.18** at the end of this 3-month period.&amp;#x200b;*next i checked motley fool (although i have no confidence in their analysis overall), to see what they had to say:*· quantumscape is several years from commercial production, and its current [market capitalization](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-is-market-cap/) is still over $18 billion. investors who want to speculate on the potential of quantumscape and its business need to plan on a lot of volatility in the years leading up to its technology going to market.· investors have jumped in, excited about the potential, but quantumscape will soon have a lot more shares trading. the company updated an s-1 filing at end of december registering more than 300 million shares, with at least 60 million not subject to any lockup agreement and able to be sold as soon as the filing gets the rubber stamp from the securities and exchange commission.· more shares available typically means downward pressure on a stock. in this case it is existing holders, and not the company, selling shares, meaning quantumscape would get no cash from the offering. but existing shares could feel some near-term downward pressure (which they have since mid-late december).· we'll likely know when the registration becomes official (probably sometime january) when we see a spike in the volume of shares traded and probably another down day for the shares (likely the increase in volume and decrease in price mentioned on [stockinvest.us](https://stockinvest.us) on the 4th). it's hard to read too much into options pricing, but if options are to be believed some investors are pricing in the potential for the stock to lose $20 or more in the weeks to come.· quantumscape was a breath of fresh air as it hit the public markets after its [reverse merger](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/13/why-kensington-capital-is-charging-higher-today/) with kensington acquisition corp. in november.· quantumscape, in partnership with **volkswagen**, expects to begin construction of a 1-gigawatt hour (gwh) pilot facility in 2021. if successful, quantumscape will expand the project to a 20-gwh facility. to put this in perspective, consider that in mid-2018 tesla reported that battery production of its gigafactory in nevada achieved annualized battery production of about 20 gwh.· while management foresees the company reporting $275 million in revenue and $73 million in gross profit for 2026, quantumscape estimates that the following year, the top line and gross profit will skyrocket to $3 billion and $1 billion, respectively. likewise, the company believes that 2027 will be the year it starts to report positive [ebitda](https://www.fool.com/knowledge-center/ebitda.aspx) \-- approximately $808 million.·  since 2012, volkswagen has provided more than $300 million in funding to quantumscape, making it the company's largest investor -- though it maintains a minority stake. in 2018, volkswagen and quantumscape formed a 50/50 joint venture, one of the goals of which is to produce solid-state batteries for volkswagen's evs on a mass scale.· thanks to the joint venture and pilot facility, quantumscape envisions that volkswagen will be the first to commercialize its solid-state batteries. but quantumscape demonstrated in a recent filing that its dance card is hardly full, stating that ""subject to the other terms of the joint venture arrangements, we are not limited from working in parallel with other automotive oems to commercialize our technology.""· while quantumscape is singularly focused on developing its solid-state batteries for evs, the company recognizes that its technology may be used in other applications, such as stationary storage, smartphones, and wearables. while the company may, in time, pursue the latter two markets, it seems that stationary storage is closest to the company's current focus; moreover, it's one that certainly represents a significant opportunity. according to lux research, the stationary storage market, which represented installations of 164 gwh in 2019, is expected to grow at a 20% compound annual growth rate through 2035, when it will reach installations totaling 3,046 gwh.· apple has a [mountain of cash](https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/cash-is-king/), and one could speculate that it would acquire a company with the right technology. quantumscape highlighted its technology in a presentation earlier this month. the solid-state technology charges to 80% capacity in just 15 minutes, has greater than a 300 mile range, has a long usage life, and is non-combustible.· the company is notably backed by both **volkswagen** ([otc:vwagy](https://www.fool.com/quote/otc/volkswagen-aktiengesellschaft/vwagy/)) and bill gates. whether investors are speculating about an apple investment is anyone's guess. moves could also be driven by thinking that other potential customers will want to partner with quantumscape if they have to compete against an apple ev.&amp;#x200b;*after this, i went to simply wall st. to get an overview of management and financials:*## ·shahmoon keller pllc files suit on behalf of holders of quantumscape corporation warrants· shahmoon keller pllc announced

desire.&amp;#x200b;my tl;dr:* overall bullish, the tech, if all data and results are true representations, is extremely advanced. it will be the future.* but production doesnt start until 2025 at the soonest. there have been accusations that the results and data were exaggerated, fabricated or whatever else usually follows success. ongoing investigations are likely to turn up nothing though.* management and the board overall are extremely experienced and likely trustworthy. they are and will continue to be the best they can be at what they do.* there are some extra shares floating around that may suppress price for a couple of weeks or so. and with a huge run up already after happening, it is unlikely to see another for a couple weeks/months again, minimum.* people are comparing it to tesla already. there are also some competitors, some of them chinese, some of them just other car companies, such as toyota and gm. also ev stocks in general are hot/are getting bad rep because of valuations.* in terms of technical analysis, i predict a big move upwards over the next few week/months.* long term (5+ years) this could go up 1,000% from current prices if they deliver on all their promises, and especially if they overdeliver. that would be extremely bullish.&amp;#x200b;also, as a side note, i want to give a special mention to cbat, another battery maker. all the hype surrounding ev's and battery companies could cause cbat to go on a huge bullish run. for reference, it is already up around 30% over the last week or so, and could easily rise another 100%+ from here,

5670,"alright, listen up clean energy bois.array technologies is a recent ipo solar play with a great fundamental product behind the stock. they provide hardware and software for solar tracking. it's essentially a single rotor rotating an entire row of solar panels on a solar farm, in order to track the sun's movements for optimal energy production. it's not a sexy vaporware technology, but it's damn efficient. check their website for a more in-detail presentation of their products.array is the #2 provider of tracking devices worldwide, but i can see them grow to become the market leader in the next few years. the leader is a subsidiary of solar flow and its exact delivery quantities and revenues can't be determined as they are mixed in with the rest of their financials.it doesn't take a foreteller to connect the dots for array's success. as solar energy is growing exponentially globally, the farms that harvest the energy will need to optimize the energy their panels can gather. array is a well-trusted american company that can help both public and private actors optimize their energy production.their growth-rate is in the **triple**\-digits, and their financials look rather stellar. again, take a glance at their financial statements for more in-depth analysis. they have no long-term debt and have $27 million in cash. oh, and the company is profitable despite of its rapid growth rate.their stock took a nosedive last week as one of the major stakeholders (hedge fund oaktree capital management) announced they were cashing out. they're selling 25mil. array shares, and might sell another 20-30mil. shares later. this represents 22.6% of the outstanding shares, so it's not a surprise that the market had a reaction to the announcement. however, this is not adding any new shares or diluting the existing amount of shares, it's literally just a hedge fund cashing out of their early investment. this sale will not result in raising any capital for array, but it's just literally one shareholder selling their shares.this dip was not a result of changing fundamentals, company operations news, analyst upgrades or -downgrades, share-dilution, or financial development. one could argue that the dip was entirely unjustified (i'd think it's just a hedge fund cashing out and looking for new opportunities, instead of some fundamental-breaking insider info), but i am for one, grateful for the buying opportunity.the stock sits at $36,57 as of writing this (under its ipo price). the stock was at 47$ just a few days ago. p/e is 36,63, p/s is 5,07, and the market cap sits at around $4,6 billion usd.as many of the solar plays have run-up (and for a reason) recently, some to some insane valuations, array represents a great opportunity for those betting on solar.it's still a new stock on the exchange so the stock could go up, down, sideways, or in circles, so i'm not going to give weather forecasts on this. but that being said, i see the stock as heavily undervalued for being a triple-digit growth company in the *green energy revolution* \-space. you could play this as a short-term bounceback with some great gains, or you can play long-term and hope for a multi-bagger. your move.positions: 350 shares at a $34,60 cost basis.",33,1,$ARRY - Array Technologies,Finance

19, 2021** **•** [**tracey longo**](https://www.fa-mag.com/author/2369/tracey_longo)president-elect joe biden’s promise to tax the wealthy may include a tax on dividends, something made easier now that democrats hold the house and the slimmest majority possible in the senate.the biden administration has called for those making more than $1 million to pay the same rate on investment income that they do on their wages. investment income includes dividends and capital gains.but an earlier biden plan for financing health-care initiatives indicates the new president will tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the new top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6% on income above $1 million and eliminate the step-up in basis that allows decedents to pass capital gains to heirs without taxes.advertisementthat means the top rate on long-term capital gains would nearly double from 23.8% to 43.4%. biden’s campaign cites a joint committee on taxation report on tax expenditures which estimates that the special lower rate on capital gains and dividends reduces federal revenue by $127 billion each, according to scott eastman, a policy analyst at the tax foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit.the change would have a significant tax impact on wealthy investors. “we estimate the plan would increase the average tax rate on capital gains from 19.1% to 27.7%, and the marginal tax rate on capital gains from 22.4% to 33.4%,” eastman said.while the revenue estimate implies that the government loses a lot of revenue from the lower rate on capital gains, it is “highly unlikely” the federal government could get this much revenue from just raising the rate, eastman cautioned. research from the congressional budget office (cbo) and the joint committee on taxation (jct) shows that taxpayer capital gains realizations are very sensitive to taxation.“this is because taxpayers can time when they want to realize their capital gains in order to minimize their tax bills,” eastman said. “specifically, the cbo and jct estimate that the elasticity of realizations to the tax rate is -1.2 in the short run and -0.79 in the long run. specifically, a 1% increase in the capital gains tax rate would result in a 0.79 to 1.2% drop in capital gains realizations.“in practice, this means that proposals to significantly raise capital gains tax rates, with no other changes, can lose federal revenue,” he added. “using cbo data on capital gains realizations and these elasticities, we estimate that raising the top rate to 43.4% could lose about $2 billion each year.”eastman said he arrived at that top rate by combining the 39.6% statutory rate plus the 3.8% net investment income tax.however, biden is not simply proposing to raise the top rate on capital gains. he also proposes eliminating step-up basis in capital gains. according to the jct, not taxing gains at death results in an annual loss of about $40 billion.again, this is a tax expenditure estimate and not a revenue estimate, and the amount of revenue biden’s proposal would ultimately raise would depend on how he structures the elimination of the step-up in basis, eastman said.biden “could require heirs to take on the decedent’s basis when they receive an asset, known as carryover basis, but still allow heirs to defer realization of that inherited asset’s capital gain,” eastman said. “this would raise much less than making death a taxable event—and even then, proposals to tax capital gains at death can have many exemptions.”it is also important to note how the two proposals interact. “since biden is raising the tax rate on capital gains, the value of the tax expenditure for step-up in basis will mechanically increase. this is because the rate at which these gains would otherwise be taxed at would be higher,” eastman said.in addition, eliminating step-up in basis at death reduces a taxpayers’ incentive to defer realizing gains. part of the reason why there is such a strong incentive to defer the tax on capital gains is that if an individual defers long enough, the tax on the asset will eventually be forgiven, eastman said.without step-up in basis, a taxpayer has a greater incentive to realize the gain during their lifetime. as such, eliminating step-up in basis can indirectly boost revenue from capital gains.while the plan will raise additional federal revenue in a progressive manner, it isn’t costless. raising taxes on capital gains would reduce the incentive to save by reducing the after-tax return to saving.“lower domestic saving leads to lower income for americans in the future and can lead to lower output by reducing domestic investment,” eastman said. “in addition, there are administrative, structural and transition issues that biden needs to consider if he ultimately eliminates step-up in basis,”while it is premature to make predictions about what biden and his democratic-majority congress will do, biden has stated plainly that he wants to raise tax revenues by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.“on a conventional basis, the biden tax plan by 2030 would lead to about 7.7% less after-tax income for the top 1% of taxpayers and about a 1.9% decline in after-tax income for all taxpayers on average,” according to tax foundation analysis.in addition to the potential new tax rates for those earning $1 million or more, biden’s plan also seeks to impose a 12.4% social security payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. this would create a “donut hole” in the current social security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed.=================",37,1,Biden may tax dividends and double the tax on long-term

5999,"hello all,  looking for some opinions on this more philosophical (and financial) problem i’m facing. a couple of months ago, i came across one of my all time favorite cars that wasn’t for sale, but looked badass and piqued my desire. i spoke with the owner who was in the limbo of “should i sell or not” and essentially shrewdly negotiated with him to get an insane deal on the car. i paid 22k for the car, and it’s legitimately worth around 33k (and appreciating).i liquidated some assets + has some cash to come up with the money and wrote the check. the car is freaking fantastic. i absolutely love driving it and it’s by far my favorite hobby. so here is my dilemma: should i keep the car and enjoy it, or sell it and generate 10kish profit and invest the 30k? i am working at a lean firm that is high growth and cash strapped, and right now i am being paid much at all (but enough to survive). the payoff, my anticipation, is in the next 1.5-3 years. until then, my income will be lower than average. my current net worth is about 60k + the car (33k). the majority of my capital is efficient and working, and invested in well performing assets (but only about 30% of it is liquid). my living situation is fine for me and am happy with quality of life. i have 0 debt and minimal fixed and variable expenses.pros of keeping:- i work laborious hours and my favorite escape is getting behind my car and driving, i usually spend most of my free time doing it. it brings me a ton of joy. - the car is cool, rare(ish) and an incredible networking tool (car looks a lot more expensive then what i paid) and i can use it to open more conversations/network. - these cars are notoriously reliable (with preventative maintenance) and it’s appreciating in value. i paid cash for it so the only real expense i have is opportunity cost. - you only live once and this feels like a quality of life thing.- it is liquid so in case of emergency i could generate cash quickly. pro selling:- i am considerably young to drive a car like this, and perhaps i should wait some time before i own a sports car (and when it is less than my net worth)- i have access to invest in assets that perform alpha much greater than market returns. 33k is still almost a 3rd of my net worth and could be used to invest and compound right now - there’s 10k + free profit sitting in the car that i haven’t realized - i wouldn’t be carless, my family has a spare, nice, reliable (albeit not fun) car that they said i can use.- the bet i’m taking too is based on my current position, i’ll be able to easier afford a similar car in a few years (albeit perhaps not the same great deal i got).i’ve been going back and forth on this, would love to hear some feedback from you guys.",3,1,Enjoy my favorite (appreciating) sports car or use it as compounding capital?,Finance

6055,"i've spent the last week and a half researching bitcoin mining, looking at financials, purchase orders, equipment, making spreadsheets, etc.  i don't see any possible world where &lt;1% of the bitcoin network hashrate is worth over $1b.even if $btc skyrockets, all mining companies are competing against each other, and the profit margins from mining automatically tend towards very little (because network hashrate explodes).  in other words, the cost basis for mining skyrockets in step.i'm wondering if i'm missing something here...happy to expand on this more if there's any interest.---**about mining**bitcoin mining is the process of buying specialized hardware (which has a hashrate), hooking it up to electricity, and getting back some amount of btc.  the amount of btc you get is:  **your hashrate** divided by **network hashrate** times **reward**.currently the reward is 1000 btc per day.  this halves every four years, so if you're a miner, get wrecked.  but anyway, just assume it doesn't half.now the amount of $ rewards you get is the above equation times the price of btc, or $usd.so to recap:  you spend $2400 to get hardware that gives you 100 th/s... the network hashrate is 150,000,000 th/s, so you get 1/1,500,000 of 1,000 btc per day (.0067 btc), times $30,000, that's $20/day.  pretty sweet, right?  you'll break-even in 120 days, and from then on out, it's all profit, right?---**race to the bottom**except, here's the golden rule of bitcoin mining:  **the more profitable it is to mine, the more the network hashrate grows**.  it's that simple.  miners collectively see it is profitable to mine, so they buy a **ton** of that hardware, and now the network hashrate will, for example, double... so you're netting $10/day instead of $20/day.this is how it works -- miners are all competing, adding hardware when it's profitable, and driving the profit margin down to the lowest point they can tolerate, given the volatility of $btc.there is nothing proprietary about mining, and there are no economies of scale.  there's nothing special about any miner's hardware -- they all buy it from one of a few manufacturers (bitmain, microbt, canaan, ebang, etc).  there's nothing special about electricity -- low cost electricity is available all around the planet.during the bull run of 2017, btc went from $1,000 to $14,000 -- but during that same period hashrate went from 2 eh/s to 16 eh/s -- so even though $btc exploding in value, the actual mining profit margins only increased a little bit.  by the end of 2017, the same hardware you had in jan would now mine 1/8th the amount of btc.  (the story got way worse in 2018)from my analysis i've concluded that on average **miners can hope for 1-2x return on their hardware investment across 2 years** -- by that time, the hardware has negative profit margin.  not bad.. but not worthy of $1b+ valuation.of this 1-2x, the vast majority of return comes from when the newest hardware is just released, and/or when there are spikes in $btc that happen faster than miners can provision new hardware.---**the arms race**all things being equal ($btc, network hashrate), there is another factor that guarantees network hashrate will go up -- and that is availability of new hardware.  for $2400 you could get 20 th/s... then a year later, 50 th/s.per the golden rule of mining -- if it's more profitable to mine, network hashrate goes up.  about every year the next generation of mining hardware is released and is much more profitable, so miners **must** upgrade to it or they'll be left in the dust as the network hashrate explodes. when the dust settles, they are still getting the same amount of btc, but have had to shell out $ for the new hardware.  nobody wins, except the hardware manufacturers.---**about riot**$riot is a publicly traded company at above $1b valuation.  they've done essentially nothing but hook up a few thousand hardware units and operated at a loss.they sell shares constantly to raise cash to pay for their losses and ridiculous salaries.  there is nothing special about their operations -- what they do happens on a scale 1,000x over across the world:  buy mining hardware, hook it up to electricity.throughout 2020 they ordered $83m in equipment which will trickle in throughout 2021... (which they'll have to do more share offerings to finance as their purchase orders require payment in various months).meanwhile, the rest of the mining world has done exactly the same, probably to the total tune of a few $billion in orders.  the miners in china will get their equipment in greater quantities, and earlier, and at better prices (no tariffs, cheaper shipping, etc).*if $83m purchase order for late-arriving, overpriced mining hardware (which will only amount to a tiny fraction of global hashrate) is worth $1b+ market cap... doesn't this impute a ridiculous valuation on the btc mining industry as a whole?---**litmus test**do you think that purchasing $50m in hardware (which will not arrive until later this year) somehow imputes a $1b valuation, when literally **$billions** of the same mining hardware were purchased by all other miners?do you think the manufacturers are too stupid to realize that they could be multi trillion dollar companies if they just announced they are going to mine with their hardware rather than sell it?do you think 1% of the network hashrate a year from now is worth $1b?  (btw, they will not even come close to 1%... network hashrate will have gone up 2-4x by then.)do you think $riot can compete against chinese miners that get preferred deals with manufacturers, get first dibs at newest hardware, get better deals, don't have to pay tariffs, don't have to wait for shipping, and use their precious [guanxi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/guanxi)?do you think that when $btc doubles, somehow all miners will **forever** make double the returns from their hardware?",210,1,Why are $RIOT and other bitcoin mining stocks overpriced?,Finance

how vital it is for us to get our personal finances together. i don’t want ya’ll to have the financial regrets the guy has in the video, hope this is worth your time. i need to get this off my chest because when i talk to my friends about investing, majority of them are a little afraid and make excuses like “i don’t trust or know anything about the stock market” or “investing in the market is like gambling”. i totally understand. we don’t want to put our hard earned money into something we don’t know but i promise you the time you put in now to research and learn will save you a significant amount of time and effort in the future.**what is a roth ira?**roth ira stands for roth individual retirement account. it’s a retirement account where money grows tax-free and withdrawals are tax-free. the money in the account is used to invest in the market, into stocks/funds of your choosing.a roth ira is an account, it’s not a stock/fund you invest in. it’s a retirement account where you put your money in in order to invest in something. in most states you can open an account yourself when you're 21. if you're 18 you can ask your parents to open a custodial roth ira.every year you can contribute up to $6000 ($7,000 if 50 or older). you can only withdraw the full amount when you’re 59.5 y/o, if you withdraw the full amount before 59.5 you will pay a large fee. you can withdraw the amount you contributed at any point. for example:i put in a total of $6000 in my roth ira in 2021 and invested all in apple. i put in another $6000 in 2022 and another in 2023 and invest it all in apple. i’ve contributed a total of $18,000. between 2021-2023 apple’s stock goes up by 20% so i now have $18,000\*1.20 = $21,600 (for people fluent in the markets i know this isn’t how it works because of compounding but i’m trying to simplify as much as i can). if i want to take this money out in 2024 and i’m below 59.5 y/o, i can take out the amount i contributed, $18,000. i cannot take out the amount i earned from apple’s stock, $3600, unless i pay a very high fee.**why a roth ira?**all the money you withdraw when you’re 59.5 y/o is tax-free, that means if you have $500,000 in the account, that’s all yours. if that same amount is in a regular taxable investment account and you’ll end up with at least $50,000 less. you can do a lot with $50,000.and trust me, $500,000 is a pretty realistic number to reach if you consistently put in $6000 every year until you’re 59.5 y/o. this is described in the “returns, illustrated” section below.**what should i invest in?**i’m not an expert and i’m not a licensed financial advisor. i will tell you what i’m doing but this is what i’ve assessed will work for me. make sure you do your own due diligence before investing. i put all $6000 into voo, the vanguard 500 index fund etf. an index fund is basically a portfolio of stocks gathered into 1 fund, like a basket of companies. i recommend beginning your investment journey with index funds as it helps diversify your portfolio. when you get more into investing you can assess good companies and buy individual stocks. i must emphasize this is just a recommendation, do as you please, i have no say in how you spend or invest. voo tracks the s&amp;p 500 which is the 500 largest companies in the u.s. and the average annual return since its inception in 1926 through 2018 is approximately 10%–11%.voo also pays an annual dividend of $5.30/share and this number grows every year. a dividend is the distribution of a portion of a company’s earnings to its shareholders. if i have 10 shares of voo, i receive $53 in a year in my sleep, without doing anything. this may not seem like much but this is where compound interest and exponential growth are so powerful. i reinvest all of the dividends i receive back into voo so that this money can make even more money. reinvesting dividends does not count towards the $6000 limit so i can contribute a total of $6053. if i have 1000 shares of voo i can almost double my contributions from the $5300 i receive in dividends with 0 effort.i take a very hands-off approach and leave my emotions out of investing in my roth ira. it’s

2008 with the subprime mortgage financial crisis and back in march 2019 with covid-19.if there’s a big drop, double-down. recessions present a huge opportunity to make significant returns. take your emotions out of investing, ignore all the click bait news saying “the market is going to completely collapse, this time is different!!!”, and look in the long-term. it will bounce back even stronger

6438," **tl:dr is at the bottom**hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.my   name’s mark and i’m an accountant with a passion for investing. about   two years ago, i used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the u.s. my goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.i’m a long-term investor. i   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  i’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  if you  want to learn more about this approach. i recommend reading the  book  “100 baggers” by chris mayer.**introduction**i’m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  smartsheet.  i’m always looking for investment ideas. i run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. one  of the best investment decisions i’ve made to date came  after i talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. shout out  to you celsius (celh)! with that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.in   the case of smartsheet, i became aware of the company through a stock   screener. i was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6b),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a  subscription  business model (saas). once i became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. the more i learned about smartsheet,  the more i  liked. management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. in different roles i’ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, i’ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. i will touch on this more  later in the  write up.another  positive signal i  got about smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. i  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. i was  watching an  interview on my phone with mark mader, the ceo of  smartsheet. my  girlfriend overheard the word “smartsheet” mentioned in  the video and  said “are they talking about the smartsheet with the blue  check mark?”. i  had to google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same smartsheet. i asked her how she knew about it.  she said “my  company just transitioned all of our work onto  smartsheet. i really love  it. our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  smartsheet.**the thesis statement**for   every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for smartsheet is as follows:*“smartsheet:   a leader in collaborative work management (cwm) software. as the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.”*i  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  smartsheet does. if  you go to smartsheet’s website and look at the  “about” page, you will  find their “about” statement which says  “smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.”  notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.in   my thesis statement, i mention that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm   software space. but how do i know this? well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named forrester conducted a study on the cwm   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, ui/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. i put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. as you can see, smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. let’s use our common sense for a second. at   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming saas company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? i think the   answer should be a resounding yes. but what about these other companies   on the list. let’s break them down 1 by 1:* workfront   was recently bought by adobe. if you want to invest in workfront,  you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of adobe. it wouldn’t  be a  pure play investment into the cwm space.* smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)* wrike is private* servicenow   – cwm is just one small piece of their total      offerings. investing   here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.  also, the company  is  already quite large ($106b market cap)* asana   is public but just ipo’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. we don’t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the cwm space, they’re not a leader and rank behind smartsheet in   several of forrester’s categories. why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?* monday.com is private* microsoft – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.* atlassian   – this company does primarily focus on cwm but i have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) they’re ranked way beneath  smartsheet.  2) they’re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58b).now   that we’ve established that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm space  and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. other  than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?well,   let’s take a look at this quote from mark mader, smartsheet ceo,  during  the last earnings call (q3 fy21) that occurred on december 7th,  2020:“leaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. they understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.”key word here: asynchronous. asynchronous communication is different from synchronous communication. here is the difference:asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.any   communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. as   part of my research on smartsheet, i read an e-book that was written by   the original co-founders of smartsheet, mark mader the current ceo and   brent frei who is no longer with the company. they wrote the e-book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. the e-book is   called “the power of done”. the moral of the book is that mark and brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. this   is a quote from their e-book:“according   to basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire u.s.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the american economy.”they   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. the fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what mark and brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. they wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded smartsheet.**how smartsheet makes money**at   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that  i  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this  isn’t  to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things i  look at.before i  talk about the  revenue streams of smartsheet, i want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  co-founder/ceo mark  mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as microsoft excel. however,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. he wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. as a result, we now have  smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and gantt  view.the  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments.  what if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  that’s what smartsheet looks to achieve.for   smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. as i  mentioned  earlier, they are a software as a service (saas) company.  whenever you  see saas, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that’s a  very good thing. with a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.smartsheet’s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  collaborative work management (cwm) platform. customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   smartsheet by collaborating with a company/individual that uses   smartsheet.  for subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using smartsheet within minutes.smartsheet   offers four subscription levels: individual, business, enterprise, and   premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.the   connectors part of the business is something i find really  interesting.  basically, smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their smartsheet  user  interface. this helps position smartsheet as the true “command  center”  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. you’ll see this on the link above but some products  that  smartsheet sells connectors for include adobe creative cloud,  microsoft  dynamics 365, salesforce, jira software, slack, and skype  just to name a  few.i think that  being able to  sell these connectors as ancillary pieces to the  smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as “smartsheet  competitors” actually  become a piece of the smartsheet platform and can  be sold by smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. this neutral  angle that smartsheet is  able to come from by selling connectors to  their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how roku  (roku) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a netflix subscription on  their platform. i think just the  fact that all these big companies  like adobe, jira, salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with  smartsheet.on  top of the  connectors to third party vendors that smartsheet is able to  sell,  smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. for example, in may 2019, smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. the name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.also,   in september 2020, smartsheet acquired brandfolder, inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. combining  brandfolder capabilities  with smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. this  goes back to what i  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited  about smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” she told me  that before smartsheet, her company’s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. she said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and sharepoint.  now, all of the content is  inside of smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  they can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. the  acquisition of brandfolder is  really what allows smartsheet to stand  out in this department.nobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. the fact that smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with brandfolder is very promising. during smartsheet’s   fy21 engage customer conference, anna griffin, smartsheet chief   marketing officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500b   for companies around the world. she said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to editor in chief. all   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company’s brand. sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and r&amp;d is  teasing new product experiences in app. it can get  really difficult for  the company’s marketing/branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  brandfolder in smartsheet. this is just one reason why i  think  smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.as   you can see, smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  cwm platform, the connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and brandfolder. on top of that,  smartsheet  also provides workapps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. there are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  traditionally, companies need to engage their it  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. this  places a lot of strain on it departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. mark mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. he believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an it department employee who  doesn’t even do the job  that the app is being built for. also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on it departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.here   is a quote from the director of sales (hina patel) at a smartsheet   customer, cisco (nasdaq: csco): “i have been waiting for a solution like   workapps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,” said hina patel, director of sales   operations at cisco. “the ability to take our smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.” as you can  see, the  value proposition of workapps and the smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.lastly,  smartsheet also  generates revenue from professional services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the smartsheet platform. in the  most recent  quarter, q3 fy21, professional services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  here

6461,"**tl:dr is at the bottom**hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.my name’s mark and i’m an accountant with a passion for investing. about two years ago, i used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the u.s. my goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.i’m a long-term investor. i am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. i’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. if you want to learn more about this approach. i recommend reading the book “100 baggers” by chris mayer.**introduction**i’m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, smartsheet. i’m always looking for investment ideas. i run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. one of the best investment decisions i’ve made to date came after i talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. shout out to you celsius (celh)! with that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.in the case of smartsheet, i became aware of the company through a stock screener. i was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6b), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a subscription business model (saas). once i became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. the more i learned about smartsheet, the more i liked. management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. in different roles i’ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, i’ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. i will touch on this more later in the write up.another positive signal i got about smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. i was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. i was watching an interview on my phone with mark mader, the ceo of smartsheet. my girlfriend overheard the word “smartsheet” mentioned in the video and said “are they talking about the smartsheet with the blue check mark?”. i had to google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same smartsheet. i asked her how she knew about it. she said “my company just transitioned all of our work onto smartsheet. i really love it. our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” hearing this just motivated me to learn more about smartsheet.**the thesis statement**for every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for smartsheet is as follows:*“smartsheet: a leader in collaborative work management (cwm) software. as the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.”*i think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what smartsheet does. if you go to smartsheet’s website and look at the “about” page, you will find their “about” statement which says “smartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.” notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.in my thesis statement, i mention that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm software space. but how do i know this? well, a highly reputable independent research firm named forrester conducted a study on the cwm space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, ui/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. i put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. as you can see, smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. let’s use our common sense for a second. at the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming saas company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? i think the answer should be a resounding yes. but what about these other companies on the list. let’s break them down 1 by 1:* workfront was recently bought by adobe. if you want to invest in workfront, you’d have to invest in the much larger company of adobe. it wouldn’t be a pure play investment into the cwm space.* smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)* wrike is private* servicenow – cwm is just one small piece of their total      offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.  also, the company is already quite large ($106b market cap)* asana is public but just ipo’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. we don’t have much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company. furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the cwm space, they’re not a leader and rank behind smartsheet in several of forrester’s categories. why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?* monday.com is private* microsoft – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.* atlassian – this company does primarily focus on cwm but i have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) they’re ranked way beneath smartsheet. 2) they’re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58b).now that we’ve established that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm space and that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let’s understand why this is important. other than the obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?well, let’s take a look at this quote from mark mader, smartsheet ceo, during the last earnings call (q3 fy21) that occurred on december 7th, 2020:“leaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. they understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.”key word here: asynchronous. asynchronous communication is different from synchronous communication. here is the difference:asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc. synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc. any communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. as part of my research on smartsheet, i read an e-book that was written by the original co-founders of smartsheet, mark mader the current ceo and brent frei who is no longer with the company. they wrote the e-book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. the e-book is called “the power of done”. the moral of the book is that mark and brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. this is a quote from their e-book:“according to basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire u.s. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the american economy.”they mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. the fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what mark and brent referred to as the productivity paradox. they wanted to do something about it and thus they founded smartsheet.**how smartsheet makes money**at the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that i mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this isn’t to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things i look at.before i talk about the revenue streams of smartsheet, i want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. co-founder/ceo mark mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as microsoft excel. however, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. he wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. as a result, we now have smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and gantt view. the idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they’re hired to do – get work done. think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they’re at with their assignments. what if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? that’s what smartsheet looks to achieve.for smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. as i mentioned earlier, they are a software as a service (saas) company. whenever you see saas, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that’s a very good thing. with a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.smartsheet’s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based collaborative work management (cwm) platform. customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to smartsheet by collaborating with a company/individual that uses smartsheet.  for subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using smartsheet within minutes.smartsheet offers four subscription levels: individual, business, enterprise, and premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.the connectors part of the business is something i find really interesting. basically, smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their smartsheet user interface. this helps position smartsheet as the true “command center” platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. you’ll see this on the link above but some products that smartsheet sells connectors for include adobe creative cloud, microsoft dynamics 365, salesforce, jira software, slack, and skype just to name a few.i think that being able to sell these connectors as ancillary pieces to the smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as “smartsheet competitors” actually become a piece of the smartsheet platform and can be sold by smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. this neutral angle that smartsheet is able to come from by selling connectors to their perceived “competitors” reminds me a little bit of how roku (roku) is able to earn revenue off of selling a netflix subscription on their platform. i think just the fact that all these big companies like adobe, jira, salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn’t allow for their products to be integrated with smartsheet.on top of the connectors to third party vendors that smartsheet is able to sell, smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. for example, in may 2019, smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. the name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them. also, in september 2020, smartsheet acquired brandfolder, inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. combining brandfolder capabilities with smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. this goes back to what i said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company’s marketing team was “really excited about smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” she told me that before smartsheet, her company’s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. she said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and sharepoint. now, all of the content is inside of smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. they can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. the acquisition of brandfolder is really what allows smartsheet to stand out in this department. nobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. the fact that smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with brandfolder is very promising. during smartsheet’s fy21 engage customer conference, anna griffin, smartsheet chief marketing officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500b for companies around the world. she said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to editor in chief. all kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company’s brand. sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and r&amp;d is teasing new product experiences in app. it can get really difficult for the company’s marketing/branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like brandfolder in smartsheet. this is just one reason why i think smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.as you can see, smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core cwm platform, the connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and brandfolder. on top of that, smartsheet also provides workapps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. there are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. traditionally, companies need to engage their it departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. this places a lot of strain on it departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. mark mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. he believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an it department employee who doesn’t even do the job that the app is being built for. also, he believes this will reduce strain on it departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.here is a quote from the director of sales (hina patel) at a smartsheet customer, cisco (nasdaq: csco): “i have been waiting for a solution like workapps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,” said hina patel, director of sales operations at cisco. “the ability to take our smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.” as you can see, the value proposition of workapps and the smartsheet platform appears to be high.lastly, smartsheet also generates revenue from professional services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the smartsheet platform. in the most recent quarter, q3 fy21, professional services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:subscription revenue = $90,890m for 91.8% of total revenueprofessional services revenue = $8,043m for 8.2% of total revenuethis is the end of

6806,"i wanted to put my thoughts out here on some of the psychological factors spurring what we are seeing with tesla and crypto. some of these are relatively simple, others are much ""deeper"".feel free to disagree or add some of your thoughts.1: get rich quick attitude: social media has shortened peoples attention spans, especially the younger generations. when they think of investing/trading, they are almost certainly going to make their first attempt a ""get rich quick scheme"". after all, they have heard about other people striking it rich on tesla and bitcoin in prior years. (this is not the first hype cycle for either one). markets are being more driven by social media trends rather than fundamental values - at least in the short term. we used to be able to write this off because prices come back to fundamentals in the mid to long term, but the short term price impact of favorable social media trends has become larger and is now impossible to ignore.2: lockdowns/stimulus: there have been an enormous number of new and younger people beginning to invest/trade this year as they had more time from the lockdowns to learn about how markets work. a large percentage of them are in the ""get rich quick category"". pair that with unemployment and stimulus checks, and we get large inflows of money. tediously watching markets may be a way for some to cope with boredom during lockdowns.3: heightened global uncertainty: recent events of 2020 make the world seem like a much riskier place and the future muss less certain. why invest in ""safe"" stuff and eek out 3-5% returns, when nothing seems safe? everything seems risky, to a certain extent, as so much has changed in the last year. if everything seems risky, why not go for the riskiest stuff that is already going up and that you have heard others make money on? it is hardly the time for making trades that will take 2-3 years to work out. they want immediate results, and assets already rising quickly are the best candidate.4: fomo/not being left behind: under normal circumstances, maybe you can handle other people making a lot of $ from a random stock, but that assumes you are in a good position yourself and are occupied on a lot of other activities to distract you. we are now in a position where almost nobody feels ""safe"". they want to do whatever they can to feel safe, and if the best option seems to be attempting to strike it rich in the markets, why not? what can they lose if they are already in the mindset that everything is lost? in addition, a lot of people have more free time to mull around stocks when they can't go out to social events every evening. trading/investing, then, can fill this ""excitement void"". and what more exciting than the volatile high flyers?5: perceived/actual inequality: it is not enough to make enough $ to go on a nice vacation or buy a nice car. not when everyone is constantly bombarded with extremely rich and successful people on social media. jealousy/envy are making people jump into these ""moonshots"" as last ditch efforts to catch up to some impossible ""success ideal"". as a result, they put more $ in and hold stuff longer.",10,1,TSLA and Crypto Bubbles - 2020 Psychological Factors,Finance

(don't misunderstand nps with gps, where sls already got a license deal over with china.) if you already did dd on nps, you know these results are incredible and extremely effective. (i'll be giving a link to presentations of sls in history at the end of my post, where you can check the results yourself) first, we're going over the situation where the presentation isn't as quite as amazing as we all think. it will probably dip, you'll buy more cheap shares and you'll wait till next week. buy the dip and hold. we both know this is worth over 20+ (market cap now is 167 million, their deal with china is over 200 million. market cap is at least 200 million worth. small calculation: 17.66\* (200/167) = $21.15) and here i am just talking about the deal with china with licensing their gps. i haven't even talked about the value of the nps vaccine, the royalties of gps and all their other amazing medicines in their pipeline. secondly, the situation where it rockets to mars (i specifically like this scenario).  profits are profits, but don't sell too soon. this has still fuel in the tank and is still extremely undervalued. 3 days ago, we were at 448k volume, 2 days ago at 16 million volume and yesterday at an incredible 147 million. sell when you're gut feeling is telling you and don't look back at how much more profit you could have made, don't fomo into the spike.other guys buy the rumor and sell the news, which is also an excellent tactic, where they already sold yesterday or going to sell before the presentation. i, however, am extremely bullish on the whole company and call me crazy, but i do believe they have a chance to break glsi's ath. my reasoning behind it and here we go a little scientific: glsi has incredible results for their vaccine (0% recurrence rate), however this is only for women who are her2 3+. sls has a vaccine for patients who are hormone receptor-negative and her2 1+/2+. glsi also has no license deal yet, while sls has one with china worth 202 million. so i will hold when it dips and i strongly recommend buying extra shares if it does. if it goes to mars today and is going to halt multiple times today, i will consider selling the hype, but i will certainly get back in at a lower price again.good luck and let's make some money today :)&amp;#x200b;tldr; seriously recommended to read the whole stuff. for the people with no time or who read this just at market open: dipping, hold and buy more shares. wait till it hit at least 20+ (which won't be long at all). ripping, don't sell too soon and don't fomo. the only thing we have to do now is time the top :)&amp;#x200b;proof of still holding positions: [https://imgur.com/a/w1dp8q0](https://imgur.com/a/w1dp8q0)to easily find dd: click this link, which will get to you different pdf's about shareholders letters and previous presentations about results of their vaccines: [https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sellas+site%3as22.q4cdn.com&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=sellas+site%3as22.q4cdn.com&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web)",42,1,Presentation of SLS: The Play,Finance

(gurufocus)1. institutional ownership: 71% of shares held by institutions, 85% of float held by institutions. fyi, this was slightly lower during my purchase. i wanted to note institutional ownership for the following reason: the less institutional ownership, the greater the chance for a significant rise in price after proven profitability comes. (yahoo)1. d/e ratio: pre-pandemic was around 2 and declining consistently. as of end of sep, closer to 4. i can't imagine the d/e ratio not to drop off over the next couple of quarters. i wanted to mention d/e ratio specifically because of ftnt's in comparison to the rest of the industry. because the industry is still tech based, high debt is *very* common. the fact that this company, especially 20 years ago, already has a successful track record of obtaining debt for higher returns is especially encouraging when comparing their competitors. 1. peg ratio: at september's end, ftnt's peg ratio was .66, however it has increased to 1.16 as of today. again, this is absolutely *insane* when compared to other cybersecurity industry competitors. (gurufocus)1. there are many other metrics that could be listed here, both in favor of ftnt and against them, but the ones above are a handful that went into my secret sauce when comparing the company against its competitors. **subjective sentiment:** there have been huge catalysts that have helped boost ftnt recently. the covid pandemic, like most other tech related picks, has definitely boosted ftnt's ability to outperform. the 52 week low of $70 was robbery and unfortunately i was too late to buy in at that point. my actual buy in price didn't come until the stock hit $124 but i'm glad i did, even then. about a week later, it was announced that fireeye was hit by a malware attack, which further exploded into basically what's being referred to as the largest cybersecurity event in the last decade and maybe ever. the implications are reaching as far as the us gov't, foreign entities, and private businesses alike due to poor cybersecurity practices on behalf of the vendor solarwinds. i'm not going to get into the details on this attack, but with every passing year, more cybersecurity incidents arise. hacking is its own industry. cybersecurity is its opposite. as the hacking industry grows, as does cyber. this will *not* be a one time thing. if you are too concerned that you 'missed out' on a significant event and shouldn't even consider ftnt, you're gonna keep missing out on what fortinet will continue to prevent against.what i think is the most important piece of this short novel is the sentiment behind the company itself. i am not a ftnt customer, so i was unfamiliar with their level of success from the customer's perspective. how did i get an idea of the company? literally just reddit. it sounds insane, but it was tremendously helpful. subreddits like r/sysadmin and r/netsec was a gold mine for finding out how people feel about both fortinet, palo alto, and other competitors. and guess what, fortinet was all thumbs up. ""inexpensive and cheap"" was the mantra. palo alto, you ask? the cream of the crop when it came to the specific solution both companies were trying to solve, but expensive as heck. even after the fundamental analysis done above, i reasoned that *everyone* needs to start considering cybersecurity as a part of their core business expenses, but very few but the largest and mid size organizations are willing to put out cash for the ""ferrari of equipment"" from palo alto.**conclusion:**i could go on and on about fortinet. it checks all of my boxes and again, it's important for me to say that ftnt is something i'm going to hold for *a long* time. their leadership is killing it, they're performing when others are still figuring things out, and they still have incredible room to absolutely crush it in the industry. despite my position being up only 20% since november 30th, i'm absolutely stoked about the potential that fortinet has in the future.please provide criticisms &amp; feedback about ftnt because my strategy is based on examining all possible data &amp; information. it may not be relevant to me now, but keeping it in mind as i move forward with holding ftnt could prove fortuitous if things change. *disclaimer, i am long ftnt and i wish you good luck trying to change my mind.*",4,1,[DD] NASDAQ: FTNT,Finance

8002,"[spx monthly chart:](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/spx/7rpzyt3e-spx-monthly-risk-reward-less-favorable/)* the market basically closed the year at ath (3pts off) and is within a hair of 3855, which is the 138.2% fib of the march low.* the rising monthly channel (shown above) shows that markets are stretched near resistance and already outside of their bollinger bands. the weekly band is at 3774.* while i believe there is room for upside into 2021, the risk/reward is **not** favorable here anymore. sentiment is stretched and a correction would be welcomed with open arms.* i anticipate a 10-15% correction to start the year, which would align us with the rising 200dma near 3219. we ended the year in a tight range, and there is potential to carry into 3855 based on january 15 open interest and gamma positioning.last few days i have been selling stocks and calls aggressively in anticipation of a correction. i am long tlt calls (flat) and spy puts (down 37%).**sentiment:*** the aaii sentiment survey is quite elevated near multi-year highs and shows overly bullish sentiment.* the advisors sentiment report reports the views of over 120 independent investment newsletters (those not affiliated with brokerage houses or mutual funds) and reports the findings as the percentage of advisors that are bullish, those bearish and those that expect a correction. the current bull to bear spread is one of the highest in decades, yet another indication of frothy sentiment.* the naaim exposure index is currently at 89 and off some 100+ prints but remains elevated to the averages.* the baml fund manager survey shows the three most crowded trades are:     * long tech via shares   * short usd   * long bitcoin spot via perpetual swaps   * fund managers are ""all-in"" on leverage. this is evidenced by our dix print on thursday yet again showing dark pool buying.* consumer confidence deteriorated sharply in december, as the resurgence of covid-19 ""remains a drag on confidence.”* ceo confidence, as tracked by the bloomberg consumer comfort index hit a two week low at 47. this is the sharpest drop in economic outlook since april.**market health:*** nyse cumulative adv/dec:     * actually pretty healthy right now. this is still well above all of its important moving averages and remains in an uptrend.* nyse mcclellan oscillator:     * neutral currently.* nyse summation index (nysi):     * most commonly used by fund managers to find divergences. above a short term 5/8 day exponential moving average is a buy signal. below flashes a short term sell signal. this is *currently showing a sell signal.* however, sell signals in rallies tend to be early signals...* moving averages:     * the 8/21-week ema crossover has long been a favorite signal for momentum in individual names and also works with indices. the 21-week ema is important support for growth/momentum stocks. in general, you want to be long when the 8 week is above the 21 week and short when it is below with crossovers being key trend inflection signals. the 12-month moving average (ma) and monthly macd are good longer-term risk management tools. the price action relative to the 200-week ma provides a good gauge for the health of the s&amp;p 500’s secular trend. pullbacks or corrections (aka cyclical bear markets) for the s&amp;p 500 that hold above or near the rising 200-week ma are a secular bull market pattern. pullbacks that decisively break the 200-week ma are a sign of a secular bear market. most corrections on the s&amp;p 500 during the 1950-1966 and 1980-2000 secular bull market held between the 100-week ma and the 200-week ma. the 2015-2016 s&amp;p 500 pullback fit this secular bull market correction pattern. the secular bear market periods from 1929-1950, 1966-1980, and 2000-2013 saw sustained periods below these long-term moving averages. this means that the 200-week ma provides a good secular bull market risk management tool or stop loss. using this history as a guide suggests that the ichimoku monthly cloud is a good trailing secular bull market stop loss. history also suggests that a decisive move below the monthly cloud confirms a secular bear market for us equities. *currently we are above all moving averages and this is a bullish signal.***economics:*** the common theme appears to be an expectation of a synchronized global growth in 2021.* the optimism on 2021 delivering a record year for corporate profit growth and strong gdp growth around the globe is very contingent on a successful vaccine rollout. the current surge of cases and hospitalizations in the us and europe is resulting in further restrictions and lockdowns that will weigh on growth expectations, or at least push out pent-up demand. consumers have led the recovery so far with a boost from fiscal stimulus but the key to a self-sustained recovery is a strong capex cycle which is seen kicking off in q2 2021. the labor market will also be in focus after record low unemployment the pandemic saw the number jump to 14.7% in april, the highest since the great depression, but has recovered rapidly though losing some momentum as it finished the year near 6.5% unemployment and consensus expectations to reach 5% by the end of 2021, still far-off from the 3.5% pre-crisis rate.* the recovery has already started in 2h20 in the us &amp; china while the european recovery has been more subdued. the driver of the strong 2021 recovery will be the full reopening of economies worldwide which makes a successful vaccine distribution critical. the us dollar is closing 2020 weak and looks to have some structural issues with surging deficits, fed’s intention to boost inflation, easy financial conditions, and expected economic and political improvements. the combination of easy monetary policy, a rebound in old economy industries and a global upswing in growth provides a healthy backdrop for 2021. the balance sheets of households, corporate and governments are expanding alongside the aggressive monetary policy and signs of inflation returning causing a rotation back to value and cyclical growth supported by a steepening yield curve.* gdp is seeing rising 6.4% globally in 2021 according to morgan stanley, the consensus is for 5.4% growth. in the us those numbers are 5.9% and 3.8% respectively.* inflation would be the key risk into 2021 with it likely to start showing up in 2h21, and the risk being an overshoot could start a disruptive shift in fed policy. surging debt remains another concern, as a share of u.s. gdp, total debt has spiked near a record high and total nonfinancial debt has surged to new all-time highs. the rapid increase in government deficits is due to the combination of 1) the budget shortfall that already existed and was growing, plus 2) the deficit spending to fund the stimulus programs to date.* the other clear risk in 2021 is china where debt defaults are rising and could spark a move to credit tightening and a recession that would strangle the global recovery. the overall default rate is currently low but the percentage spike in debt/gdp was the highest since 2009 which could lead to policy tightening in 2021.**market valuation and fundamentals:*** the nasdaq continue to outperform in 2020 with a 45%+ ytd return compared to the s&amp;p at +15% as major secular trends in technology continue to play out. the trend of rapid rotational moves also continue with growth often seeing selling pressure for a few days before quickly recovering and resuming the longer-term uptrends. into 2021 earnings growth is expected to be a record though room for multiple expansion is minimal. a combination of improving economic conditions causing greater business and consumer confidence should drive strong earnings growth in 2021. increased fiscal spending and a moderation of tariffs provide additional tailwinds. in 2020 many businesses shedded labor and transformed business models to higher productivity to offset the collapse in demand and low inventories with rebounding production point to margin expansion in 2021. the 2021 environment shapes up to be one of solid earnings growth, a return of buybacks and modest multiple contraction. the growth versus value debate is likely to continue but the low-rate environment continues to favor growth, but even more-so a greater preference for quality, companies with strong balance sheets, cash flow generation, and returns on capital should continue to outperform. we are seeing historically strong earnings revision ratios and a record percentage of stocks with dividend yields above the rate of the ten-year treasury, both conducive to allocations to equities. compared to bonds, equities can act as a hedge in case of inflation and, with a thorough selection process, can still offer returns closer to historical returns.* my forecasts for 2021 take into account consensus expectations, a bull case for a strong vaccine rollout, and a bear case for disruptions to the vaccine rollout and geopolicatical potential issues. i am assigning a 40% probability for the bull case, 40% for the base case, and 20% for the bear case to arrive at a s&amp;p fair value of 3600 though 1h21. in 2h21 we start to look to 2022 estimates and feel we can approach $200 eps with slight multiple contraction to 22x leaving upside potential to 4400 for year-end 2021.[https://imgur.com/a/qqpjfbu](https://imgur.com/a/qqpjfbu)* for 2021, the bottom-up eps estimate (which reflects an aggregation of the median eps estimates for cy 2021 for all of the companies in the index) is $169.20. for cy 2021, analysts are projecting earnings growth of 21.7% and revenue growth of 7.7%. the 6% trend growth rate since the 1930s would point to s&amp;p 500 eps getting back to trend levels of $187 in 2022. an optimistic vaccine scenario would see s&amp;p 2022 eps well above $200.[https://imgur.com/a/llhmsb3](https://imgur.com/a/llhmsb3)* the low rate environment impacts the multiple, and assuming the 10-year stays low, the fed keeps rates at zero, and credit spreads stay firm, a valuation framework would put a trailing pe at 24x and forward at 21.5x for the current environment. the spread between the s&amp;p dividend yield versus the corporate baa bond yield is near historical highs and the erp (equity risk premium) is very high by many measures. assuming the spread between the dividend yield and ig corporate yield goes back to 2012-19 levels, it would point to 30%- plus upside for s&amp;p 500 valuations. assuming some rise in rates as the spread narrows more from falling equity yields would point to 20%-plus upside. in 2021, policy support should remain in place to curtail risk aversion. besides the risk of a credit crisis, concerns over a late-cycle overheating have been pushed further out due to the pandemic-induced recession and policy makers’ increased inflation tolerance. when comparing relative attractiveness across asset classes, which ultimately steers a substantial part of investment flows, equity markets continue to look quite attractive. since the beginning of 2020, real bond yields in the usa have declined by over 100 basis points, outpacing the decline in earnings yields (inverse of the price-earnings ratio), thus supporting higher valuation multiples. currently the difference between the earnings yield and the real bond yield as a measure for the equity risk premium (erp) is higher than the long-term average, suggesting that equities offer an attractive excess return over bonds. although lower interest rates support higher multiples due to the increase value of future earnings, a return to normal could push long-term interest rates higher and exert downward pressure on equity valuation multiples.[sector growth rates](https://imgur.com/a/ijpipww)**analyst 2021 predictions:*** morgan stanley: $3900 - after a year of big swings in valuations, 2021 will be about who can deliver on earnings. 2020 was all about beta and understanding how equity markets trade in and around a recession that handed us the fattest pitch we’ve seen in a decade. 2021 will be much more about stock picking (alpha) and should favor those companies that can deliver earnings growth that isn’t already expected or priced. msco prefers companies with earnings growth most tied to re-openings and an economic recovery and also favors small caps. financials are also preferred due to positive upside skew on rising rates and better credit; materials and industrials on demand rebound, earnings leverage and inflation protection; and health care given its garp characteristics and re-rating potential with fading political overhangs.* bank of america: $3800 - stocks have already priced in much of the expected recovery in the economy and corporate profitability, leaving just slightly more upside heading into next year. even as investors ride a wave of vaccine-related optimism, potential negative catalysts abound. the recovery is intact and the world likely reopens in the 2h, but a lot of optimism is priced in already on vaccine/recovery. vaccine execution risk, delayed fiscal stimulus and longer lockdowns are risks. but a few themes support stocks: the s&amp;p 500 dividend yield is 3x the 10-year yield, and s&amp;p 500 dividends are set to increase in 2021. and unlike bond yields, earnings are nominal and participate in inflationary upside – where inflation risks may be running higher, given rampant money-printing and a potential post-vaccine spike in demand. baml picks value stocks over growth, cyclicals over defensives and small caps over large caps, given each of these groups’ likelihoods to be disproportionately boosted by a post-virus economic recovery.* goldman sachs: $4300 - a vaccine is a more important development for the economy and markets than the prospective policies of a biden presidency. the economic reopening coming alongside a vaccine, in tandem with a status quo policy environment cemented with a divided government, will help push the s&amp;p 500 to 4,300 by year-end 2021 and then to 4,600 by the end of 2022. the forecast assumes that the senate will remain under republican control following the georgia run-off elections in january, the economy will continue on a path toward a “v-shaped” recovery, corporate profits will rebound, fed funds rate will hold near-zero and the yield curve will steepen while the 10-year treasury yield climbs only modestly.* deutsche bank: $3950 - much of 2020’s run-up in the stock market came with multiples expansion, as prices escalated despite a drop in earnings, as companies dealt with fallout due to the coronavirus pandemic. next year, as the economy recovers and a vaccine allows for long-lasting re-openings, earnings growth will rebound and multiples will de-rate. the pattern of the equity market recovery, bottoming halfway through recession and recouping most of its losses before it’s over, has been typical but the continued run-up means valuations are high. in our reading, elevated multiples reflect increased participation of retail investors which we see as sustaining, but we expect the multiple to begin to de-rate. for 2021, a recovery in earnings — which essentially increases the denominator of the price-earnings ratio — should lower multiples. that said, an increase in companies’ payout ratios as dividends and buybacks return could at least partially offset this. a gradual correction of overvaluation argues for the current overvaluation of 5 multiple points to diminish but remain significant at 3.6 points, putting the end-2021 multiple at 20.5x.* jefferies: $4200 - improving prospects for a vaccine, easy lending conditions and broader participation among cyclical and value stocks will help propel the stock market higher in 2021. november’s historic stock market rally, led by cyclical and value stocks in the energy, financials and industrials sectors, reflected broadening equity strength beyond just big tech and software shares. that rotation is anticipated to continue into next year, helping push the broader market higher. notwithstanding the second and third covid-19 waves permeating the world, there is a palpable feeling that the global economy is resynchronizing with the household, corporate and government balance sheets expanding simultaneously alongside aggressive monetary policy. the much-maligned value and cyclical growth sectors are slowly making a comeback as inflation pressures begin to return. this rotation has been supported by a steepening in the yield curve and with growthier stocks trading sideways. improved visibility towards a successful coronavirus vaccine, easier lending conditions, little evidence of deflation and a sentiment switch from growth to value will lift us bank shares through 2021. rising global capacity utilization rates, firmer producer prices, improving world trade volume, booming housing/autos and a weak dollar are the perfect environment for the s&amp;p 500 industrials. the s&amp;p 500 materials sector is blowing off in response to a weak dollar, higher commodity prices, an upswing in global manufacturing and a restocking cycle.* csfb: $4050 - our 2021 forecasts are designed to answer a simple question: what the future will (2022) look like in the future (end of 2021). from this perspective, we are forced to de-emphasize the near-term, focusing instead on the return to a more normal world. as we look toward 2022, the virus will be a fading memory, the economy robust, but decelerating, the yield curve steeper and volatility lower, and the rotation into cyclicals largely behind us. since the stock market discounts future events, each of these prospects for further improvement down the line should translate into a higher s&amp;p 500 as investors price in these events.* ubs: $4100 - the vaccine-related developments that drove stocks’ gains in november and early december have now been baked into market expectations, leaving vaccine distribution the next milestone for equity investors to consider in 2021. the key driver of u.s. equities will be the pace of vaccinations, similar to how shifts in mobility drove equities through the spring and summer. as people get vaccinated, they are likely to ‘normalize’ spending on areas impacted by covid shortly thereafter. we see the rotation toward cyclical services spending and other covid-hit areas as a key investment theme for 2021. ubs is overweight the consumer discretionary, industrials and energy sectors given that consumption and production will likely rebound next year. it downgraded materials and financials to neutral. it is also underweight consumer staples, utilities and reits and neutral on information technology, but overweight communication services and health care on still attractive growth relative to valuations. ubs maintained an upside case for the s&amp;p 500 of 4,400, which would emerge in the case of higher-than-baseline growth against a backdrop of still-low interest rates. however, in a downside case, the s&amp;p 500 could fall to 3,300, which would entail a weaker recovery and/or tighter financial conditions.* bmo capital: $4200 - heading into 2021, stocks are poised to keep reaping the benefits of the massive infusion of monetary support from the federal reserve, along with an anticipated additional round of fiscal stimulus. this constructive policy environment is likely to help push equities higher even as virus concerns linger for at least the first several months of the new year. even with recent positive vaccine and treatment developments, the global pandemic and its unprecedented impact is unlikely to fade in coming months. as such, the massive fiscal and monetary response in the u.s. and around the world (also unprecedented) will likely remain in place to combat its negative economic impact for the foreseeable future. such environments have historically supported continued stock market gains and we see no reason why 2021 will be any different. aside from the global financial crisis, 2020 represented the swiftest quarter-over-quarter earnings collapse for the s&amp;p 500 where index eps plummeted nearly 50% during 1q, thus, we anticipate that 2021 has the potential to be one of the best years ever in terms of earnings growth, something we believe will also help to push stock prices higher. we remain optimistic and expect another year of double-digit gains as the economy and society slowly transition back to normal.* barclays: $4000 - markets are right to be optimistic about the global economic outlook in 2021, with growth returning and inflation rising but staying below central bank targets. projected global gross domestic product growth of 5.6% in 2021, rebounding from a 3.6% contraction this year, with most western economies reaching so-called herd immunity from covid-19 in the second and third quarters of the year. forecasts reflected the recent slew of positive vaccine results with efficacy rates exceeding expectations, which point to a significant boost for growth in the second quarter of 2021. barclays also suggested the inflation outlook would not indicate any unwinding of current unprecedented levels of central bank support. labor markets are recovering, but we are still at very high unemployment, so there is undeniably a lot of slack in the system. that means that when it comes to core inflation and the underlying drivers, to wage costs etc., that was unlikely to happen in the short run, meaning even next year. it would take several years really to come back. while barclays anticipates a gradual improvement in inflation, it will not be significant enough to cause central banks to consider tightening their accommodative monetary policy stances. we have an environment whereby growth comes back, inflation stays relatively muted, and you have central banks continuing to support the recovery, and tightening is still far out.* oppenheimer: $4300 - the s&amp;p 500 is likely to post another double-digit percentage gain in 2021 as the distribution of covid-19 vaccines underpins a lasting economic recovery. this outcome is based on six key assumptions: first, that the public will expediently accept and receive covid-19 vaccines and second, that equity investors will discount the success of the vaccines in reversing the disruptions brought on by the pandemic. thirdly assumes that at least one of the two senate seats in the georgia runoff election will go to a republican lawmaker, thereby retaining their control of the senate and reducing (if not necessarily eliminating) the risk that the biden administration will eradicate the corporate tax reform act of 2017. fourth, the federal reserve will continue its low interest rate regime in tandem with accommodative monetary policy, and fifthly, that congressional lawmakers will step in with another round of fiscal stimulus by the first quarter of 2021 at the latest. lastly, that investor appetite will continue to tilt toward “stocks that favor diversification and both growth and value segments of the market in a relatively low interest rate environment that favors equities, real assets and other asset classes over fixed income for intermediate and longer-term objectives. the vaccine rollout is arguably the most important in determining the trajectory of the s&amp;p 500 next year. ultimately the stock market is broadly dependent on economic growth to drive revenues and earnings across the sectors.* jp morgan: $4400 - investors are entering 2021 against a confluence of market-positive events, including improving prospects for widespread vaccinations and sustained economic reopening, gridlock in washington and accommodative central bank policy. given the covid-19 crisis, vaccine distribution is likely the linchpin event. but even with widespread vaccine availability still months away, optimism over early vaccine efficacy data has already sparked a rally among stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic. the equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years. after a prolonged period of elevated risks (global trade war, covid-19 pandemic, u.s. election uncertainty, etc.), the outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing. we expect a ‘market nirvana’ scenario for equities with the melt-up continuing into 1h21, driven by earnings recovery and multiple expansion. much of next year’s stock market rise is likely to come at the beginning of the year, as lingering uncertainties over vaccine distribution, the results of the georgia senate race and

8097,"happy new year, folks! it's certainly been an interesting one.i thought it could be interesting to look back on our cagr for the year and reflect on what went right and what didn't.i'll go first. this year, my cagr ended up around a tidy 30%. i'm quite happy with my performance, given my relative inexperience (i've only been in this game for ~4 years, and this was my first year trading options). we'll see how much of it i'll have to give back in the next correction.**what did i do right?**well, my core positions have been pretty consistent. ~15% of my portfolio is in semiconductors, mainly tsm, and the structural advantages, increasing applications, and large moat that this industry has continues to pay off. my next largest sector is consumer discretional retail (amzn, baba, meli, rth, wmt), which saw a huge boost because of the lockdown. i am worried about seeing some pullback next year and shoppers return to their previous habits, but we'll handle that if/when it occurs.my biggest gains have been from well-timed purchases of smaller cap companies: bjri, blmn, m, jwn, dltr, and aal were all very kind to me.i got into spacs the last few months of the year. it's a relatively low-information market, and seems somewhat luck-based, but i have made some successful plays there as well.my decision in august to keep any funds not allocated to an active strategy or thesis in vti and vtwo instead of in bnd or as cash has paid off, due to low interest rates and asset inflation.**what was just ok?**my third largest sector is healthcare, which underperformed this year due to eyepopping gains in tech and retail. i'm alright with the opportunity cost there.i made a small investment into bitcoin, which i sold at $19k after a 16% gain. i should have held (hedled?) - but i have trouble remaining confident in investments without a strong underlying value investing thesis.my luck with short-selling has been poor this year. my short positions in gsx and nkla were pretty successful, but i lost a lot of money shorting fcpt, acc, blmn, and bjri earlier in the year. on the other hand, the excellent performance of bjri and blmn meant i later turned them into (ultimately very profitable) long positions, which i likely wouldn't have discovered without the initial short thesis.there are so many astounding run-ups i knew about rather early on and missed out on: tsla, nio, pltr, qs. the hype around these tickers and the sky-high pe ratios scared me off, which might not be a good response in the current market regime. that said, my investing style has to fit my philosophy and psychology to work, so i'll remain disciplined in trying to find opportunities that match my approach.**what choices were mistakes?**i tried options this year. i began by paper trading options and lost a lot of (fake money). i then moved on the real-life option plays, and bsically broke even. even so, the stress is *unreal*. i understand how the option greeks and black-scholes works, but it still catches me by surprise when the price moves in my favor and my spreads lose money anyway. the wide spreads and crazy volatility is really hard to deal with, and a single options play starts to take up more headspace than the rest of my portfolio. as a result, i often end up selling too soon. i don't think directional options plays are for me. i may try selling covered calls in the future.about 60% of the time i've tried to catch a falling knife this year, i've failed. otgly and swi are two good examples. i'm still not sure how to deal with this.i suck at scalping - my attempts at playing spxl and spxs during march and april's high-volatility periods destroyed the subsequent 3 months of returns.**what did i learn?**value investing is still alive and well in 2020 - you just need to understand how to look for opportunities and value growing companies.i need to respect the tax man: i didn't max out my 401k contribution this year because i wanted to amass some cash in order to eventually put a down payment on a property - i'm going to pay for that in april.i still don't know where the sweet spot is for leverage. i know options aren't it for me, but i can't help but feel that i could improve my returns by levering up on my high-conviction, low-voatility plays. i'll continue to explore this in 2021.excited to see how you all did this year!",4,1,Let's reflect on our performance in 2020,Finance

**$psth – activist investor bill ackman’s gigantic spac – updated dd** 🚀i last wrote on psth roughly 30 days ago and at the time the spac was getting very little press attention. ackman announced the spac in the spring of 2020 and it started trading in july at an nav of $20. ackman has steadily collected an impressive investor list, filled with long term and reputable names.since then and since my last post, a lot has happened. this dd serves to provide an update and recap for those new to the stock and considering a play here.**tldr;**psth is a gigantic spac with a reputable ceo and the most impressive investor list ever created. for context, chamath's largest spac (ipof) is worth $1.6b. psth is worth $5b with the option to increase to $7b. it is enormous. the company is on record for a q1 announcement and is targeting a “mature unicorn”. at an nav of $20, the downside risk is capped significantly while the upside potential is very high depending on target.**two key points in addition to the tldr:**two aspects of this stock that most people miss to begin with (i've engaged with enough of them online to know):**1)** tontine: detailed below but in essence, for every common share you buy now and hold through the merger and ticker change, you get 2/9 a warrant exercisable at $23. that means for every 9 commons you own, you will receive another 2 commons later at a price of $23 (the stock trades at $26 today)**aka if you own 99 commons through the merger, you get 22 more shares at $23 cost each simply for holding through the merger.****this is what 2/9 tontine means. it can grow to 3/9 or 4/9 if people choose not to hold through the merger, because the number of warrants is constant and will all be given out to someone.****\*\*\*another note here: beware the manager's right to redeem warrants. this is in the s-1 but the manager's have the right to redeem warrants if the share price meets or exceeds $36 on 20/30 trading days. they have to give you 30 days notice, so just keep that in mind. the warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) 1 year post listing which was in july 2020. so as long as you are keeping an eye on events, you will be okay. don't fall asleep on the stipulation though.****for example, if the stock price was to jump to $50 on loi and then the merger happens 2 months later, 30 days post that merger you warrants go live but so does the manager's right to issue a redemption notice. at that point you would likely consider redeeming the warrants since at the end of that window they could be taken by manager for pennies each. no upside cap based on my reading of the s1, but just be vigilant once the merger is announced.****2)** the bank set up. typically the big banks gouge the eyes out of ipos and traditional spacs with fees, etc. we have seen big big misses on the order of $3-4b for both snowflake and abnb. with psth, ackman has went a different route abandoning the large cap banks and instead giving underwriting privileges to a ton of small and minority owned banks and credit lenders. this is a legacy move. he's more interested in changing the landscape because he believes (and has explained) that quality public entry structures are the best improvements we can make for the economy, society, and the common retail investor. the structure also incentivizes him to make an exceptional deal, that's the only way he makes money through the warrant system, if the deal goes well. this is why huge names are on board, but only one big bank is. this spac is opposing the conventional bank-led ipo process. that in itself, is a game changer and once this pops and gets press you can bet your boots that future spac leaders (chamath, etc.) will transition to this method.**background information and recent events**· in july 2020, bill ackman went live with spac $psth – the spac raised $5b in proceeds with the option to take it to $7b (leveraging funds from pscm, ackman’s hedge fund) making it the biggest spac ever created.· in multiple interviews following the spacs debut, ackman has been clear about several things:o he is hunting for a “mature unicorn” - unicorn is defined as $1b or more but ""mature"" here is the key, he's looking for a company worth tens of billions.o he has stipulated a predictable business is most ideal with steady cash flow or guarantees along the lines of predictable growtho this means a large cap, well run, asset light, family owned, high moat, company according to ackman. he has explicitly said he's also friendly to a fintecho he has a buying power of approximately $7b dollars at present and is hoping to capture a minority stake of between 15-20% of a large enterprise. this means a valuation in the ballpark of $30-40b.**o ackman has recruit an incredible board of directors at psth, leveraging raw talent from both media and fintech sectors:**lisa gersh - former management executive at nbc newsmichael ovitz - former president at the walt disney companyjackie reses - former executive at square, mobile payment companyjoseph steinberg - current chairman of jefferies financial group inc.**\*\*we don't want to jump to conclusions, but on review of the board, this is certainly a media and fintech heavy group of executives\*\***o he has delivered on developing an incredibly impressive list of investors thus faro **investors in the spac so far include:**§ baupost group (headed by seth klarman, $30b hedge fund manager, “the next buffet” and noted value investor) = $450m position§ guggenheim capital = $560m position§ ontario teachers pension plan = $290m position§ soroban capital = $290m position§ wells fargo = $290m position§ kevin “sharktank” o’leary = undisclosed position to be reported in q1§ **warren buffet’s** position remains speculative. he recently left his jpm position and is secretly adding to a big position (pushing the filing deadline requirements as he does whenever he builds a big position as to not cause an overprice of the stock before he finishes buying). there is also a large undisclosed position in psth held by someone from q3. this remains completely speculative and it may not be buffet but another large stakeholder or pension fund.**§ key point: \*\*no other big banks have secured big positions in psth\*\***o the investor list above is just a sample of the top holders. each of these positions were made at the end of q3 of this year. the stock has risen $2 or 10% of nav since this time (not much considering the size and runway ahead).**psth spac design**· psth is called a spac, but as others have pointed out, it does not resemble any other spac, in size or design. some details:· psth incentivizes long-term holding and only dramatic upward shifts in the stock price through its unique “tontine” structure. upon purchase of one common share and holding of that share through announcement and merger, owners receive 2/9 of a warrant with a strike of $23. those who buy and sell on announcement bounce therefore give up that 2/9 and it goes back into the pool for those who hold through merger. what a lot of people are missing is what this means. it means that the ceiling for the value of that fractional warrant is unknown but at minimum is 2/9. if there was a minority sell off on announcement that 2/9 could increase to 3/9 or 4/9 warrant for those who stay in. this creates a wild incentive for long-term holding of the company and is referenced in the ""tontine"" name - look it up, pretty cool.**targets**much speculation exists online as to what companies ackman is targeting. here are some key points:· earlier in the year he commented publicly on air b&amp;b, stripe and bloomberg. he praised all three companies publicly.· since that interview, air b&amp;b has gone public via ipo and notably lost out on $3.8b during the valuation process and ipo**· stripe has generated intense interest online.** despite the hype, the collison brothers (head of stripe) have publicly commented via tweet that “no such deal” had been struck after a wsb twitter account congratulated the brother’s in a silly way. despite this, many (including me) believe that stripe is still very much in play and that some of this is a negotiation tactic. when questioned on stripe, ackman was gracious but said that the company was not ready to go public, citing managerial and personnel deficits only. in the immediate aftermath of that comment (literally the next week), stripe went on an insane hiring spree specific to public managerial positions. this has been documented extensively by [u/yolocapitalmgmt](https://www.reddit.com/u/yolocapitalmgmt/) on twitter. ackman is on record saying his biggest regret in investing was not getting in on mastercard due to regulation uncertainty. he said the best investment you could ever make, assuming valuation made sense, was in a company that made royalties on others spending money. he has since commented that psth would very much be in favor of merging with a fintech. big name fintech exec jackie reeses (former head of square) has been added to the board of psth, creating even more speculation around stripe as a target).**· bloomberg remains in play.** there has been no definitive declination by bloomberg and rumors in the past exist in both directions. michael bloomberg has both commented that he would not take the company public and that there could be interest in a minority stake being sold.· other potential targets that have been floated with little in the way of momentum include spacex, fidelity, inspire brands and subway.**target summary based on my view**targets in order of likelihood of q1 merger announcement1. bloomberg2. stripe3. fidelity**bill ackman**a few notes on the ceo of the spac, william a. ackman:· a billionaire activist hedge fund manager with a highly interesting track record if you’re interested in looking into it.· he has had some misses in years gone by most notably herbalife short (where he was correct but still lost money) and valeant.· in recent years he has mounted an insane comeback poster annualized return of 50 and 60%.· some of his most iconic recent plays include chipotle (take a look at that story) and canadian pacific· notably he shorted the market prior to covid, correctly predicting a financial collapse. through the use of cds (made popular during the 2008 financial crisis, he turned a $27m insurance policy into a $2.6b trade in march of this year. he subsequently used the funds to advance positions in high quality companies he was a holder of (when these stocks were at their absolute lows in march).**some other notes**this is a highly interesting play and to get in you are betting on ackman and the

9039,"so, you have made it through paragraph after paragraph of me talking about the uranium bull market, reasons why we need nuclear power, what will drive this market and what companies i feel like are best positioned to take advantage of it (if you haven't, i would advice reading them and the comments below each post to get an answer to any question you might have). perhaps you may have decided to invest, so now what? general consensus is that when investing, it is best to invest for the long term. this could mean anywhere from 10, 20, 30 or the rest of your life in years, depending on what your goal is. this is not the case with uranium however. yes i do bet on nuclear power being one of the most important solutions to climate change and yes i believe we will expand on it in a big way in the coming decade with next generation power plants and small modular reactors, but that is not how you want to invest in this market. the uranium market is cyclical and it should be treated as such, so how do we recognize the patterns and know when to get in or out?   see, a cycle seems to be triggered when nuclear power utilities have to come into the market to sign new long term contracts with the suppliers of uranium, which is called a contracting cycle. most contracts run for around 10 years, some longer and some shorter, but all long term. this causes a big increase in demand for uranium, because a lot of utilities are out of contract in 2021 and 2022 after they signed contracts during the last contracting cycle roughly 10 years ago. these utilities also cannot afford to be picky anymore, it has become a sellers’ market. the supply deficit has caused it to become a ‘take what you can get, no matter the price’ situation and with fuel only consisting of around 5% of the total cost to run a nuclear power plant, these utilities will contract at whatever price it takes to secure supply for the long term. the combination of this contracting cycle, a severe impact on production in 2020 and 2021 due to covid-19, the lack of companies currently producing, the great reduction of mobile supply globally, the q1 2021 closing of 2 major uranium mines, no expansion at olympic dam and the increasing demand of new reactors coming online will all come together to make a quite ridiculously convincing bull case in my view. even the most skeptical people in the sector, those that try their hardest to dampen expectations, are astounded at how all these different catalysts have come together within the same time frame to form the case for this uranium bull market. now, when do you actually sell your investments once we are fully into this bull market? it takes months upon months to negotiate and sign new long term contracts and it is not like all utilities will come to the market at the same time. with the biggest amount being out of contract somewhere in the next 2 years, they will start negotiating around that timeframe or a bit earlier than that. this bull market will come back down like the cyclical industry that it is when demand is mostly satisfied with these long term contracts and when new and old mines are brought back and the supply deficit shrinks, at least that is the general consensus of what will happen. knowing this, i would think this bull market lasts somewhere into 2025, but the peak might be a bit earlier when everyone is scrambling for supply and the price per pound rises like it did in the previous bull market. when/if this price reaches roughly triple digits, is when you start selling out of your position. do not do it all at once, as no one can predict the market, but start trimming your positions around that time. selling into strength is your best bet here. between 2004 and 2007, the price of uranium had to go up to around 50 dollars to incentivize new mining. it way overshot into triple digit territory due to a variety of reasons (mine floods, hedge fund buying, etc.) and came back down quickly after that. it could overshoot massively this time as well, but nobody knows if or when that might happen, so selling parts of your position around this time to lock in some gains is advisable. remember, no one ever went broke taking a profit. best of luck to all of you.all statistics on long term contracting, increased demand, price action and more can be found in this presentation by mike alkin and sachem cove. it will visualize everything i have talked about in this and previous posts: https://m.box.com/shared_item/https%3a%2f%2fapp.box.com%2fs%2fogo9v4k2uvi2ko5yi4cdl4wcdwko3ana",136,1,"Uranium, a great investment opportunity (talking exit strategy and catalysts for 2021)",Finance

is set to be the busiest year-end on record for initial public offerings in the u.s., with doordash inc. and airbnb inc. ready to start trading this week in long-awaited listings.the two startups, which are aiming to raise a combined us$6.2 billion at the top-end of their price ranges, will propel the month’s ipo volume to all-time high, surpassing the us$8.3 billion mark set in december of both 2001 and 2003, according to data compiled by bloomberg. ipos on u.s. exchanges have already raised a record us$156 billion this year, the data show.both listings got an additional boost as the companies headed into the final stretch of marketing their shares. doordash upped the price range for its stock in a friday filing, while airbnb is planning to follow suit and increase its price range ahead of its ipo, people familiar with the matter said sunday. the companies are now each expected to raise as much as us$3.1 billion, putting them among the top five biggest u.s. ipos of 2020.private companies that sat out the market chaos in the early days of the covid-19 pandemic -- and were awaiting a final outcome in the u.s. election -- are now rushing to go public. airbnb and doordash will quickly be followed by three other mega-listings that could add billions of dollars to the ipo tally.also on deck to go public this month are affirm holdings inc., which lets online shoppers pay for purchases such as peloton bikes in installments, online video-game company roblox corp. and contextlogic inc., the parent of discount online retailer wish. each is likely to attain a valuation of tens of billions of dollars in its listing.“this group of companies that you have coming out now maybe weren’t thought of initially as benefiting, but they’ve been able to show very strong results despite the coronavirus,” said karen snow, head of east coast listings at nasdaq inc.airbnb is aiming to be valued at as much as us$42 billion in its ipo, while doordash could hit a valuation of about us$35 billion, based on their updated price ranges. for doordash, that’s more than double the private valuation it hit in a june fundraising round, after it seized on the pandemic-fueled boom in demand for meals brought to your door. airbnb had been valued at us$18 billion in april after raising additional debt to shore up its finances. the company, which was initially hit hard by global travel restrictions, has more recently seen a boom in customers seeking longer-term, domestic rentals.airbnb’s ipo will also be a lucrative event for many of its employees. the company has offered billions of dollars worth of stock compensation to staff, similar to uber technologies inc. and other large venture-backed companies that have gone public. the ipo will make some of its longtime employees millionaires on paper.**time and cash**earlier this year, technology ipos were dominated by enterprise software companies such as snowflake inc., which has soared more than 200 per cent since its listing to a us$110 billion public market valuation. this month’s cluster of soon-to-be public entities -- all based in the san francisco bay area -- cater to consumers stuck at home with extra time and cash on their hands.should the listings go well, it could signal investors are optimistic about an economic rebound after the dark days of the pandemic.“there’s a lot of support and interest from institutional investors for companies that are impacted by covid because the feeling is that they will recover,” said neil kell, bank of america corp.’s vice chairman of global equity capital markets.“the mindset is not that we’re in december of 2020,” he said. “the mindset is how is it going to look a year from now.”one enterprise software listing is also planned for this week. c3.ai inc., founded by former oracle corp. executive tom siebel, is expected to raise as much as us$527 million in its ipo.**gauging demand**bankers are using new methods to execute these large share sales, incorporating technology under development for years that was well-timed for use during the pandemic, when potential buyers can’t meet the company executives and advisers in person.airbnb, doordash and roblox have asked prospective ipo investors to fill in their deal orders via an online portal, indicating their level of interest at any desired price, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the details are private.the new process is aimed at helping issuers and their advisers gauge demand, especially for high-growth companies subject to wide differences in valuation among investors, the people said. the final price and share allocation are still determined by the seller.representatives for the companies declined to comment.unity software inc., used the same system in its september ipo. unity sold its shares for $52 each and ended its first day of trading at us$68.35. the shares closed friday at us$150.94 apiece.",62,1,"Airbnb,

9775,"i have to be honest, i didn’t expect to make another post so soon, but i have been flooded with messages and comments in the past few days, so i deemed it necessary (oh and also for the people crowning me things like the ‘uranium messiah’, ‘uranium guru’ and ‘that one uranium guy’, i am flattered, so thank you). since my last post i have gotten a lot of questions regarding investing in uranium, the thesis, nuclear power, geopolitical changes and what the bear case for uranium is. so, i have decided to make a post highlighting the 10 most commonly asked questions so that more people can read my general answers to those and be informed about them. here they are:    q: isn’t nuclear power being phased out around the world?   a: no it isn’t, the us now has bipartisan support for it, canada is looking at smr technology, the uk intends to build small modular reactors, france has pushed back the phasing out of their nuclear power fleet from 2025 to 2035, several eastern european countries are planning new reactors, china and the middle-east are heavily pushing the construction of new power plants and there are many other examples of nuclear power being favored once more.    q: what companies should i invest in within the uranium sector:    a: check my post history and the subsequent comments, especially from my last post, to get an idea of specific stock picks. i don’t want to violate any subreddit guidelines by posting them here. what i can post however, is that everyone should check out the urnm etf and their holdings to get started.    q: uranium has been trending downwards for almost a decade, who should it change now?  a: covid-19 has really blown this market wide open and probably made sure this bull market started earlier by a margin of at least 1 or perhaps even 2 years. this rally was built on historic seasonality, bipartisan support from the us government and their strategic reserve bill, geopolitical backing of nuclear power, the closing of cigar lake (one of the world’s largest uranium mines) and the covering of uranium investing by some of the more mainstream investment outlets.    q: did i miss the run already?    a: no, we are nowhere close to reaching the end of this run and we probably still have years left before we see anything resembling a top. there are 6 phases to this investment and we are only just now barely starting to see the end of phase 1. remember, the spot price of uranium needs to go to approximately $67.10 a pound to incentivize enough new production to have even a shout of fixing the supply deficit, although common consensus within the sector is that we need even more than that and that the spot price can reach inflation adjusted new all-time highs (~170 dollars a pound)    q: won’t solar, wind and hydro remove the need for nuclear power and thus uranium?    a: no it won’t, see the first question, it is the best and safest form of baseload green power generation we have. but for the sake of argument, let’s say we only finish the reactors currently under construction and shut all further planning of new reactors. what will happens? guess what, the supply deficit is still significant and the thesis will still play out. there is roughly a 57 million pound supply deficit and the spot market is getting thin with both cameco and kazatomprom (the world’s 2 largest producers) buying on the spot market. this can’t hold out for much longer, regardless of whether or not nuclear power plants keep being constructed.    q: if the price shoots up, can’t people just find alternatives to uranium?    a: no, for two key reasons. firstly, as discussed above, we need nuclear power and we are starting to favor it more and more, which means we need a lot of uranium to meet demand. it is also impossible to change the fuel source in these nuclear reactors, you can’t just fill a plant up with natural gas or oil and hope it will do something. secondly, unlike gas plants and coal plants, uranium is only a small portion of the total operational cost of these reactors. while with gas and coal it can be up to 80-85% of total costs, with uranium it is closer to 5-10%. this means that price can double and double again from here, without having an enormous impact on the total cost structure. demand is relatively inelastic.    q: when prices go up, can’t kazakhstan or some other state owned entity not just flood the market with uranium and bring the price back down?    a: they can’t and they won’t (kazatomprom has tended to favor quality over quantity since 2017). first of all, it can take up to 2 years for uranium to go from the ground all the way through the enrichment process and be ready to be used as fuel. this means that even if it was possible and these companies start pumping out massive amounts of uranium, it would take up to 2 years for it to even be used as fuel. this is why security of supply needs to be met years in advance, so that a reactor does not sit there without a fuel source. in terms of the fuel cycle, we are already well into 2023. in terms of the development of new uranium sources to reach the market, we might be in 2030 already. a decade is tomorrow in uranium.    q: but isn’t there hundreds of millions of pounds of uranium on earth?    a: yes there is, but no one is going to mine that at these prices. it takes many years to fully permit and construct a uranium mine in most countries. there might be plenty of supply out there, but there certainly isn’t a way to reach it easily without significant price incentive. figures of 130 dollars or more per pound of uranium have been quoted as being needed to get to all these different sources of uranium.    q: what are some catalysts to look out for in 2021?    a: there are several. biden’s implementation of the ‘green new deal’, reactors finishing construction and being activated (needing around 3x as much uranium to start with to build a fuel core), the closure of two uranium mines (ranger and cominak, a combined ~7 million pounds a year, gone), long term contract negotiations, spot price increasing to meet the  increase in enrichment prices of the past few years, institutional money getting into the sector and last but not least more news on the development and possible implementation of small modular reactor technology. all these catalyst make 2021 a year to look forward to for uranium.    q: when should i sell my shares?    a: i can’t tell you that, tops are nearly impossible to call in any sector. however, to get an idea of how a uranium bull market can unfold, here is an article covering the entirety of the previous bull market which ended in 2007. read it, take some notes, read it again and craft an exit strategy for yourself. this is not a lifetime hold, don’t fall in love with these stocks, there will be a time to sell.  https://thetideoffortune.com/would-you-have-made-a-fortune-in-uranium-part-1/  oh and an extra point regarding whether or not you should buy into the sector after the recent price run up:if you have not yet established a position in the market, i would advise to do so and scale in over time and extra on weakness. it is a volatile market and a pullback will come, the question is if that it today or next week after another 20% run up.   so there we have it, 10 questions about the sector and the thesis. i have tried my best to provide short and easy to understand answers and i hope it helps all of you. make sure to always do your own due diligence and asses your own risk tolerances, so that you are not shaken out by the volatility of this sector. best of luck with your investments. ",330,1,Answers to the 10 most asked questions regarding the uranium bull market,Finance

10607,"$levi: the biggest position here, bought at $15.45. the reason behind this, as in all the others, is pretty simple, levi’s is the biggest jeans company, they fabricate and sell jeans (also other things but their specialty are jeans), their p/e ratio was around 15x 2019 earnings, and they’re smaller than i thought, they are just entering china (with good reviews for what i’ve read), not that big in japan and they poses what i believe to be an important trademark, everyone knows them, a hundred years could pass and they would still be there, also they were trading for less than their ipo and i don’t believe them to be worth less than that. they’re what they are, just an ol' good pair of jeans.$fcau: bought at $13.19. they sell cars, i like their cars and their balance sheet (better than ford and gm, maybe because it’s simpler to undestand for me), not too much bank debt and what i think to be a good quantity of cash at hand, their psr was around 0.2, seemed pretty good to me, as good as their p/e, also their price to research was around 6 and every year they’re destining more money to automated and sustainable driving research. lastly but not less important, i really believe that the car industry will do better in the next couple of years, like who’s even buying cars right now? so, i expect them to grow quite something still.$et: bought at $8.34. yeah this is a loosing one for the moment. this one was my first stock ever bought and my reasoning with this one was extremely simple, they are the biggest gas transporter in texas, and they charge for volume moved not based on the price of what they move, their p/e was low but like super low, i’m 86% sure that if something happened to them, government would just bail them out, they are far too important, and here’s the deal, gas is the cleanest energy based on ch at the moment, one day we will stop using hydrocarbons and all but gas will be the last one and there’s still a long way to go for that to happen, btw they’re building the biggest exporter and storage facility in the us (they were supposed to open it in 2021 but you know, the pandemic and all).$gapb.mx: bought at $199.07 mxn. so here we have a mexican company (just as myself), they’re an airport controller company, and have the license to i believe 11 airports in mexico and 2 in jamaica (pardon me if i made a mistake in the exact numbers, i left my notes at my place), also 5 of the mexican airports are in the list of the 10 most transited airports in the country, they seem a little expensive at first sight but i liked their fcf and unless we discover teletransportation or a more effective way of transporting, i guess we will use them more every year, thus, they will earn more money and we will be richer (at least that’s what i hope) oh and airports have a moat bc you don’t just go and open one just because, it’s expensive af and they’re regulated.$danhos13.mx: bought at $22.2 mxn. well you know get rich or die trying and also they own the biggest commercial centers in mexico city and puebla, i love them, my gf loves them and her mother loves them too, they’re always full and they’re beautiful, the best stores are there and actually the only reason for them to be down is bc of the pandemic but seriously this is not just another reit, this is the mexican reit.

(the higher the asset is valued, the less future return you can expect from it)- in recent interview **charlie munger** says next decade we will be getting **lower returns**. **ray dalio** shared similar view.- if **hyperinflation** happens (unlikely, but some conspiracy theorists do claim it can be the case) stocks might rise against usd, but purchasing power will fall, so stock investors will still be left behind.- investing in speculative spacs, tsla valuations, tiktok/youtube investing channels, robbinghood wsb gamblers, margin traders: all symptoms of an ecstatic market. could go on for a few years still, but overall these are signs or overheated market.lost decades have happened before and surely will happen again and time is about right. (what would magically make this time different?) but how do we **protect** ourselves against this and even **thrive** during a lost decade?i assume we have no ability to time the market (good for you if you have).one conclusion is **diversification**.but apart from a **diversified total world stock index**, where can we put our money?- **bonds?** the yields are low and if yields are increased bond indices will fall.- **real estate?** yes, real estate will indeed keep up with inflation, but it is not that easy to purchase for average investor, not liquid and also has risks like increased taxes, amortisation, upkeep, geopolitical risk for people living in potential warzones, etc...- **gold?** not an income producing asset. maybe 5% of portfolio?- **bitcoin.** also not an income producing asset, but makes more sense than gold. but again, normally you would invest 5% max in something so speculative.- **cash?** will be eaten up by inflation. pretty much losing money by doing nothing.- **value stocks?** probably the answer, since historically statistically value stocks have returned more than growth stocks (yes it sounds like a paradox, but statistics prove it). relevant video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uznvt_cvl3k- here is **the problem** if you want to invest in value stocks. you have to have ability to pick them. but why go through all the learning if you can just outsource it to warren buffett and buy berkshire hathaway?one reason might be that you have **advantage** over berkshire hathaway by being able to pick value stocks in **smaller market cap markets** which are inaccessible to brk due to their size.problem is  - due to **information abundance** value investing strategies are **public information** and therefore already **priced in** at least partially. as a value investor in 2020 you have less chances of outperforming the market compared to value investor in 1950s. any dude in slums of india can watch sven carlin, read intelligent investor and decide to become a value investor, so there are serious doubts that average, common investor from reddit will be able to outperform.there are a few more reasons to consider berkshire: by warren buffett and charlie munger passing away in next decade most people assume berkshire will suffer, but in fact, i think the **opposite** will happen: **berkshire will pump**.because markets do **the opposite** of what normies think will happen.warren buffett dies -&gt; berkshire repurchase their stock -&gt; normies realise that the berkshire can function very well without wb and that his knowledge has been fully passed on to those in charge -&gt; normies rush into berkshire. berkshire outperforms s&amp;p during next decade.realistic or stupid?**tl:dr version:** value stocks historically return more than growth stocks and since lately value has been lagging behind and since we are bad stock pickers, shouldn't we just buy berkshire hathaway?what am i missing? what other options do normal investors have? i'm not talking about billionaires who can buy sports teams and so on, but normal people on reddit.",31,1,😱 In preparation of LOST DECADE or few... how do we NOT LOSE everything?,Finance

good investments that can be held for a year  or longer. i'm not posting a full dd for each company, just some points  i find interesting, mostly the values and projections for each. for  disclosure's sake, i am not currently invested in any of these companies  except for mrna and rvp.flgt:if  hearing ""sales growth of 880%"" doesn't perk up your ears i don't know  what will, the last 12 months have been booming for fulgent genetics.  they have exceeded analysts projected earnings estimates by 501% and  277% the last two quarters. this fella is undervalued with those  numbers, even with the stock price up 60% in january alone. currently  going for about $83 but valued around $140. if you buy now you would be  buying at the top, but it's still projected to go higher.mrna:this  is one of the two stocks on this list that i am currently invested in  (approx 9% of my portfolio). while not \*quite\* as impressive as flgt's  880% sales growth, moderna's 826% sales growth over the last year is  still fantastic. one of the most undervalued stocks on this list with  the current price only about 53% of it's current value, moderna has a  lot of potential. mrna is up 55% already in 2021. moderna reported only  $60 million in sales in 2019, but are projected to have between 1.5 to  15 billion in 2021. that's a huge window, but even if they hit the  lowest projection it will be fantastic for the company. again, you would  be buying high if you went in now, but it looks like right now is the  lowest it will be for the foreseeable future.nvax:this  company fascinates me the most on this list. the current price is less  than half of the current value. phenomenal upside potential, with unreal  sales growth in the last 12 months at 999%. novavax stock has rocketed  1302% in the last year. reported 2019 sales of 18.7 million with 2021  sales projections ranging from 1.2 to 4.7 billion. while 999% sales  growth was impressive, the projected annual sales growth is an  astounding 2,815%. i almost wonder if this one is too good to be true,  which is why i haven't invested yet, but i am beyond tempted.hzo:up  34% this month. reported earnings the last two quarters exceeded  analyst projections by 120% and 177%. undervalued with excellent sales  growth. the current quarter looks like it might be mediocre for  marinemax, but the year-long forecasts look great. undervalued by about  33%, the potential upside for marinemax is solid.dq:daqo  new energy's stock has been exploding, up 910% in the past year. it's  slightly undervalued, currently selling for around $100 but valued  closer to $118. they have had sales growth of 51% over the last year  with projected rates going much, much higher. one to keep an eye on.mksi:mks  instruments is the first

you're  thinking about buying, now would be a good time.rvp:the  second stock i am invested in on this list (approx 16% of my  portfolio), retractable technologies stock is up 50% in january. i see  an earnings growth rate around 40% after they had 133% sales growth over  the last 12 months. like all these other picks, rvp is undervalued,  presently going for $16 with a current value closer to $26.lrcx:up  12% this month, lam research doesn't have numbers quite as sexy as the  others on this list but it's worth looking at. earnings exceeded  forecasts by 9% and 17% the last two quarters. undervalued by about  $170, i see lrcx having plenty of room to grow, especially with their  earnings projected to grow by 45%.wild card: pltrpalantir  tech isn't really a wild card, but it breaks from the rest of the list  by being massively overvalued at $38, when the current value is much  closer to $3. it's up 61% in january, but 12 months projections look  grim, with even the best outlooks predicting a 20% decrease in stock  price. the reason i put it on this list is because i do think it will  grow years from now, mostly from what happened earlier this week. lots  of people, especially software developers, were amazed with palantir's  gotham presentation, many of them saying it could be a major player in  the future. i think the stock price will definitely decline, which is  why i'm not buying in now, but it will be worth revisiting when it  drops.like i said, very amateur  dd done for these guys, primarily looking at past and projected sales  and stock price vs value, with some consideration given to price  volatility, price decline resistance, dividends, and timing price  trends. let me know what you think.",42,1,My thoughts on some good future stocks - give me your

11625,"hey there, i'm rocco. i'm planning on growing my portfolio at least 50% per year over the next 10 years and becoming a multimillionaire. aren't we all?the second electric revolution is underway… and it is creating some of the best investment opportunities of this decade.finding the best ways to invest in this revolution is no easy task. for example, many leading companies in the electric vehicle and energy storage sector are losing money. the chinese ev company **nio inc. (nio)** is one high-profile example, but it’s hardly alone. innovation is both expensive and risky.that’s why i have investing in companies that provide essential ingredients to the ev and energy storage industries.i’m talking about “battery metals.”ev and energy storage technologies require vast amounts of metals like lithium, copper, nickel, and manganese. the average battery-electric vehicle, for example, contains about 180 pounds of copper – that’s about half as much as the average american home.so it’s likely that the boom in evs and energy storage will create major “echo booms” in several metal markets.to capitalize on these prospective booms, i’ve purchased several battery metals plays, like **ivanhoe mines ltd. (ivpaf)**, **galaxy resources ltd. (galxf)**, **western areas ltd. (wnarf)**, **eramet (ermay)**, **conic metals capital corp. (conxf)**, **lynas rare earths ltd. (lyscf)**, and **glencore plc (glcnf)**… as well as call options on **freeport mcmoran inc. (fcx)**.earlier this week, i purchased a new battery metal play: **largo resources ltd. (otc: lgorf)**, the largest vanadium miner in the americas.vanadium is key to an innovative energy storage technology – called the vanadium-redox flow battery (vfrb) – that is quickly becoming a desired solution for stationary energy storage applications.energy storage is just another way of saying “batteries.” increasingly, renewable energy installations like wind and solar include a meaningful energy storage capacity.currently, the dominant form of stationary energy storage is lithium-ion technology, but vfrbs possess some major advantages. **they last longer and can be charged and discharged repeatedly, without any significant drop in performance. vanadium-flow batteries also utilize nonflammable material, making them safer and more reliable for large-scale stationary applications than combustion-prone lithium batteries.**for all of you chemistry fans out there, chemical engineer robert rapier provides a helpful analysis of vfrbs in a recent issue of *forbes*. (he calls them vfbs). here are a few excerpts from that analysis:&amp;#x200b;&gt;*vanadium is an element that can commonly exist in four different oxidation states. that just means that it can exist as an ion with different charges. for example, a vanadium ion that is missing three electrons would have a charge of v3+. if you add an electron to it, it converts to a v2+ ion. this transfer of electrons back and forth is what makes vfbs charge and discharge, as the vanadium ions in the battery swing from v2+ to v5+.*  &gt;  &gt;  *this differs from lithium-ion batteries in that every time lithium charges and discharges it is plating and de-plating lithium metal on the cathode. although this reaction is almost completely reversible, it will lead to degradation after a few thousand cycles and performance will decrease.*  *a vfb consists of two tanks of electrolyte dissolved in water and separated by a proton exchange membrane. both electrolytes are vanadium-based. as the batteries are charged and discharged, vanadium ions are simply moved between oxidation states. this can be done tens of thousands of times over a time period measured in decades, with no degradation in the ability of the vanadium solutions to hold charge…*  &gt;  &gt;  *vfbs can charge and discharge multiple full cycles daily for 20 years. even though you may get thousands of cycles with a li-ion battery, for a utility or commercial storage application where daily cycling is needed that may not be enough to give li-ion the advantage…*  *li-ion batteries are great for storing 2-4 hours of energy 50 times a year, but vfbs shine in long-duration applications where energy is required every day; for example, when trying to make solar energy available on demand around the clock.*currently, only about 100 vrfb installations are operating around the world. but the pace of new installations is gaining momentum worldwide. most likely, that pace will ramp up even more as the entire energy storage market expands.the research firm wood mackenzie predicts the global energy storage market will skyrocket between now and 2030 – from a starting point of less than 15 gigawatt-hours to 741 gwh.incidentally, this new forecast is *double* the forecast that bloomberg new energy finance issued about two years ago.parabolic growth trajectories of this scale are rare. to boost energy storage from where it is today to 741 gwh by 2030 would require an annualized growth rate of nearly 40%. that’s *big*.importantly, the steel industry consumes more than 90% of the annual global vanadium supply, leaving less than 10% for all other applications. so it isn’t hard to imagine that additional demand from the energy storage sector could push the vanadium price higher.largo is well positioned to benefit from growing vanadium demand, and could also cash in on growing demand for vrfbs.it is the largest publicly traded pure play on vanadium production. the toronto-based company focuses on the production of vanadium flake and vanadium powder from its maracás menchen mine in bahia state, brazil. the mine has been operating since 2014 and has a mine life of at least 20 years, based on current reserve and resource estimates. but in all likelihood, the actual mine life will be much longer than 20 years.a few key details about this mine:* it is the only operating vanadium mine in the americas.* it holds the highest-grade vanadium deposit yet discovered.* it is one of the lowest-cost producers of the element in the world.vanadium's story is just beginning to attract attention from investors, thanks to its growing role as a “green element”.in the steel industry, vanadium is something of a “wonder element.” steel that contains vanadium is lighter, stronger, and more durable than other steel alloys. just one kilogram of vanadium in a tonne of steel increases its tensile strength by 84%.therefore, building a given structure with vanadium steel requires a smaller volume of steel than building one with a conventional carbon-manganese steel. additionally, producing vanadium steel requires much less energy – i.e., less smoke belching from steelmaking furnaces – than conventional steel.because of these two traits, vanadium steel is more environmentally friendly than conventional steel.thanks to largo’s low cost of production and debt-free balance sheet, it possesses plenty of staying power to endure the current conditions… and then to generate substantial profit growth when vanadium prices firm up.although largo isn’t in the forecasting business, it expects the vanadium price to increase to at least $6.50 a pound over the next year. largo produces all of its revenues from vanadium mining, its share price tends to track closely with the vanadium price. thanks to a recovering steel market and to vanadium’s growing cache as a “green element,” it should attract robust demand growth over the next few years, especially if vrfbs gain market share faster than many industry experts are predicting.as paul vollant, largo’s director of sales and trading, remarked during a recent teleconference:&gt;*looking ahead, largo expects additional vanadium demand growth as a result of recently announced stimulus packages and a focus on carbon footprint reduction globally.*  *these significant long-term trends are forecast to increase the consumption of vanadium in rebar high-quality steel and high-tech applications, as well as through new vanadium redox flow battery deployments around the world…*  *my vision is that higher quality steel is a long-term trend in china and also in other countries in the world. it’s more efficient. its carbon footprint is much lower… so i think demand for vanadium is going to continue to increase tremendously around the world.*i don’t believe largo’s stock price is even close to reflecting the company’s profit potential.based on consensus analyst estimates, largo is trading for just seven times 2021 gross earnings (ebitda). and these estimates anticipate very little improvement in vanadium prices. so if the vanadium price recovers faster and more forcefully than the analysts expect, largo would book much larger profits.all-in, largo shares offer a compelling play on a dynamic corner of the battery metals market.currently holding a big position in this stock. let's ride baby.*i recommend purchasing* ***largo resources ltd.

a lot of retail stores had to shut down, which resulted in less new phone sales, which means less revenue for digital turbine. with the return of the economy and with **the next wave of 5g phones** which will push customers to upgrade phones, the next few years look favorable for the company * mobile posse   * the company acquired mobile posse, which provides carriers like verizon and oems like samsung the ability to show phone users third party content through two products:       * **firstapp** which aggregates different media content and is shown right when a user unlocks the phone       * **firstpage** which shows media content when a user opens the browser    * the transaction closed in february 2020 and is a great complementary add to digital turbine for 3 reasons:       * the deal was extremely fair in price. mobile posse was acquired for $66 million but $24.5 million of that is an estimated earn-out. with the company having generated $59 million in 2019 revenue, the company was purchased **just over 1x revenue which in my opinion is a steal** considering the company has a 5-year cagr of 48% and is profitable       * this acquisition makes digital turbine’s entire ecosystem more attractive to its partners by **extending its product offerings throughout the life of the phone by being able to constantly show users content and ads.** mobile posse’s content products will now consist of around a third of digital turbine’s revenue which is great because it decreases the company’s dependence on app pre-loads.        * one of mobile posse’s primary carrier partners is **t-mobile** which recently merged with **sprint**, and this is the **last major us carrier** that digital turbine doesn’t have major business with. according to the latest earnings call, the ceo remains upbeat about signing t-mobile and sprint as partners, and the acquisition of mobile posse helps makes digital turbine more likely to sign on the carrier, which means more devices and an even stronger partnership network. * international expansion    * the third and most powerful opportunity for growth is international expansion. currently, north america revenue accounts for roughly 65% of the company’s sales, but the **real golden opportunity lies beyond in developing countries where android is the dominant player.**    * in december 2018, digital turbine signed on samsung as a partner, which paved the way for the company to sign on telefonica, telecom italia, america movil, millicom, and at&amp;t mexico in the past 1-2 years. basically, this means digital turbine now **partners with 2/3 of the oems in latin america and an estimated 80% of mobile subscribers through carriers**    * the company also has a partnership with reliance jio, which covers 25% of the 1 billion mobile subscribers in **india** and has a partnership with xiaomi which could lead to partnerships in **china**    * all of this is to say that digital turbine is truly in the beginning stages of its international expansion, and i believe as investors are starting to see the company successfully execute, it’s beginning to draw more attention and hence why it’s stock has shot up over the past year **financials** * in the latest quarterly earnings report, the company reported **quarter over quarter revenue that is up 116%** which is inflated due to the mobile posse acquisition but on a **combined company basis, sales grew by 53%.** * the company also grew **recurring revenue from 10% in the previous year to 40%** which is a really good sign because it means revenue will be more reliable moving forward * the company also reported **43% gross margin** in the quarter as compared to 39% in the previous year, another great sign * company has just about as much debt as cash (\~$17mm) and is **profitable and cash-flow positive** **risks &amp; mitigations** * first, is the **valuation**. digital turbine has experienced some explosive growth over the past year and in order to justify its share price, the company needs to execute well especially with its international expansion which is always tricky       * however, i do think the management team has shown that it has been making all the right moves and i think the path to future growth as i laid out earlier in the video will lead to some nice surprise developments in the next few years * second, in its 10k, one of the biggest risks is that **carriers or oems may start building their own services** to work with advertisers, and if a big customer like verizon or at&amp;t were to pull out their contracts, that would really hurt the company like when tiktok pulled from fastly.    * i think digital turbine is aware of this risk and that’s why it’s working hard to diversify its revenue stream by strengthening its product offerings through the acquisition of mobile posse and expanding internationally * lastly, there’s some criticism that digital turbine products are **bloatware**, and this would only be a problem if customers actually were turning away from devices because of the pre-loaded apps and home screen products digital turbine provides    * customers can always turn off any of digital turbine’s products and delete pre-loaded apps but more often than not, customers end up utilizing the company’s products in one form or another **what i’m doing** * i’ve started a small position in the company a few weeks ago and plan to **hold for the next few years** * valuation looks a bit overstretched so i wouldn’t bet the farm on it at these prices but if the stock does have any major dips, i am going to treat them as major buying opportunities * **company’s earnings report is on february 3rd,** which will be really interesting to see what happens. last quarter, the company reported strong earnings but the stock dropped 16% and rebounded quickly * **if the stock dips to the $30s or $40s, that would be an ideal great time to buy** **resources i looked at:***

531,"the main question here is “should i skip putting money into my 401k if my goal is to retire early?”obviously the tax benefits of a 401k are great when you’re 59 1/2 yrs old, but if i need access to that money to retire early, then i can’t get to it before then without a big penalty. i’m toying around with the idea of doing 3% in 401k for my employer match, but putting any other extra funds into a normal brokerage account so that i can fully access my money when i achieve my financial independence number. otherwise it seems like the funds are locked away where i can’t get to them. which defeats the purpose. i don’t think i’ve ever seen this topic discussed. it seems like everyone maxes out the 401k option first, before making any other separate investments. well if i don’t make enough money to max out the yearly 401k allowance and then significantly invest outside of that, then i’ll never get to retire before 59 1/2. what are people’s thought on this? the secondary question is, if the earliest i could reach my fi number is 55 yrs old, is that throwing away too much money just to retire 4 1/2 years earlier if i did the skip 401k option?",11,1,Investing in non-retirement accounts to gain financial independence,Finance
548,"**intro**this sub often talks about the financial aspects of receiving a windfall, but i want to focus on the emotional aspects of inheriting a large some of money for those who are struggling with the emotions that come with receiving a large sum.  managing your emotions can be as equally important as managing your money and the two often go hand in hand. i would like to share a bit about two different paths that my brother and i took and share some of the emotional struggles i have had with receiving a large sum of money from a young age and how i manage those emotions. i hope that this post can help other people who might have similar feelings to what i have experienced.**brief background**when i was in my first year of college, about 10 years ago, my final grandparent passed away. my brother and i received a lot of money, about 750k each.  by the time i received full ownership of the money at 25 years old, it had grown to 1.2 million due to most of the money already being invested.  **what each of us did after receiving the inheritance**my brother has always been a hard worker and it’s something i admire him for.  he was working in a dead end job he more or less enjoyed, but that didn’t pay well.  he decided to pursue something else a few years after receiving the money and went for his masters degree. he now works at a stable job that pays pretty well and that he loves.  he lives in a hcol area and put down a large down payment on a wonderful house. when i was renting a room from him, he would leave early in the morning and get home later.  he probably put in 50+ hours every week and up to 60+ at times for the first couple of years.   as i said, my brother is a hard worker. there were many days or weeks that were very stressful and he was exhausted when he got home.  but now that he is more settled in the job, he takes off more from work to do the things he wants to do and indulges in some of his more expensive hobbies.  he has no intention of quitting his job and continues to gain a steady income.  on this sub, this is the recommended path. work like you would have done if you hadn’t received a windfall and enjoy the benefits of it growing.   for those of you like me who struggle with the recommended path i’ll share what i have done. i completed college and hopped around trying different jobs. first, i worked a job in my field of study.  then i worked in retail for a bit before i tried a different type of job in my field of study.  i ended up having a mental breakdown in that job.  my next career decision took me to a low cost of living country where i now work teaching english.for whatever reason, i have really struggled with working full time and adapting to adult life.  it could be argued that my inheritance has contributed to that as in full time jobs it’s really hard to stay motivated when rent and satisfying basic needs is not a concern if i leave my job.  it’s easy to transition the thought of “this isn’t worth it” into action.  it’s not that i’m a bad worker.  i always arrived on time to my shifts and rarely slacked off.  but after awhile in a job i start to realize the job isn’t really fulfilling and working for my mental health, and so i look for the next thing that i think will give me a sense of fulfillment.  therefore, i don’t know if i would have adapted to full time work even if i hadn’t received my inheritance.**guilt**there are some problems that come with receiving a lot of money.  i’m not saying these problems are worse than other peoples.  just that there are problems and one of the main ones is the feelings of guilt that can come from receiving a large sum.   over the years, i have felt a lot of guilt, whether from personal or societal pressures. i’m sure some of these aren’t only exclusive to people who have received money, but i still want to share them as i think they are pretty common among people who have received a windfall and are experienced to varying degrees at different times. here is a list of some of those things:1)feeling like i don’t deserve and didn’t earn the windfall.2)feeling like i’m wasting my potential if i don’t do something special with the opportunity the money has given me.3)feeling like my achievements are lesser than others.4)feeling like i have to solve other people’s financial problems.5)feeling bad for spending any of the money.6)feeling like i’m not allowed to have problems.include separate for not having to struggle like other people?**what has helped me with the guilt.**it’s important to work on these feelings of guilt because if you don’t, you risk the chance of making unintelligent decisions.  here are some things that have helped me in the past.1) it’s really interesting how we view what people deserve or don’t deserve.  people tend to think good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people, but the reality is a lot of life is random. so we might look at people working hard to get the same amount of money that was given to us and we feel guilty for not having to make the sacrifices they do. after all, we aren’t better than them so why do we deserve to not work like they do? but remember that the person who chose to give it to you deserved to give their money to whoever they wanted to. so i think it’s important to be constantly thankful for the people or person that gave it to you.  i feel less guilty when i see that money as something that was given to me so i could pursue whatever i want in life that makes me feel fulfilled and happy.  also, one of the things my therapist challenged me on is how to think about the idea of earning money. have i earned my initial net worth by showing up at a job and exchanging my labor for money? no.  but all the additional earnings that my investments make, is earned money in a sense.  not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that every dollar of gains is from money i chose not to spend, even when i could.  2) the idea of potential is often associated with career, but that is only one aspect of your potential.  but because people mainly focus on career potential, people will judge you if you don’t use your money to further yourself in your career or to start a business.  there is really only one potential in your life that i believe matters, and that’s feeling fulfilled and satisfied with life.  so do whatever brings you long term fulfillment and figure out what is truly important for you and distinguish that from what other people think you should be doing.  for me, it’s working for some of my own money while also having a lot of free time to pursue my hobbies and activities.  this obviously changes over time so just be aware that what brings you satisfaction now will probably be different even a couple years from now.  3) guilt about potential plays a bit into guilt about achievements.  it’s easy to look at other people’s achievements and compare them to your own.  when i compare myself to what other people are doing with their lives, it’s easy to think i’m not doing enough and this is amplified with the false belief that because i have the financial resources to do anything i want, it means that i could do anything in life. when really it means that i can pursue anything that i am willing to make sacrifices for.  it’s easy to look at another person’s income on this sub and think ‘wow, if only i put in the effort like that person, i could make 150k+ too.’ but in reality, you don’t know the true amount of effort that that person has put to get there, effort that you might not even be capable of.  you don’t know how many things that person had to sacrifice, the amount of stress they endured, or their goals that motivated them to achieve that level of income.but you know what you have sacrificed for your own personal achievements and they are things you can be proud of.  while it’s important to recognize other people’s achievements, it’s also important to recognize your own achievements and to take the time to be proud of them.4)  my first reaction, and maybe yours too, to hearing someone having financial difficulties is to want to help them.  and if i were to feel guilty about the money i have, i would probably feel obligated to help them out financially.  but constantly doing that would set me on the path to giving all of my money away and prevent me from reaching my own goals.  i have found that most of the time, people end up solving their financial problems on their own and are really just looking to vent. even just offering a listening ear is often a good enough way to help out your friends and family.now i’m not saying don’t ever give money to help people.  i think charity and helping out friends and family is noble and it is something i would like to do more of at some point in my life when i feel more income stable.  what i am saying is don’t ever feel obligated to give money to other people if you don’t want to or aren’t comfortable with it.  personally, i have my own financial and life goals and i’m not comfortable giving away large sums. but, if charity is very important to you, select an amount you are comfortable donating or donate some time to help out.  5) this can especially play off the feeling of not deserving the money you received.  so if you buy anything with ‘unearned’ money then you didn’t really earn that object and you shouldn’t be allowed to enjoy something that you didn’t earn.  but that type of thinking ruins the joy for anything that you spend money on, which is a lot of things in this life.  while i’m not advocating for spending without any care in the world, i am advocating for guilt free spending.   to help prevent overspending, it’s important to still have a budget no matter your level of wealth.  find an amount you are comfortable with spending per month/year and stick to that budget.  for me, i take out enough money to cover my basic needs and a little extra fun money, but i still leave enough to let my windfall continue to grow.  it can be easy to go over the budget when looking at your bank balance, but this is where a lot self-discipline comes into play.  this has serves two purposes: it prevents you from buying things frivolously and over time eroding your windfall.  and it also creates an artificial constraint where you begin to want to earn money.  as i said earlier, having such a large windfall has made money less of a motivation for me, but when i feel a constraint on spending, even an artificial one, it makes me want to earn money with my own skills.  the only exception i make is for important medical related things.developing some sort of professional skills is good and i really recommend any sort of skill that can be freelanced if you struggle with full time work.  it has been important for me to acknowledge that i wouldn’t have been able to pursue this kind of career path had i not received my inheritance.  feeling like i am still having to use my own skills to earn additional money has given me quite a lot of personal satisfaction.6) for the final point of not feeling like i can have my own problems. people are judgmental.  it’s a fact of life.  and people tend to look at those who have been very fortunate as not being allowed to complain about things or have their own problems.  but that’s not true.  are my problems as stressful as someone who has to worry about not making rent and barely being able to feed their family?  hell no! but someone having a more stressful situation than me doesn’t make my problems any less problematic for me.  so it’s okay for you to struggle with the guilt and other emotions that can come with having received a large windfall.   **conclusion**i hope some of the things i have written can help you a bit to navigate the emotions with receiving an inheritance or windfall.  i would be interested to know in what other ways you have felt guilty or other ways in which you were able to manage some of your guilt.",193,1,Dealing with guilt associated with receiving an inheritance,Finance

811,"hello!tldr: i wanna transfer my savings to a roth ira while my financially savvy dad insists that i should stick with the traditional ira. who's right?i (20f) am studying cs in school and have completed an internship at a faang company this past summer. i used a lot of my earnings to pay for school, and ended up saving about $1,500 in the 401k account the company provides thinking that i could take advantage of company matching. i came to realize the matching doesn't apply to interns, and that i didn't save enough for the company to keep the account open, so they rolled over that amount into a traditional ira after my internship was complete.i have been thinking that i should take the money out of the traditional ira, pay taxes on it, and put it in a roth, hoping to only contribute to this roth during my junior and senior year as well, and switch to a traditional ira once i'm out in the industry. my reasoning behind this is that i am in a far lower tax bracket now than i will be after graduation, and likely at retirement (though i don't know when that will be). i made roughly $22k this summer, gross, and expect to be pulling at least 6-figures post graduation at one of these faangs. thus, it makes sense for me to want to pay taxes upfront because i will have to pay fewer taxes now percentage-wise than at any other point in my life.when i told my dad, who taught me a lot of stuff about finances in the first place, he rolled his eyes and told me i was overthinking it. his main argument was that you should always opt to pay taxes later as opposed to now because i don't know anything about what options will be available to me in the future. mainly, he was speaking to the fact that the tax code could be different, or that my assumption that i'll be in a high tax bracket at retirement may not be so valid at that point if i'm living off of capital gains, for instance. i dunno about this, i kind of love working, so i can't imagine not having some income at the time of retirement, though this is 20 year old me speaking on the topic.after i thought about it further, i also realized that the taxes will decrease my principal, and the whole point of saving for retirement early on is to take advantage of the power of compound interest. so, now i'm left wondering if the decreased principle now will counteract the effects of increased taxes later. whatever my decision will be, i'll probably contribute roughly the same $1,500-2,000 to that account for the next couple summers when i'm in school. i know that the sum of money really isn't that significant, i'm treating this decision as more of an intellectual exercise and an opportunity to learn more about tax policy. i'd love to hear your take on this debate because i've been a silent lurker on here for years since my parents instilled in me that money gives you the freedom of choice, something that has always been appealing to me.",2,1,help settle dispute: roth vs traditional ira in niche case,Finance
838,"i’ve been on the fi journey for a few years now. i enjoy keeping up with this sub and listening to fi-centered podcasts.one of the key recurring themes in fi is around expense cutting. fi-enthusiasts float a lot of great ideas around cutting expenses to the bone. i have implemented a lot of these ideas myself, but there is one popular expense item that i won’t compromise on, and that’s cell phone service.i use verizon. they are the most premium brand and i know i can save money by switching to various other low cost providers. however, the reason i will not is simply due to security.as sim swap scams become more prevalent, it’s important you take the necessary precautions to protect yourself. however, there are only so many precautions you can take as an individual. there comes a point that you need to trust that your cell phone provider is doing the right thing. do you trust your low cost cell provider to take the necessary precautions on their end to protect you from a sim swap scam?many of the low cost providers operate on very thin margins. it’s no secret that verizon is a very profitable carrier. this allows them to provide a higher level of service to their customers. i strongly believe that they take sim security far more seriously than other providers. for example, they recently introduced a new feature earlier this year called “number lock” which adds an extra layer of security to sim swapping than what existed previously. basically, if a thief speaks to an associate pretending to be you and passes the normal security check, the associate still won’t be allowed to process a sim swap if you enabled number lock.cell phones are much more than just about being able to make calls and surf the web. they are tied to our financial accounts and thus are an important part of our lives. when deciding on a cell provider, security should be of top concern.",8,1,You shouldn’t skimp on cell phone service,Finance

944,"this post was created for [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/), but is important for anyone trying to understand market movements over the next couple weeks, particularly anyone with exposure to any of the targeted stocks. i'd appreciate if the mods didn't remove it just because it's tangentially connected to another board. the behavior of the dtcc has the potential to effect **everyone** with money in the stock market, not just the wsb people gambling on meme stocks. if anyone wants to help figure this all out, it's appreciated.i'm not a fan of vlad, but this might not ultimately be his fault and if we are going to actually get this fixed, we need to go after the people who actually made the decisions that created this situation; the depository trust &amp; clearing corporation. the dtcc owns the dtc, depository trust company, which is the primary platform trading occurs on. over 95% of all stock, options and securities trades in the us are handled by the dtc.the dtc issued a rule to clearing houses like citadel on thursday that they needed 100% margin on $gme (and all the other short squeeze meme stocks) buy orders, as explained by the webull ceo on benzinga. clearing houses each have 2 day ""clearing periods"" each week that vary from clearing house to clearing house. this means brokers which have been allowing trading on $gme will stop as soon as their clearing house is in it's clearing period, which will start on monday or tuesday for the brokers that have not halted buys yet. brokerages are only able to trade $gme and the other limited stocks by essentially borrowing enough money from banks to match every dollar we spend on the stocks we like, which is how robinhood was able to allow limited purchases until they apparently ran out of money. again. rh could have allowed unlimited buys until they ran out of money, but that would have turned into a few people consuming all potential shares as soon as this information was public knowledge.the explanation behind the rule from the dtc is to prevent a market failure where someone selling their share would not receive money for it, which could happen, but the dtcc, dtc's owners, are the ones allowing naked shorts in the first place through ""failure to deliver"" stock sales. they should carry the ultimate financial responsibility of allowing this situation to exist. the dtcc is desperately trying to cover up the fraud they've been facilitating for decades and the only reason we can see it now is because they are running out of options.if the dtcc is forced to end the practice of failure to deliver stock sales, or put restrictions on it, the value of all securities with significant short interest could see massive spikes in value as the short positions are forced to close. if the dtcc is allowed to continue this practice, hedge funds will continue being able to drive otherwise stable companies into bankruptcy through market manipulation and financial restriction.the only mistake vlad made was trying not to look underfunded on national television, which also made it much harder to find out what was actually going on, and likely guaranteed that he will remain underfunded for the remainder of eternity even if he's lucky enough to avoid jail time.we have a chance to recreate the entire financial system in the image of dfv but it won't happen if we waste our energy trying to get vlad to pay for our tendie party from inside a prison cell. there's way to many moving pieces here for me to figure it out, i'm retarded, but someone here is probably less retarded, or at least, i'm willing bet 75% of my life savings on it. like i said. i'm retarded.if we don't get this sorted out by monday, the shorts might pull something we don't see coming in addition to all the people who just moved to td potentially being locked out again. holding isn't enough, we need to fight the meta war.36 shares $gme 20 @ $40 16 more @ $200i'm not selling till $128,128.69 after this.",7,1,"The limits on $GME may not be the fault of Robinhood, Webull and other brokers.

17,"good afternoon everyone. this is probably going to be very long. but for whoever decides to read it all and reply i really appreciate you...i have a lot of alone time on my hands and it has caused me to think about my future and begin to worry...i'm 19 years old and i'm currently in school still. however i will be graduating may 2021, because i took a lot of college classes in high school, and over the summer to allow me to graduate 2 years earlier than the rest of my class. i'm pretty fortunate that my parents provided me with a car, education, and pay for my gas, car insurance, phone bill, etc. because of this i've been able to save all the money i earned from working in high school. i've always saved my money and didn't spend it on silly things. i also flipped sneakers in high school and made at least 15k doing so. i stopped focusing on sneakers when i learned about stocks in college. i had about 35k in savings, but lost quite a bit taking high risk investing in stocks because i'm young and wanted to take the risk but definitely made some stupid mistakes. it was upsetting, but i've accepted it. and i do not believe in having regrets, because i would have never known what would happen. i'm currently finishing up school and seeking an internship/full time employment. i'm currently collecting $150 per week in unemployment. i have a good amount of time on my hands that i've been spending at the gym, spending time with my brother, and family and trying to not think about money all the time and just enjoy my life now.however, i keep running into the problem that i'm having trouble enjoying things now because worrying about my future is always stuck on the back of my head. ultimately what i'm worried about is not achieving all my goals, and i have set the bar pretty dang high for myself. starting to realize it may be unrealistic can be upsetting, but i still genuinely believe in them all...anyway here's some more i'm struggling with... in about 5months or so my little brother will begin to drive and will take my car. my parents will help my purchase a new one... i can get a quality car and save my money, or i can spend about 15k of my own money too and get a very nice car. i currently have about 23k-28k, i'm not sure of the exact number. but buying a car will put me down to 8k-13k. the only con i see in this it will delay me a little bit from being able to put a downpayment on a house.i know dave ramesy would look at me like i'm crazy with this... i should probably just not put any of my own money towards a car and be happy with what i get. what i would get would still be a very nice car. but here is my ""argument"" i guess you would say for justifying the car purchase. the money i have is from working in high school and flipping sneakers. most kids my age spend it on alcohol, going out to eat, and overpriced sneakers and stuff. i saved all my money... also i feel like the money for a downpayment on a house is made mainly from my first steady paying job, not the money i made as a cashier in highschool you know?i'm looking for a full time job and i'm also concerned about my starting salary, and even salary after a few years. i'm living home with my parents and would save up for a downpayment. i guess it's time to get into my goals now. i really would like a nice house maybe 500-600k.. i know someone mentioned to me that this was a lot for being young and single at the moment. i don't believe in renting because i'd rather live at home and save money. and i don't want to put a downpayment on a house that i don't want to keep forever because i feel that is a waste of money as well... maybe not though because i could flip it... but also meeting a significant other, i'm not sure when that will happen. i'm planning everything as if i will have no financial help from them, but idk if that's stupid or not and adding to my stress. it's weird, i'm not sure if i should purchase a house alone and then try to meet someone, or meet someone while i'm still living at home. it's a little weird to have someone at my parents house.. i wouldn't want to jump into buying a house with someone if i'm unsure we will stay together forever you know?so after the downpayment, i would have to pay my mortgage over time... the price of the house would all depend on my salary... and i learned my salary would need to me more than my mortgage, living expenses, and also 6k to max out a retirement account roth ira.. and maybe even more for a 401k... i know i haven't been successful with stocks really, but i learned a lot and i'm ready to stop making high risk dumb decisions and get serious with etfs and high quality companies consistently investing in a roth ira. or some sort of retirement account as soon as i get my first job. now... after all these expenses i still need to be saving money for things i want to make me happy...  but like i just said... i had about 36k but lost 8k in stocks.... it was at one point only 5k but i tried to get it back all too quick and too fast which resulted in dumb decisions... i don't want to fall into that trap again... i've accepted the loss and see myself starting fresh now with 23-28k in savings.... also depending in the 15k car purchase... i'd like to start a roth ira/401k, but i think that would be easier with a steady income... i'm also wondering how everyone else invests? max out the 401k employer match, then max roth ira, then the rest of the 401k? and then i wonder if people have their own individual self brokerage that isn't a retirement account that they invest in too.. but yeahthe other thing, 2020 has showed us how unexpected life can be and just... getting a nice car now would be one goal checked off the list... and i could start to enjoy it now. instead of having to wait and possibly never getting it because anything could happen.but back to saving for things i'd want and that make me happy... i mean... buying furniture and stuff for a house and anything that needs to be redone needs to be factored in, and also i know i said i set the bar high for myself but a boat maybe like 20k... if i'm able to keep a large enough savings pool...also, i want to be able to afford starting a family, and being able to provide for my kids just how my parents provided for me and my siblings. i know i'm young, and for some reason worrying about this instead of going to the park and playing football with my friends and enjoying my life in the present...the best advice i got was.. as long as you take little steps everyday towards your long term goals you should be happy... all that is in my power is to finish up school which i am and save my money which i am... besides that i feel there's nothing in my power. i know i was all over the place, and this was very long. i know i set the bar high for myself and i know i'm already very fortunate. complaining that i'm only getting this car instead of that car, and worried i won't have a boat. i should just be thankful i have a car and stuff in the first place, but i'm still shooting for high goals... i don't mean to sound ungrateful. if you don't have anything nice to say please keep your comments to yourself. or maybe actually, knock some sense into me so i could stop taking things for granted. i hope some people could help my find clarity. thank you.",6,1,19 Years

305,"from what i've gathered, if you are in a low-income tax bracket currently (let's say 10-12% federally), roth contributions are the way to go. you'll get taxed on this money now, but the investment will grow tax-free, and you won't get taxed on it once you take it out for retirement, as long as you are already 59 and a half years old. this is common knowledge. as your income and salary steadily increases, however, the traditional ira/401(k) seems to become a better option. the tax-deferred quality of these options will put more money in your pocket now to help compound later on in the future. but, you'll need to pay taxes on it once you take it out, which could be a significant portion depending on what tax bracket you are in upon retirement. &amp;#x200b;this is the information that i have become familiar with in the past few years or so. however, after reading jl collins' ""the simple path to wealth,"" i am beginning to reconsider how long one should wait to convert their roth accounts to traditional accounts. the money that is spent on getting taxed first could be used for compounding year after year, which could grow one's nest egg even quicker. this almost has me thinking that even people in low-income tax brackets (the 10-12% federal level as mentioned earlier) may be well-advised to start with traditional iras/traditional 401(k)s to enjoy tax-deferment immediately. of course, this will be taxed when they are at the retirement age, but by then, will the extra cash that is compounded over the next few decades outweigh the taxation amount at retirement?&amp;#x200b;**tldr; title:** is there a hard-and-fast golden rule or key salary level in which one should switch to traditional accounts to enjoy the tax-deferment?",15,1,Is there a golden rule or key salary point in which one should switch from Roth IRA/Roth 401(k) contributions to tax-deferred Traditional IRA/401(k) contributions instead?,Finance

799,"the breakup happened 2 years ago. now that i've made some progress, and have some wiggle room, i was hoping to get a bit of input on my plans.the situation i was in.  36m (38 now) disabled (just over $1000 usd income). a few years prior to my ex leaving we had bought an rv and truck together (full time rvers, emergency purchase). at this point we had been together for close to 15 years, so i trusted her to handle the finances. there were a lot of unexpected bills that went along with buying the rv. and quite a few repairs to the truck. this led to quite a bit of credit card debt. but she was paying it off. or so i thought. she ended up slipping into hidden alcoholism, and no progress was made.the year she left, she talked me into paying for repairs to the truck under the guise of needing it to get a job (she had been a full time caregiver for her disabled children until they hit 18). i later found out that she was leaving. i got the rv, she got the truck (for the rv her mother gave her). i didn't fight it since i don't drive. i also didn't fight all the other bills, because it was a complex situation involving step-kids.when she left i had 1. 25000 left on an rv loan2. 6300 on a us bank platinum visa (6400 max)3. 1700 on an american express green card which had already fallen behind and closed 4. 2600 on a national tire chain card already behind5. $0 on a paypal credit account ($500 max)plus a truck loan that she was paying off.&amp;#x200b;after my basic needs, i had enough to pay the visa, and nothing else. this was also my first time handling my finances on my own. i made it through the first year with almost no progress.i started 2020 with 95% credit utilization. the amex is still closed, but hasn't been sent to collections (they still offer to give me a new card if i can repay). the tire card was sent to collections. still 1000 a month income, plus what i can earn on beer money type sites. plus a very short term part time job. when the stimulus was announced i decided i would put it towards the visa to try to get ahead, and lower the minimum payment. this made it possible to actually make extra payments over the summer. it's been nice watching the utilization go down slowly. at the beginning of the shutdown the collections agency who held my tire debt (and never contacted me about it) suddenly sued me. no legal aid available due to covid, and my county didn't see a need to push back court dates. despite not being able to enter the courthouse or having zoom sessions. so they did manage to get a judgement against me.because of my disability i was given covid rental and energy assistance for the winter. not really something i wanted to take, but at that point we were facing more shutdowns and instability. again, i used the extra money to try to bring the minimum payments down to a point where if need be i can skip paying extra to help cover any extras that arise. because of the judgement my available credit has become my emergency savings. so where i am now. 1. rv payments are current.2. 2200 on the us bank visa3. amex still waiting4. 2750 judgement with a collections agency5. $80 on paypal credit (i use the 6 months no interest for home repairs)my credit score had improved considerably. but, my ex decided to skip paying the auto loan during november and december. (she claims repairs, but i'm not sure i trust her) she caught up early this month. which cost me most of the score progress i've made in the past year. now that i have a bit more stability i am trying to decide on my next steps. my instinct is to continue paying down the visa as fast as i can to get rid of the interest charges. then work on the amex, since my pay is not garnishable.the deal with the truck has made things more complicated, because i don't like her having the ability to influence my finances. there are 5 payments left. she's dying, at least, she says she is. (metastatic colon cancer) if she does, the truck reverts to me. before i knew she was sick i had told her that i wouldn't sign the truck over to her unless she paid the repair related debts. her response was that she was dying, so i could sell it to cover everything she owes me. but now that i can't even trust her to make the payments...  if another stimulus comes through there is a temptation just to finish paying it and write her off completely. at least then i wouldn't have to worry about scrambling to make payments if she dies before paying it off.

2095,"yesterday was my 50th birthday, and it was a good time to sit and think about the future and my looming retirement. i am unsure if i am really on track, so i would love a little expert advice/analysis. about me: 50 year old us citizen expat living and working in switzerland. wife, one high school aged child and one starting university now (university here is very inexpensive so not really a contributing factor to the economics). chemist by training, but currently a manager of scientists in the pharmaceuticals business. retirement is mandatory here at age 65. income (all pre-tax in usd): 255k per year, bonus of about 80k per year, 25k in stock and options. this is rather recent, as previously income was closer to 100k for 15 years or so with no bonuses. wife does not work. debt: zero debt. cash on hand: approximately 50k usd in liquid cash in the bank. perhaps another 80k for tax liability (swiss do not withhold taxes, so i have to do it), but this has to go to the swiss government and is not really liquid. i have an emergency fund in the us with another 30k in it to handle things where i need a us bank account. retirement savings: 480k in usa 401k fidelity account, 120k in employer stock, 205k in swiss company pension fund to date. swiss pension will vest when i turn 65 and i am retired (you can't work longer here), at a final value of 1,250,000 usd (or 62k per year income upon surrender until i die, wife would continue to get half of that until she dies). i only contribute about 1k usd a month, and employer contributes 4k. additional non-retirement investment accounts of about 45k with schwab. wife has a small 401k with about 30k in it. i think total retirement savings is around 880k. due to challenges between swiss-us taxes, anything i could put into a us ira or whatever would still be taxed by the swiss. the tax treaty means i pay swiss taxes first, then the difference to the us. this makes a lot of tax deferred investments difficult. contributions: about 5k per month to swiss pension (me 1k, plus employer 4k). i also put 2k per month into the schwab account since the new higher income job started. i also put 700 usd a month into company stock purchase (at a 30% discount price). other assets: i do not own a home. goal is to retire at 65 and enjoy life in switzerland as a permanent resident. an income of about 150k per year would be good, but switzerland is expensive, so maybe 200k would be ideal. i am maxed out on us social security, which i can collect here as a us citizen. i also would get swiss pillar one avs retirement, which would be around 19k per year for my time contributing to their system. pension and investments would have to make up the rest. so, how fucked am i? i know i have some money in retirement, but i have no home equity building or the like. my job gave me a great income, but only rather recently, so i'm sure i am way behind. any advice? should i save more? do i need a financial planner? it feels like i am in over my head and could use some advice.",5,1,"I turned 50 yesterday, and I am worried about retirement",Finance

2593,"my wife and are have reached the age where retirement is starting to become less of an abstract concept and we are beginning to consider our ""real"" target retirement ages and what our lives will look like at that point. as i reviewed where we stood at the end of 2020, i feel pretty good about where we are, but i'm left wondering if we are missing something obvious, in terms setting ourselves up for an earlier retirement than we are actually forecasting.  i'm a longtime pf lurker and thought i'd speak up and ask for some input on our situation.here is a summary of where we stand at the end of 2020:married coupleboth age 36 (wife is ~6 months younger.) located in mid-west, moderate cost of living area. 2 children, ages 4 and 6.combined income of ~$200,000 gross. we see relatively small, but fairly consistent raises. both of us are fairly highly compensated relative to our jobs and local market, making job hopping locally fairly unlikely. we currently max our hsa, dependent care fsa, and contribute ~$24,000 / year to our combined 401ks. our employers add roughly another $8000 in matching (we are taking full advantage of any matches). we try to up our contributions 1% each year. only debt is our mortgage. recently refinanced $297,000 for 30 years at 3.0%. home is worth roughly $500,000. our major expenses are:childcare (avg ~$1150 / mo over the year)mortgage (payment, plus taxes and insurance is roughly $2000 /mo) home improvement (we've been putting quite a bit of work into the house the last couple years. i'd estimate it averages out to $1000 / mo for the 3.5 years we've been living there. given our plans for the house, i'd consider this expenditure fairly static for the foreseeable future.)upcoming major expenses (18-24 months) would be a new roof and replacing one of our cars. we typically buy cars new or very lightly used and drive them 10+ years. current cars are 8 and 10 years old. i do almost all of our home and auto repair, so we can keep many of those costs relatively low. our combined retirement accounts (two 401ks and a roll-over ira total $425,000. other assets include roughly $50,000 in cash and $15,000 in private company stock. currently after all expenses, we save roughly $1000 per month in cash. after looking all this over, i feel pretty good about where we stand at this point in our lives. clearly i expect our child care and home improvement spending to go down with time, though other low frequency purchases (vehicle, home roof, etc.) would likely fill that void. what i'm wondering, is if there is any low hanging fruit we are missing in terms of moving towards retirement in an intelligent manner. the thought of retirement in our late 50s sounds great and i'm pretty sure our current 401k balance plus future contributions at least makes that plausible. i know we could consider roth iras, but i feel as though at our income level, the tax situation may not make that as much of a clear cut decision. am i wrong there? aside from continuing to increase our 401k contributions, is there something else we should be doing? is there something we should do instead of increasing the 401k contributions? i understand that we can always work toward reducing expenses in the pursuit of saving more and living on less, which also moves up your retirement date. at this point, however, i'm focusing more on the way are are allocating the money we are saving and confirming that we see indeed on the path that i think we are. any input or advice would be greatly appreciated!",4,1,Mid-30s Couple Retirement Planning - Could we be making smarter choices?,Finance

3232,"hi all, i'll try to keep this brief. i'm using this throwaway account to hopefully get some advice discretely. here goes:earlier this year, i took a chance and left my current w-2 salaried job w/ benefits to join a company with some people that i had previously worked with. they are a small company and couldn't pay me as much, but had a lot of upswing vs. my current job at the time which was (and continues to be) decimated by the pandemic. that said, they were competitive enough and a chance to earn a company performance based bonus after my first 12 months every quarter, so i gladly signed on. i was originally setup as 1099 and i received a lump sum each month with no withholding, per my employment agreement. i paid my first set of estimated taxes including self-employment tax (15.3%) to the irs on time, no problem at all.in passing over various points this year, the person that runs payroll told us that they had intended on converting me and some others to w-2 and receive bi-monthly checks instead before the end of the year. when the time came, i filled out all my forms including w-4 (filing jointly, held multiple jobs over last 12 months so some math there) and i-9. i received my first paycheck and noticed that my gross was less than my previous lump sum payment i received as a 1099. when i asked about it the person running payroll noted that since the business was now paying half of what i previously covered via self-employment (other half is still withheld from me) and that my net 'take-home' pay is the same, but will show less on the paystub than what i previously received. is this an issue, or am i overthinking it? i understand the logic and reasoning, however i was not consulted or told that my gross in effect was going to be reduced by half of ~15% for a business cost. i don't believe this was malicious or intentionally deceitful as i have a good rapport with everyone at my company...but shouldn't a reduction in my gross to cover what is essentially a business cost be at least ran by me first?additionally, while the net pay will effectively be the same i can no longer write off half of the self-employment tax anymore as a w-2 vs. 1099. career-wise it also looks like i just made way less than what i did to the point where it feels like a setback more than i anticipated. i'm thinking about just asking for them to make my gross back to the previous amount and that i should not have to pay the business's portion of my employment tax.",7,1,Gross pay reduced unexpectedly for taxes,Finance

4510," on december 18th, i had been working overnight at a 7-eleven in chicago, when i was punched in the face while throwing out a couple of shoplifters who had tried to shoplift a half hour earlier but came back.     the punch immediately knocked me out and i fell on the concrete floor below me. according to surveillance footage, i got up about 10 seconds later and then proceeded to talk with a witness who chased off the two shoplifters as well as the cops who arrived shortly afterwards. i specifically say that this happened “according to surveillance footage”, because i do not actually have my own, visceral memory of this event. i do not remember the entire second encounter with these shoplifters, nor do i remember talking to the witness, the cops, or the ems in the ambulance. it appears that the cops judged me to be too out of it to not call an ambulance and they were probably right.     when i woke up at the hospital hours later (i guess i fell asleep at some point after getting into the ambulance), i had thought i was there because of some traffic accident, because that seemed to be the most likely reason, and i was unable to recall anything that happened prior. i also had no idea how much time had passed since my last memory, so i had no way of knowing whether my last memory was from the same day, the day before, and so on. as a result, i was kind of laying there, waiting to wake up from a dream, because my location made absolutely no sense to me. but, i never woke up. instead, one of the medical residents informed me that i had been assaulted while at work. i was diagnosed with a concussion and a facial fracture.     since leaving the hospital, i received two calls from a detective and one call from a prosecutor. it looks like that the two shoplifters were arrested, they are juveniles, and i can only assume that they are related as they share the same last name in the police report. over the past 72 hours, i must have slept through like half of them.     now, i think you can guess that i'm dreading to see the hospital bill. i'm also dreading to find out the chances of that money being able to be recovered from the offenders. in chicago, or rather illinois specifically, there is a thing called the “crime victims compensation program”, which, going forward, i need to find out if i'm eligible and to see how much of a dent that would make in covering my medical expenses. oh, and, no insurance here on my part. so as of now, there are still a lot of things up in the air such as what the total medical bill will be, and whether or not the offenders will be convicted.       financially, any advice on what else i should do or keep in mind going forward?",93,1,Upcoming Medical Bills Due to Violent Crime,Finance

4752,"hi, everyone. i’ll try to keep this as succinct as possible.i’m almost 24 (f). i have loving parents who pay for my everything and always have, but i want to become independent and move out soon. because i’m so dependent they have rules and expectations (not allowed to date, for example, among others) that i think impede my growth and freedom as an adult that’s unhealthy for my age. never minding the rules, the dependence and delay in life experiences alone is unhealthy i think.i graduated college in 2019 with a music performance degree. music was the most interesting thing for me to major in, the college was cheap and local and i got good scholarships there, i learned a lot, but because the degree was in classical singing and i’ve learned that my interests are in pop/contemporary singing, im training my voice in this style for my future career. however, covid has shut down performance opportunities whether pop or opera so it’s not possible to earn money from this right now anyway.aside from one being retired and the other having another job, my parents have a fiction writing business and i help out a lot (edit all books, help with illustrations, etc.), but to be honest, we have yet to be profitable. also, for the past 8 months, i work online (about 5 hours a day) for minimum wage pay as an esl tutor, just to earn some money during covid.that’s the background. my question.i’m considering creating my own business (most likely non music related because training and networking will take years before becoming profitable) since i have time and a great safety net to do this, and hopefully it can become my reliable income by time i move out (which i’d like to do in 1.5 years in the latest).but, i don’t have any strong ideas what the business could be. i always imagined this business being my income while i travel and slowly develop my music career on the side, and my parents have always encouraged entrepreneurship, but i’m so stuck right now.i could stay at home and keep working for my family business, but who knows how long that will take for it to be profitable, and that would also delay my adult independence. it would have to be staying at home because my parents aren’t comfortable with sending manuscripts through email for editing (possibility of someone else stealing or seeing their work before released), so i would actually have to stay home.and i could also get a full time job, or waitress or something, but yet my parents are highly concerned about covid and wouldn’t let me get an in person job right now, and i wonder if finding a remote one would be difficult. the car i drive is also their car, technically, so they have ultimate say over this. furthermore, if i have time to create a business i’d like to take that chance instead, but again, i’m stuck at what to do.not to mention that everyone says “travel when you’re young”, which i plan on doing 100% financially funded by me, but i feel like i’m both stuck in this current predicament and also losing years to do this young traveling.any advice for my situation would be very much appreciated.**tl;dr -- i've depended on my parents for my entire life and now need to be independent. stuck between creating my own business, getting a job, or staying and working for the family business.**",3,1,Trying to go from spoiled dependence to adult independence.

could have a gun, a knife, or his friend in the other car had something waiting for me.i kept trying to calm him down and talk about his life situation, but came to the realization that it was just all bullshit from the way he couldn't describe certain things. every now and then he would start to get mad at me and threaten to kick me out of the car and beat me up, but i tried to dismiss it and focus the conversation on the car.then i started to think he didn't actually have any cash and was trying to intimidate me into just giving the title to him. he started making texts while saying ""all right, this is what we're going to have to do then.""finally, i have never been so thankful to see police suvs in my life. it was like the cavalry was showing up. i immediately got out of the car with my hands up walking towards the officer and directed him to the driver. i quickly explained what was going on and spilled the past hour in about 10 seconds, it was such a relief.they just had the potential buyer give his license to the officer and question him for a bit. the officers really weren't taking him as seriously as i thought, especially when he was just explaining what a desperate situation he was. they also were chatting about craigslist and the company's policy and i couldn't believe it. i probably would have been more mad, but i was just mostly relieved to be out of the car with him.they had me stand in front of another police cruiser in the cold. there was probably a lot more nerves than low temperature, but i was shaking like a leaf. he claimed he forgot something in the car and asked to go get it. i got scared what he might tried to do, but the officers wouldn't let him. he claimed he forgot his cell phone, but they couldn't find it in there.then they told him to drive off, but he started searching his own vehicle first and that's when shit got more real. i told the officers to watch him and what he might be getting. i started walking behind the nearest cop who started gripping his pistol. i was genuinely scared there was going to be a shooting so i ducked behind the police cruiser. i told the other officers to watch out for him because he threatened to do something drastic without the car and they started paying more keen attention. he ended up just slinking back into his driver's seat sand his driver drove away.i still didn't want to leave until he was away from the parking lot and out of sight. the cops ended up forgetting to write down his license plate so had to try to follow him to find him again. they ended up all leaving me in the parking lot so i finally thought i needed to get out of there.tldr: take every precaution when meeting people on craigslist, especially for big sales/buys. cash only, cameras, well populated area, daytime, bring another friend or two, have another on spend by, and trust your instincts to leave an unsafe situation. you are not obligated to anyone over a business transaction.(sorry for the length and

5424,"hi everyone,i visited an ent in my area in late november. the reason why being... i've been looking into getting some dental work to fix some crowding in my lower palate from when i was younger, but they wanted to make sure my sinuses were ok due to the fact that i have seasonal allergies/mild asthma/etc. since i was a kid. they sent me to a local, well-known ent to have my sinsues checked.when i arrived at the clinic, i deftly remember them telling me that all i had to pay for this first visit was $200.00 and any other payment was never mentioned throughout that first appointment... no number, dollar value whatsoever was mentioned. i paid the $200.00 right then and there for that visit, out of pocket. i got a medical bill today from that ent clinic with the following ""description of service"" payments. here they are:* ""31231 nasal endoscopy dxunibil sep proc"" = charges of **$871.02*** ""99203 level 3new patient100"" = charges of **$302.76**that is a total of: **$1,173.78**they also have my payment listed of **$200.00** and that is deducted from that $1,000+ total payment... but there is *another* payment listed there as the following:* ""stmg/adi self pay oct 19"" = payment of **$469.51**therefore, i have a balance due of: **$504.27**so... here are my questions:\- as i said earlier, i do not recall whatsoever that any other payment was to be required of me besides that $200.00 at that first appointment. like, i legitimately remember asking multiple times what was to be required of me in the form of payment. the ent did check out my sinuses with a few tools but no actual procedure took place, as far as i understand. the dentist that i was referred to him from actually performed a cbct scan of my teeth and thus, a portion of my sinuses showed up on that scan and that is why they had me go to the ent in the first place. if i asked multiple times if i was going to be required to pay more during the visit and not told that i would be, how is this possible? and what can i do about it?\- what do these ""31231"" and ""99203"" codes mean and how can i learn more about them to know exactly how they apply to any visits i might have medically in the future? i have terrible seasonal allergies and knowing how these things work from a payment/financial side would be super beneficial. any blatant insight or any links to step by step information or learning of how these codes and service descriptions apply to ent or medical visits?... much appreciated!\- what is this ""stmg/adi self pay""? again, something i wasn't foretold about and would love to get some answers for. i'm in my early 20's, i don't currently have health insurance, but i was able to thankfully pay that $200.00 out of pocket because i thought seeing an ent would be beneficial for me. what is this self pay of $469.51 from?in the end, i can pay for this $500+ charge... but what the hell? how do you avoid getting into these situations when you are trying to seek medical assistance and they won't tell you straight forward what you are paying for? especially when it's this large of an amount. is this legal? if not, what resources can i head to have this dealt with, if any? thanks, reddit! hope 2021 is treating you well so far. \- namaste",15,1,"Medical bill question - ""31231 Nasal Endoscopy"" and ""99203...New Patient"" Codes, Questions?!",Finance

(my anxiety is rooted in my money issues, go figure)all of that has been manageable so far! however, this is where the issue comes in. starting this month, i have to pay my private student loans to sallie mae. i have 5 loans from them (\~$66,000), cosigned by my parents, and it averages $800 a month.starting next month, (unless deferred again) i will need to pay \~$200 in federal loans each month. combined with my private loans, that is more than my rent each month, and i just don't know how to do it or figure out how to (if it's possible) to budget with that in mind! i've tried to look into (private) loan refinance/consolidation, however, i do not have high enough credit to apply myself (missed some payments this summer and have medical debt i was not aware of - on a payment plan for), and my parents, who agreed to cosign for me, do not have a large enough income to qualify to cosign. i have applied through multiple institutions, and they have all rejected me and my cosigner, and cited those two reasons. my hail mary solution that i have tried now is applying with only 3 of my most expensive sallie mae loans, hoping that the ""smaller amount"" would work with my parents' income. however, we still got denied that application. i am actively working to try to boost my credit, by making my missing payments. my credit score is currently 579, which is 11 points higher than its lowest! (yay), but however, dropped from 734 in june of this year. i am working full time as a teacher, and i have been looking for tutoring work on the side. i just got hired at a thrift store on the weekends for $7.25 an hour, but need to wait for covid test results to come back before i can begin onboarding there. i also think that i could make better use of my time perhaps than at such a low-paying job, but at this point i'm desperate. i also have been trying to get involved in online focus groups and very recently took a job with appen, which is online work that helps train ai. i am really trying. &amp;#x200b;so, that's all background info! this is where the post will take several different routes, as i have several different questions:\- is it possible to budget with my rent, bills, and loan payments? what would that look like? &amp;#x200b;\- what are some actual side hustles i could do to earn more money? i've been looking at job sites nightly, and i can't find any good **weekend** work during a pandemic. &amp;#x200b;\- my solution, so far, has been to apply for egg donation. i just want to shove as much money towards the sallie mae loans as possible. good/bad idea? my family thinks this is a very rash decision, but this is something i have been considering since my freshman year of college. i know you can do several cycles (if it goes well), which could make my loans seem much more manageable. &amp;#x200b;i know everyone has loans, and struggles with money, but this feels like too much. i feel like i'm constantly drowning. i was at a really good place in my life before, but since my loan payments are coming up it's all that's on my mind and i get so anxious. it's such a daunting amount of money and i have no idea what to do. please, help me. i know i'm not that young, and i should know better by now, but i'm trying to learn and be better. none of this is easy for me.",7,1,I don't know what to do!

7989,"although mutual fund doesn’t offer guaranteed returns, but they are still better investment options then traditional ones. so, mutual fund are best for small investors who don’t have much knowledge and expertise to directly invest in shares in stock market.this post will cover basic to advance topics related to mutual fund so even a beginner could understand it. this post is written only for educational purpose to spread awareness about mutual funds. we are not providing any investment tips here.benefits of investing in mutual fund:mutual fund schemes gives higher returns than fixed deposit, gold and real estate investment.mutual funds are relatively more liquid than gold and fixed deposit. here liquidity means you can buy and sell your asset with ease. gold is physical asset so it have less liquidity relatively.most mutual fund schemes have no lock in period. that means you can withdraw your invested money anytime.if you buy any property you have to pay registration cost but in case of mutual fund there is no registration cost.mutual funds are regulated by sebi and amfi. so your money is very safe as sebi is government body, there is very low chances of default.it is very secure compare to gold. as gold is physical asset and it could get steal.mutual funds are best and easiest way to invest in international market.mutual funds are generally liquid.there are various types of mutual funds like:gilt funds which invests in government bonds which generally have maturity period of 3-5 years or junk bonds which are risky but provide higher returns with low maturity period. while floating rate funds are changing by interest rate. liquid funds are just like saving accounts which generally have maturity period of up to 91 days and liquid funds have no lock-in period.hybrid funds invest in both equity and debt , hybrid funds invest majority of their asset in equity funds as they are looking for growth, the reason behind to invest in rest of the asset into debt is to to reduce risk. as there are so many different types of funds, there was a need to characterize them. mutual fund could be characterize in multiple ways. that’s what we will cover in this post.there are two types of fund:debt fundequity fundtypes of debt funds:gilt funds:invest in government securities with varying maturity (15 to 30 year). nav is volatile. after maturity period ends rbi gives money back to investors and then withdraw government securities from them. returns of these funds are highly sensitive to interest rate movements. if interest rate falls then gilt bonds goes up.liquid fund:liquid fund have no lock-in period so one can withdraw money anytime. and it also have no exit load. liquid funds mostly invest in commercial papers and government bonds not directly in stock market.liquid funds are similar to savings account but provide higher returns usually around 7-8%. here risk is very low as governments bonds are involve. sometimes, fd and liquid fund’s returns are almost same.income funds:as name suggest it gives periodic returns. good for those who are looking for regular income.fixed maturity plans:in fixed maturity plans maturity period is fixed just, like fixed deposit. and this fund also provide tax benefit.types of equity funds:1] equity diversified funds:diversified equity fund invest in small cap, mid cap as well as in large cap equity funds.2] elss fund:elss has lock-in period of 3 years, and also offers taxation benefit. elss fund is good for tax deduction. one can save tax here under section 80 c. it provides 1,50,000 limit of exemption from total taxable income3] sector fund:sector fund as name suggest it invest only in one particular sector. so, they are most risky as investment is not diversified.4] global fund:global funds are international funds which invests in international markets.balance funds:balance funds are funds which invest in both equity and debt. balance funds ensure returns but generally have high expenses. balance funds are relatively less volatile. they also do not provide tax benefit like elss funds.there is another way to characterize mutual funds:active fundspassive fundsactive funds are funds manage by fund manager actively while passive funds are not actively managed by fund managers. in case if you are wondering, who is fund manager?fund manager is a person who invest in stock market in unit holder’s behalf.index funds are example of passive funds where fund managers almost copies index like bse sensex or nifty 50 with some tracking error.what is bse sensex ? it is nothing but a group of 30 companies shares with different proportions. while nifty 50 index is a group of 50 companies shares with different proportions.there are two types of mutual fund schemes:open ended schemesclose ended schemesopen ended schemes have no time frame, one can buy units anytime, anyday. here, liquidity is very high. liquidity in layman’s terms means one can easily and quickly buy and sell these fund’s units. while close ended schemes have fixed time frame, one can’t buy units after nfo (new fund offer). so in close ended scheme liquidity is low.fixed maturity plan are close ended fund with less risk as they mostly invest in government bonds and top corporate bonds.capital protected fund are also close ended which provides guaranteed returns. they invest 90% of their asset in equity and around 10% in government bonds.exchange traded funds are hybrid of open ended and close ended mutual funds.what is an amc ?amc (asset management company) invests client funds into securities. amc is basically an mutual fund company. amc is a trust which hire fund manager who invest in stock market on your behalf through mutual fund schemes. amcs are basically provider of mutual fund schemes.there are two types of load in mutual fund:exit loadentry loadexit load is nothing but penalty of leaving any fund before it’s maturity period.entry load was charge while entering the fund. there are three option one have to invest in mutual fund:sip (systematic investment plan)swp (systematic withdrawal plan)stp (systematic transfer plan)in sip, fixed amount debited from investors bank account periodically to buy units as per the nav. sip is good for small investors and one can stop sip anytime. it saves investor from volatile market.sip is good for only those who get monthly income. but if you have lumpsum amount than go for swp . swp is good for those who wants regular income.there are two investing method to invest in shares:value investinggrowth investingvalue investing’s main objective is to find undervalued shares to gain higher returns in future.while, growth investing’s main objective is to invest in companies which are expected to have high growth opportunity.american investor warren buffett is an value investor.there are two types of investing approach:top down approachbottom up approach.in top down approach one need to first analyze economy then industry and lastly company in which one wants to invest.while in bottom up approach investors first analyze company then industry and last but not least economy.mutual fund can be hold in two format:electronic formatphysical formatso, what is basically an demat account? demat account is an medium where your bought shares are stored. demat account can hold shares and bonds in electronic format.if you want to hold shares in physical format then you can use isa service. isa provide both physical and demat options. while dealing with liquid fund for daily transactions physical format holdings of mutual fund needed. at last the best way to hold mutual fund is electronic format.so far, i think you get your answer that mutual fund are ideal investment options. but there are some risk in mutual fund schemes which know one seems to be acknowledge. now question arises about how to measure risk in mutual fund schemes, that’s what we will discuss right now.mutual fund risk indicators :these indicators are rarely used and mostly important to get mathematical insights of mutual fund investment. so don’t worry if you don’t understand these risk indicators.risk measure:as name suggest it measure risk in an mutual fund investment by using past and available data. we will now discuss three types of risk measures in an mutual fund investment. the three types of risk measure are : standard deviation, beta and variance.1] standard deviation:standard deviation is measure of risk in an mutual fund investment. it is basically an measure to determine the extent of volatility in mutual fund. it is one way a measure of volatility.2] beta:beta is measure of risk in a fund based on authentic data collected from past returns of an particular investment. it’s not good for predicting long term risk as data of past returns is not enough to analyze the future returns.3] variance:variance is also a measure of risk in a fund just like beta and standard deviation. it is basically a measure to determine how similar does benchmark index and investment’s performance are. benchmark index is basically an index which is used to compare the investment performance. nifty and sensex are the example of indices.risk adjusted returns:it is a way to examine the performance of any investment by adjusting for it’s risk. these ratios are rarely used and mostly important to get mathematical insights of your investment. so don’t worry if you don’t understand these ratios. we will discuss four types of risk adjusted returns one by one. the four types of risk adjusted returns are: sharpe ratio, treynor ratio, alpha, information ratio and last but not least sortino ratio.1] sharpe ratio:sharpe ratio have notion that volatility is not good metric as risk equals volatility. because of this, sharpe ratio provide less return as it doesn’t recommend to invest in high volatile assets which generally provide more return then less volatile assets.2] treynor ratio:treynor ratio in one way is opposite of sharpe ratio which usually consider volatility ideal for investment. treynor ratio is basically the measurement of the returns generated in excess of that which could possibly earned on an investment with no diversifiable risk like fixed deposits or bonds.treynor didn’t consider unsystematic risk while sharpe ratio also consider unsystematic as well as systematic risk.systematic risk and total risk of some portfolio could be different but treynor consider both as similar.treynor is only good for evaluating the sub-portfolio of a fully diversified broader portfolio.3] jenson’s alpha:as per this, if assets is more risky then it should have high expected returns than less risky assets. the statement seems no–brainer. as we all know, more the risk you took more the returns one could expect.4] information ratio:information ratio is basically a measure of risk-adjusted returns of an portfolio like a mutual fund. it was traditionally used to check the fund manager’s investing skills.it basically measure the active returns of fund manager’s portfolio divided by the amount of risk the fund manager took as relative to benchmark returns. if ratios value is higher than it suggest that investor took more risk to achieve the investment returns. it’s good way to check whether fund manager beats benchmark returns or not.5] sortino ratio:sortino ratio is a ratio of average excess returns to the downside risk.so, if downside risk is high sortino ratio will decrease as they are inversely proportional.as per formula, increase in sortino ratio will result in higher mutual fund return. while calculating an investor has to set their target returns (t) as per their needs. this helps to maintain the returns above the fixed target.i hope you enjoy reading this detailed guide. if you have any doubt , please comment below, i will try my best to help you.disclaimer: investment in

8370,"to start off, i have the opportunity to transfer to columbia university through a 3+2 program. essentially, you study physics at your home university for three years, then transfer to earn a second bachelor's degree at columbia's fu foundation engineering school (i would be studying computer science).my concern here is that i will be in school for a cumulative total of six years. i spent my freshman year at a large state school and transferred to the school that i'm currently at after finding out about this program and also because i was not happy where i started out. many of my credits didn't transfer to my current major, thus i will have to spend an extra year in school, so it is what is. i'm having doubts about whether i should continue onward with this path because i guess i've just had a change of heart and also the realization that i will be in over $85k in student loan debt when i graduate is a bit terrifying lol. the alternative is i graduate from my current university with a fraction of the debt ($5k) and two years earlier. the opportunity cost of not starting my career two years earlier could be upwards of $100k of forgone income which is another component i've considered. the financial argument is strong as is, but my time is definitely the most valuable factor.don't get me wrong--columbia is a world-class institution and the resources and environment are incredible and i'm very lucky to have this opportunity. however, i would greatly appreciate it if anyone could shed some light on whether the ""prestige"" of a school like columbia is worth two extra years of time and roughly $80k in extra student loans.",54,1,Are two extra years of school for an Ivy League degree worth the cost?,Finance

(i think) this will near max it out, as well as lower our taxable income a considerable amount. this will bring us down about 1200 per month, so should still have 500+ surplus in cash every month.keep 25k in a high yield savings account for an emergency fund. we are almost done with a basement remodel. will cost about another 5k to finish.get rid of pmi:1. may 2021 will be five years since owning our house, and we would only have to pay about 5k towards principal to get under 80% loan to value.2. once the carpet is installed in two weeks, get a 500 dollar reappraisal. i'm 100% confident the reappraisal will be at least 467000, which will put us under 80% ltv. two houses sold in our neighborhood for 500k+ this year, so we could even hit 75% ltv if the appraisal is 497k+.3. correct me if i'm wrong, but everything i'm reading states it doesn't matter what the lender/contract says. once ltv and ownership hits the threshold, and you can request it be taken off, and they have to abide (dude).if all my math is right, we will have about 10-15k left over in cash.  what should i do with the extra 10-15k? roth ira? 529 for college? bumping emergency fund to 30k may not be a bad idea. we are trying for a second kid, tbd at the moment. keep in savings to have in 12-14 months for additional daycare costs?should i do anything with the old 401k or just let it sit? it's in a target date fund, and the return was 10.79% this year thus far.thanks in advance! i've already learned so much from this subreddit, and will be forever grateful for the knowledge and experiences shared to it.",8,1,Rebalancing 401k and Cash,Finance

9127,"i purchased a home a few months ago in houston with an fha loan. during the underwriting process i was worried that i would not get approved because of my student loans since the fha guidelines do not allow for income-based student loan repayment plans (ibr) to be used. i attended graduate school, so my student loans are quite high and fha wanted to use 1% of the balance and add it to my monthly debt-to-income ratio, which would not have allowed me to qualify for the house i wanted. a loan officer at my mortgage lending company said that if i could get an estimate letter from my student loan servicer stating what the monthly fully amortized payment would be on a standard extended plan (about 0.5% of the balance), i would qualify. so i did all of this, got approved, closed on the house, and moved in.i guess my file was reviewed by fha and now i’m being told by my loan officer that i need a letter of the actual monthly payment, not the estimated payment, or else they may call the note due. why is this a problem? because my student loan servicer can only provide a copy of the ibr repayment amount since that is the plan i am currently on, which fha does not allow for. i tried contacting my student loan servicer to officially switch over into the standard extended repayment plan and was told that i cannot do this yet since i only made 1 payment (i consolidated my loans earlier in the year) before the covid-19 pandemic hit and my loans were put into automatic forbearance.i’m so confused about how i was able to close on the house to begin with if there are issues and what happens moving forward. does anyone have any idea about what i should do or what happens next? my loan officer said they may have to roll me over into a new loan, but how is that possible and what if i don’t qualify for a conventional loan or some other issue?",6,1,FHA Insurance Denied after Closing on House?,Finance

9353,"i am currently in a situation where it may be beneficial to purposefully over contribute to my hsa for the 2020 tax year ($3,550 contribution limit for a single tax filer).  from my research, i believe this is an unusual situation and i'm not too clear on the best way to handle it.# the situation:before being laid off in march (due to the pandemic-induced downturn), i had already contributed to my hsa through my first employer, with a portion of that being a company match.  my new employer (as of may) also provides a company match up to $1,500 and a one-time funding amount of $1,000.  taking full advantage of the new employer's company match would put me over the 2020 irs contribution limit.# the question:is it worth taking advantage of the second employer's full company match by overfunding my hsa?# the numbers:|employer 1|my contribution|$800|contributed||:-|:-|:-|:-||employer 1|employer match contribution|$750|contributed||employer 2|employer 1-time contribution|$1,000|contributed||employer 2|my contribution|$1,500|**not yet** contributed||employer 2|employer match contribution|$1,500|**not yet** contributed||**2020 totals:**||**$2,550**|contribution to date||||**$5,550**|potential to contribute|again, the 2020 irs hsa contribution limit is $3,550.  so taking full advantage of the employer match would require a $2,000 overcontribution.# the implications:from my research, these are the following penalties for overcontribution.  please correct me if i have misinterpreted any of these conclusions.* a 6% excise tax is applied to the overcontribution amount (and associated earnings - not sure how that would be calculated if only a portion of the hsa is tied up in investment funds)* *not sure about this point*: in addition to the excise tax, the overcontribution amount would also be taxed as ordinary income. *can somebody confirm/deny this?** any excess amount would then apply to the next year's contribution amount (2021 - $3,600 limit).   * and if i took advantage of the full company match next year in 2021...      * (**$2,000** *2020 excess* \+ **$3,000** *2021 personal and employer match contribution* = **$5,000** *total 2021 contribution* \--&gt; a **$1,400** overcontribution for 2021, which would then incur another 6% excise tax, *and may also be taxed as ordinary income...? maybe?*)* excess contribution can be removed by april 15, 2021 (for the 2020 tax year) to avoid the 6% excise tax, and would be taxed as ordinary income.# i see a few paths here:* fund the last $1,000 of my 2020 allowable contribution (half self, half employer match).   * i'll lose out on $1,000 of the $1,500 employer match.* fund an additional $3,000 (to take advantage of the full $1,500 employer match), resulting in a $2,000 overcontribution.   * overfund option 1: as outlined earlier; leave the 2020 overcontribution amount ($2,000) in my hsa account, incur the 6% excise tax in 2020, then fund only the $3,000 for the company match in 2021 for a 2021 over contribution amount of $1,400, incur the 6% excise tax in 2021, and so forth until there's no more excess rolling into the next year.  *(the big kicker here is that that excess may also be taxed as ordinary income in each year; still the part i'm unclear on)*   * overfund option 2: remove excess contributions by the april 15, 2021 tax filing deadline.  those would then be taxed as ordinary income.      * i could do this by asking my employer to correct the contribution amount so it is shown as taxable income instead of hsa contribution on your w2 *(but they would likely take back the employer-funded contribution)*      * i could also do this by asking the financial institution who holds my hsa for an ""excess contribution removal."" but the contribution amounts on my w2s from the employer would still add up to the $5,550 for 2020.  (when filing taxes, there's somewhere to account for that discrepancy, right?)  *in pursuing this path, i'm not sure if there would be any communication between the financial institution and my employer in the background that would result in the employer taking back the matched funding - which would also be against the point.*# back to the original question:* is it worth taking advantage of the second employer's full company match by overfunding my hsa?* if it is, then what's the best way to handle that?",7,1,Purposeful HSA Over-Contribution?,Finance
9357,"hi,i find this group to be close enough with what i think is a good judgement source, so i am seeking for an advice from y'all.so i'm in my mid thirties, married, become a dad recetly, and working full time for a great tech company that treats peiple really nice, but the job itself is borring af.it's worth mentioning that i live in western europe, where cost of living is quite high, and having a car is not as mandatory due to good public transport, but still, having a car makes a huge impact on the quality of your life.i currently drive an old mazda 6 from 2003, that i've purchased last year as a ""temporary solution"" for 2200€. turned out to be a great car, so i ended up owning it 18 months later ( today ) and it still rides smoothly.now, the problem. i am a big honda lover, and quite often i dadream about driving an accord, but they are quite rare here, and pretty expensive as well. also, for the first time in my life, i have built some savings, and i can finally have some piece of mind. up until 3 years ago, we couldn't even save up to 1000€, and now we managed to save 55k, in less than 3 years! big part of this is thanks to the equity program that my company awarded me when i signed the contract ( around 60% of it had vested so far ).so my estimate is that i should be able to reach 150k in the next 2 years, with other bonuses and by saving from every paycheck about 25%. after that, my ability to save money will rapidly decrease, but we should be able to cover the usual living cost at least, but not more than that. i see this wave i am riding as an opportunity to build financial independence in the next 10-15 years, or less if i'm lucky.in one scenario, if i reach 300k and have them invested wosely into some good etfs or dividend stocks, i might be able to retire quite comfortably in the balkan where i was born and raised. for my current place of living, that number would have to be at least 2.5 times higher, but i value freedom a lot, so would probably compromise on some things so that i can retire 10 years earlier than in eu.i miss the sun here too much, so i'll move back eventually anyways ( probably when kid finishes high school in 17 years, i'll be 50 by then, which is cool ).back to the honda dillema.pros:- it's 8 year newer, a facelift model with 113.000km only- great condition, loads of dopamine while driving- much better safety, familiy secured better- will be able to drive it for 5-6 years without having to worry about maintenance ( they are very reliable )- i can afford it mathematically. it would cost me mazda ( trade in ) and 11.000€ on topcons:it would slow dowh the compounding process ( assuming it's mostly positive over time ) and could eventually delay my beloved freedom from having to work 9-5 for yearsso bottom line is, i firmly believe that we should enjoy the fruits of our labor, and buy things that bring joy and practicality in your life, but i also have internal voices that are suggesting that i shouldn't sacrifice long term financial well being for the instant gratification and cheap thrill that won't last for long, and will then turn into a liability.is the ""look rich or be rich"" relevant in this case?when i was searching online, one rule of thumb was to use 10% of your annual pre-tax salary for a car purchase. in my case it's 15%.the other rule is to pay 20% dividend, and then spend up to 10% of your take home paycheck for loan payment and other expenses. in my case it would be around 10-12%.lastly, i have all my savings currently invested in msft, sq, cost and barrick, so buying this car would mean selling a portion of stocks, which i am very reluctant to do, and buy the car from that money.that was a long post, thanks for reading the whole thought process. i am looking forward to hearing your opinions about the decision process, and what i should be taking into account.cheers,",11,1,"To Honda, or not to Honda?",Finance

9926,"hey all,first of all i want to say from browsing pf i've learned a ton. i want to thank all of the users and the super helpful info from the sidebar for helping me get to a good financial spot. i have a few questions on what else to do in my next steps that i would love some advice on. quick background: i use to make shit money up until i was around 28 (i am now in my early 30s). slowly building back my ruined credit and starting to finally save for retirement. i make **75k** flat, not including bonuses. my wife makes around **45k**. i have no debt to my name and one paid off car. this past year my wife and i decided that my salary will be used for bills, most expenses and saving for a down payment for a house. her salary is used to aggressively pay off all her debt. we knocked out her **10k** credit card debt this year doing it this way and next up we are tackling her medical debt (**5k**). after that is tackled we will approach her student loan debt (**50k**). my current financial standing is: - 10k emergency fund- 2k wife emergency fund- 22k trad ira - 5k in current employer 401k- and here is the dumb part which i desperately need help: 15k in checking- i'm able to save about 1k per monthi just opened up a roth ira and am going to beef up my contribution to that in the new year as well and leave the trad ira to just grow. i did more research and it looks like it makes more sense for me to focus on the roth instead since i anticipate my salary will continue to grow. i am expecting about **10k** in rsus (after the ridiculous taxes on them) that will be available to me in march. i will be selling this immediately.my questions are: 1. where should i keep my money for the downpayment for a house? i feel really really dumb just keeping 15k sitting there, with the extra 10k coming in march i don't want to keep doing this and need to break from this weird mental block i put myself in. especially with it just getting eaten into by inflation every year. i just don't know what to do with it and i'm nervous on where to stash it.2. for my roth ira should i just match the same investments as my trad? right now my trad is a mix between fskak, ftihx, and fxnax. i want to open up my portfolio a bit more as i'm really interested in renewable energy and other things. risk tolerance is about in the middle.3. after maxing my roth, paying all bills and saving for the month how much is reasonable to allocate in ""play investment money"". i want to have a small pool of putting funds directly into the market (not just bbut i don't want to be crazy with it. 4. my last job what i did when i left was dump my 401k all into a trad because i wanted more options to invest it but not eat the tax for roth. still not sure if this was incredibly stupid or not. should i continue to do this when i switch jobs again or just leave it?thanks again all, words can't really describe how much this message board has been so helpful on getting my financial life into gear. just wish i started 10 years earlier!",8,2,A few questions on money from someone who isn't smart,Finance

10155," hello!tldr: i wanna transfer my savings to a roth ira while my financially savvy dad insists that i should stick with the traditional ira. who's right?i (20f) am studying cs in school and have completed an internship at a faang company this past summer. i used a lot of my earnings to pay for school, and ended up saving about $1,500 in the 401k account the company provides thinking that i could take advantage of company matching. i came to realize the matching doesn't apply to interns, and that i didn't save enough for the company to keep the account open, so they rolled over that amount into a traditional ira after my internship was complete.i have been thinking that i should take the money out of the traditional ira, pay taxes on it, and put it in a roth, hoping to only contribute to this roth during my junior and senior year as well, and switch to a traditional ira once i'm out in the industry. my reasoning behind this is that i am in a far lower tax bracket now than i will be after graduation, and likely at retirement (though i don't know when that will be). i made roughly $22k this summer, gross, and expect to be pulling at least 6-figures post graduation at one of these faangs. thus, it makes sense for me to want to pay taxes upfront because i will have to pay fewer taxes now percentage-wise than at any other point in my life.when i told my dad, who taught me a lot of stuff about finances in the first place, he rolled his eyes and told me i was overthinking it. his main argument was that you should always opt to pay taxes later as opposed to now because i don't know anything about what options will be available to me in the future. mainly, he was speaking to the fact that the tax code could be different, or that my assumption that i'll be in a high tax bracket at retirement may not be so valid at that point if i'm living off of capital gains, for instance. i dunno about this, i kind of love working, so i can't imagine not having some income at the time of retirement, though this is 20 year old me speaking on the topic.after i thought about it further, i also realized that the taxes will decrease my principal, and the whole point of saving for retirement early on is to take advantage of the power of compound interest. so, now i'm left wondering if the decreased principle now will counteract the effects of increased taxes later. whatever my decision will be, i'll probably contribute roughly the same $1,500-2,000 to that account for the next couple summers when i'm in school.i know that the sum of money really isn't that significant, i'm treating this decision as more of an intellectual exercise and an opportunity to learn more about tax policy. i'd love to hear your take on this debate because i've been a silent lurker on here for years since my parents instilled in me that money gives you the freedom of choice, something that has always been appealing to me.",22,1,help settle dispute: roth vs traditional ira in niche case,Finance

10184,"hey! i'm a 24 male nurse who did some bad choices earlier in life. also my parents kinda used me with stuff like ""take out a loan and we will split in half after, it would help us a lot right now"". well it did. they run a successful chain of pubs now and i'm in debt. but i've got everything going good now. i did the math and i could be debt free in year and a half. with that last half basically being just a small amount of cc debt i'd already have much more money to use as i want. now i also need to pay for driving license which i don't have yet. it's getting more expensive every year over here. this is in europe and i earn around 1000€ a month. this definitely isn't much in us but over here it's above average. for example i pay 80€ + utilities for my apartment. driver's license costs around 600€ + some extra fees which comes to around 650€. i can easily set aside 100-150€ each month and still live comfortably. so after i pay for drivers license my original plan was to keep setting the money aside for a car. but now i've been thinking. i didn't really miss a car these last few years since i live in a city. and there's a regular train going to where parents live. i really want a car because it makes everything easier and i love going on fishing trips. but setting aside 100-150€ (i do work overtimes a lot so this may even be 300€  or more a month but i'm counting with an average smaller paycheck during last year) every month would mean that i'd be debt free much sooner. and when i'm debt free i will be able to set aside 500-700€ each month since i don't have any other big expenses. with used cars in good condition here going around 2000€ i can get a car super fast. so what would you focus on? i'm afraid that the price for license will go up again. also this may be stupid but i'm not sure if when i decide to put everything towards debt my new girlfriend would understand it. but that's not the priority now haha. i'm overall happy with how my life is going now. i just need to keep at it for a year and i'm gonna be 25, debt free and finally not stupid with my money. i learned my lessons the hard way haha.so bottom line, what would you focus on? what's the smartest way to handle this?",6,1,Focus on debt in 2021 or pay for driving license/save up for a car?,Finance

10670,"like many, this year has really shifted my finances in a negative direction. i am married, and my husband and i make $90k/year together before tax (nc). our emotional mindset around our finances i believe is very healthy at this point, i’m 26, he’s 30, we’ve done a lot of growing up since we originated all the debt we have and we’ve become very frugal people, especially after this year. we both suffered job losses but are finally both in stable positions now. we sold our home last year and moved states and have basically nothing in the way of assets. neither of us have a 401k, or any investments. we have a lot of debt. part of our debt is about $29,000. $11,000 of which is just one credit card that was mostly used on emergency spending except for about $1500 that was used for moving expenses, another $7,000 in student loans, and the rest are compiled of other credit cards and medical bills. then, i have a debt consolidation loan i’ve been paying on for almost 2 years that started at $12k but i have down to $9k now, it has a 14% interest rate and is through my credit union. we also each have a $420 car payment. so right now, in an apartment that costs us $920 a month which is about the cheapest we could find in this area, our monthly income is about $4,910, and we have about $3,220 going out for bills and debts, and usually about $1000 between gas, groceries, dog food (for our one dog) and miscellaneous expenses like household items, toiletries, basic haircuts, and basic car maintenance. our expendable income behind that is very small, but i feel like we never even see it. i don’t know where it’s going but when i say we never go anywhere or do anything i really mean it. i feel like there’s about $500-$600 lost in the dryer like a lonely sock every month and i don’t know how to get a handle on that. i have been considering another debt consolidation loan or something. we need to find a new local bank or credit union and would probably try to get it through them, but i don’t know if this is the right choice. unfortunately, it took us a long time to get to a general idea of healthy finances, we just didn’t learn any of this from our parents. we also used to make a lot more money before we moved and before covid, so our outgoing monthly expenses weren’t as painful. our ideal goal has been to buy another house and start our family by the middle-end of 2021. my husband is looking for higher paying jobs, he was in it but lost his job due to covid and had to go back to retail management suffering a $30k/year loss of wages. my income of about $45k will likely stay the same for the foreseeable future. we’ve been putting off starting a family for financial reasons for a couple of years and it’s very important to us. we want to plan on my being able to stay home with a baby and live off of his income (given he gets back to it and is paid what he was before) but at this point i don’t know how we could possibly achieve this, i really just need some guidance and sincerely appreciate anyone taking the time to read this and offer any.",40,1,Should I get another debt consolidation loan?

post mr. money mustache's shockingly simple math behind early retirement. and somehow it didn't seem like an impossible goal, it actually seemed quite obtainable. initially i aimed at building a portfolio that could support me going down to work 50% by the time i have kids so that i can be there for them when they need it the most, but as the year went on i realised i was making good progress so i raised my ambitions and am now looking for a total early retirement instead. the goal is to retire sometime around 2033-2035 when i'm in my early forties.i've worked part time during most of my adulthood to enable me to train and compete in sports on a high level. but an injury forced me to ""retire early"" in another sense from the sport. so since last year i now have a full time employmenti have a side hustle in photography where i recently am starting to make some extra money as well and have opened a business for. at the end of 2020 i also expanded a bit and now have a regular assignment in the same field where i will be working part time (50%) . my business's economy is separated from my ""personal finances"". i can buy electronics and trips through my business and i won't count any of my business income in these numbers unless i've specifically moved them from my business account to my private account.**quartely breakdown****q1 -** got a large cash infusion from a big side hustle project in december which was nice. i remember mentioning in a comment last year that i didn't feel like i needed more than $1000-2000 because the most financially impacting expense for me would be that i would move houses, and i didn't see that happening anytime soon. well not short after i moved. and then i moved again six months later. so it was a good thing i had some extra cash coming in. sr at 54% for the quarter.**q2** \- more or less a normal quarter, bussiness as usual that let me log a nice sr of 58% for the quarter. due to some financial rules following me getting employed full time i did not get my vacation bonus lump sum i got last year. i will however get both that and pto in 2021.**q3** \- moved again. managed to keep the cost down pretty well and bought most furniture second hand and from ikea (go sweden). also went on a (covid safe) vacation in sweden for the summer month. it was actually the first time in my life that i had a paid vacation since last year was the first time i started working full time. very nice. solid income this quarter too but sr got dragged down from moving costs and landed at 46%**q4** \- another normal quarter expense wise. the rent at the new place is about 60% higher due to it being in an even better location and also being bigger. this this quarter i started a new type of job in my side hustle that will be a regular occurance for the forseeable future. it will allow me to add about $1k to my long term savings each month. very nice. savings rate ended up at 67% for the quarter and 56% for the year.**a look at the expenses***rent* \- looking at expenses, rent and utilities is hands down the biggest contributor. i now live with my girlfriend in a 2 room and kitchen apartment at about 50m2. the rent is higher than i would like it to be but the location and apartment is great. i live in central stockholm.*food* \- other than rent, food was the biggest post. i'm doing my best to make as much food as possible at home and only buy out when i really want to. another prominent swede in the fire community came up with the saying that restaurants don't sell food, they sell an experience. this is a good way to think about buying out and not taking it for granted. food cost this year was down a little bit compared to last year, yay!*travel* \- travel cost were not too bad this year. only did the covid safe sweden vacation for two weeks which wasn't too expensive.*phone* \- last year i made the final payments on my phone in q3 and i still have a relatively cheap plan for unlimited data. i put in a new battery and will still aim to keep this phone (iphone 8+) until it dies.*entertainment -* i spent less here than last year. i tried golfing a few times (pretty expensive) and bought some video games. i also put haircuts in this category even though it probably shouldn't be. i don't spend much in this category. if i need to upgrade my computer or other hardware most of the cases i can pay for it through my business/side hustle and have it as a business expense.*clothing -* this year i set a goal for myself that i would not buy any clothes. i managed to complete this goal, yay!*gym membership -* last year i said, ""this one is a bit on the high end so i need to really evaluate it this year and make sure i go there enough to warrant keeping the expense."" this year was a bit weird so i didn't visit as much as i'd have liked. was able to freeze the membership for end of this year and beginning of the next. we will see when i can establish a normal baseline here again. it was an easier cost to motivate when i was training at an elite level.*health care* \- bought some allergy meds and started seeing a physical therapist to take care of the issue that caused me to retire from sports.*uif -* this is a cheap insurance to make sure i still get 80% of my current income should i lose my job for whatever reason. the cost of this was raised this summer following covid. i might see if i can find another uif at a better price now.*subscriptions -* my spotify account.*transport -* until the beginning of summer i was commuting with busses and trains but for the rest of the year i've been riding my scooter everywhere. thanks to mild temperatures i could ride it throughout december. i had to spend some money getting spare parts to fix up some issues with the moped.*buffer/short term savings -* i dropped this to be at $1000 and have been able to keep it there. i don't know what could possibly happen that would require me to have to deplete all of that amount of money now that i've moved twice and have furniture coming out my ass. in 2021 i will also expand this sort of, by saving for trips and other fun stuff. so there will be a sort of

11813,"hi all. i want to preface this whole thing by saying that i am not sure i can work right now because of the pandemic. i caught covid and had it severely, almost died. severe pneumonia. lost half of my hair, so i am just petrified to catch it again or a new strain. this makes everything harder. i hope you're all doing well, and i hope you don't mind if i vent and ask for some emotional support. i am pretty much living at poverty level income. i'm not living in poverty at all. i have a nice place to live from smart searching and negotiating, and i have budgeted the money i have to last me until at least my lease is up next year for bare minimum creature comforts: utilities, wifi, food, etc. i hit ""low income"" between savings + minor income that is coming in through my parent at this time. we are living together to survive this pandemic and were both in bad financial situations prior to the pandemic so yeah, survival. i am feeling low and panicked, and i don't want to make bad decisions because i'm having a hard time reaching for logic right now. short and sweet: i come from a, what i can now see as, very unsupportive family, in every which way. it's not an excuse, but maybe it's sort of an excuse. i have never been taught how to be financially healthy, or even healthfully heathy. i come from one of those families that is fat but talks about how you should look like a model, in every facet of life, even money. be rich, but there's no teachings on how to be rich. i'm trying to think of any helpful lifeskill i've ever been taught, and when it comes down to it, maybe none. i know i need to move on from this and just move forward, but it's hard to not point fingers and blame when you're in a hole and you're not sure how you got there. i am 31, so i know it's my problem to sort now, no matter what.i am having to reteach myself a lot, and only because i learned the **hard way** how terrible life is when you're not actually implementing the steps it takes to get to your goals. the hard way was getting extremely ill with an autoimmune disease. i lost everything. literally pretty much everything that made up my very comfortable, ignorance is bliss previous life.  then i got sick. sick without being able to be diagnosed for five years, which led to me being disabled, which led to be not being able to work and at the mercy of a very financially illiterate parent. i almost became homeless because of this. i'd grown up in middle class in my grandparent's home. was even so lucky as to have been gifted an inheritance by grandparents i never got to meet (around $100k), that i completely squandered away (mostly on college tuition, but still, i never would have paid in cash like i did if i knew better!!) because of extreme ignorance and zero help or direction. like i wish someone would have tied me down, slapped me in the face, and said: do this, not this, dumbass. and then because of getting sick i fell into poverty, with zero help and only judgement from my family, who i pretty much cut ties with. while i was sick, i vowed to learn about money and investing. it happened when i heard my grandparent whispering amongst my uncle and aunt about a stock they had all gone in on and did really well, and i was totally left out of the equation. i heard that an uncle had put in $1k for his kid and it split, so he was just making his kid give him the $1k--and these were people who already had a lot of money. i'm listening to this on a cot, sick as a dog on the living room floor of my grandparent's, where i lived so i wouldn't live in the street. it was the absolute lowest low of my entire life. so was my parent. it was just the breaking point for me. hearing them gush about the stock made everything clear, why she was the way she was, why i am the way i am--ignorant by design, and i let my rage turn into learning. i don't want to toot my own horn, but toot toot, beep beep. i spent two years while i was so sick i could barely function just learning everything i could about investing and budgeting, from youtube! it's why i even have the emergency fund i do now, and why i have some investments in the market. but i feel like everything may come crashing down and i don't want to make any stupid moves. i renegotiated my rent so i can stay here through next year and the pandemic's hopeful end (god please!!). i have enough between my parent's social security money + the savings i have to forcefully conjure to keep us living here comfortably for another year. i had to renegotiate my rent at a bit of a higher price. of course, the landlords are taking advantage of everything somehow going up in price while people are suffering, but it was about $1k difference and i didn't think it would be worth having to look for a new place. now i am also running into dental issues and think i'll need to use at least $2k to make sure i can keep my teeth longterm. now i'm eating into my own emergency fund, and i know it's an emergency fund, but it's the only cash i have left of my inheritance, about $10k. i don't even know what i'm asking for. i do not want to end up in poverty. i'm a somewhat intelligent person. i have a college degree. i went through hard times and it has thrown me into a dimension where everything is hard. i have to fight against a parent that acts like a child when it comes to budgeting and spending. i am 31 and i want a life. i want a career and to be married someday, but sometimes i feel like i'm raising my mother, and that i am so, so behind and it's so hard to see that this will all be a memory someday and i will have the life i want. can someone please tell me this isn't that bad and there's a way out? i don't know what i'm looking for!

12545,"hello. first post in this sub. i'll start with some details about me and my situation. i'm living in bucharest, romania right now with my girlfriend (soon to be wife).about me:* 24 years old* php developer, going fast to 5 years of experience in the field, got my first job at 19 as a dev* earning a monthly income of 6280 ron (that roughly translates to 1300 euros)* in february 2021 i'll get a raise to 7780 ron (\~1600 euros) and in september 2021 i have another raised pre-signed that will get me to 8280 ron (\~1700 euros)* no credits for apartments/houses* no credit cards (well i have 1 that i can buy anything with 0% interest if i buy from certain stores and set it up for 3,6,12,24 or 40 months. it has 750 euros on it. annual taxes are \~10 euros. no monthly tax)* 1 personal needs loan (used to help me buy a car 1.5 years ago): 5 years, 33 000 ron (\~7000 euros at that time), 24 000 ron (\~5000 euros) left to pay. the entire loan has an annual percentage rate of charge of 8% if i'm not mistaken. the monthly pay is 662.53 ron (\~137 euros)* now regarding that car. it's a skoda octavia 2015, 1.6tdi 110hp greenline edition (manual gearbox). no major problems, paid 9k for it and an extra 1k to fix stuff. bought with 179 000km, got her right now to abut 190 000 in 1.5 years. i have some problems with it right now but nothing important, all the fixes cost around 350 euros.about my girlfriend:* 24 years old* entry level pharmacist, barely 3 months of experience in the field* earning around \~650 euros per month, salary might increase this year after a renegotiation and should go to around \~800 euros (i know, small income but it's at the beginning of her career, i'd say it's a pretty good start)* no credits for apartments/houses* no credit cards (if she needs one she'll use mine, i talked about it)* no personal needs loans* nothing more to said here, she's starting her new life in bucharest with me and it's at the very beginning with everything.details about us/our situation:* living in bucharest, as i said, paying a monthly rent of 375 euros that can be paid in ron at the bnr's (romanian national bank i guess it's called) course of the payment day (5th of every month). right now that would be 1822 ron. the apartment is a 2-bedroom one with private heating (not sure if this is the best english expression, heh) and an air-conditioning. felt like saying those 2 things since they can increase the overall expenses in any house.* i'm splitting the rent 50-50 with my girlfriend so that's 911 ron (\~190 euros each\[rounded it up\])* apartments' utilities are like maximum 250 ron (\~50 euros) in the winter and about half on summer days* internet + tv is 15 euros per month* netflix is \~4 euros per month (got it with some friends)* i have a google drive subscription of \~3 euros per month* my phone subscription is 8 euros per month (no need to change it, it gives me all i need and even more)* my girlfriends' subscription is pretty much the same, somewhere around 7 euros, no need to changed it there either. * our combine monthly income is somewhere around 9280 ron (\~1900 euros)that's pretty much all the details i can offer to provide some context. now. let's get into the things that i want to really talk about it. i can't say my income is low/small and things like that. i mean i know people around me that live with \~400 euros per month. as another info for context, the average income in romania is around 690 euros. well. even though i have a pretty much nice income... i can't shake the feeling that i'm actually kind of poor and don't know how to manage my finances. i have no savings right now, can't even think to pay a down payment for a credit to an apartment because that means i need to have \~9000 euros in my account. got like 200 right now.i hate my situation and how i'm doing stuff. i feel like i could've been much better with my money and could've got a better ""net worth"" if that's what it's called. i need to make some changes and that's why i'm here. i need some baby-steps. as i write this i'm getting the feeling that i'll receive a certain question: ""what are your expenses besides those regarding your rent/utilities)?""another problem coming in. i seem to spend money on soccer betting and video games. i hate this. in december i spent somewhere around 250-300 euros combined on those 2. i can't say i'm an addict cause it's not monthly but whenever i see that my savings are going up... i start to spend like an idiot because you only have one life and things like that. i know that i found the problem and that i need to get rid of those 2 useless habits but that is an internal work in progress. blocked all my betting accounts and remove my card from that video game (world of tanks). another problem. i don't know how to use my money wisely. how do i manage to get into a mindset that lets me save money? i tried economies accounts (i hope that's what it's called, that account where you send money anytime and you get a monthly interest but you have no restriction on when to get the money out or anything. it's just a simple account that gives you interest). anyway, that account is not exactly great, the interest rate is way way way under the inflation and that's annoying. i also tried the stock market. sent in the market 200 euros, got them to a profit of 500 euros and thought to myself ""hell yeah, soon i'll be a millionaire"", the stock crashed 3 days later and got all the money out with a loss of 50 euros. never touched it again.i also tried index funds. don't exactly know why they didn't worked. i also tried deposits that are fixed for a period of time but it's annoying to lock money in an account for 3+ months. what if an emergency comes up and i need that money? i tried the bag cash in my closet to just keep money there but long term it's not okay. inflation gets me to actually lose money there. i tried everything but i always got to the point where i said ""ah, fuck it, that's  never going to be an option"" and then moved on to spend my economies and get myself into this situation (not a bad situation, i'm not complaining but i know i could've done better for the past 2 years since i doubled my income)another problem coming in. i'm not satisfied with my choice of the car i bought and the entire loan behind it. i bought the car 1.5 years ago and 0.5 years ago i came to the conclusion that i really don't need a \~10k car with a loan behind it. i could've done everything with my old car that had no loan. i found myself with double income and made the common mistake of ""hell yeah, i have money, let's buy a car, don't care anything else"".about this... i'm thinking of something here. i have 24 000 ron (\~5000 euros) left to pay of this car... if i concentrate \~2000 ron each month... i could pay the loan until december 2021 so this year. that would get me to a debt-free 2022 where i can only gain net worth with money in my accounts....or... i could just sell the car, pay off my loan and still leave me with 3000 euros but i'm the kind of guy who needs a car for his travels, groceries etc. i could use those 3000 to buy a car that fits my needs but i'm not sure it's a wise choice because downgrading from a 2015 octavia to a 2008-2010 3k car could lead to extra expenses because the car is well... old. i'm thinking here that the best choice is to fully commit this year to paying of this stupid car and live up with my choices....or... i could just sell the car, pay of 14 000 ron of my 24 000 ron loan and buy a car that would fit my needs with about 5000 euros. that would also mean a downgrade of car's year and comfort but i'll be with a 10 000 ron loan that could be paid much faster and with a cheaper car that could be actually okay with what i need from a car. not exactly sure what would be the best bet here. another thing for my future plans... i really want to get out of renting lifestyle. i want to buy an apartment here in bucharest as soon as i can. i'm thinking of going in for a 60-65 000 euros loan for a 2-bedroom apartment that would lead me to a monthly ""rent"" (to the bank but theoretically to myself) of \~300 eur for a 30 years plan and a down payment of 9900 euros.    so... i think i got into all i can say about my life and financial ""stuff"". i have multiple problems, none that are ""life threatening"", so i want to ""fix"" them. any advice on... anything? could use some advice on anything that you can think of, not only on the things i wrote here.ssorry for the long post but i really want to change my life in 2021 and i had to explain everything as best as i could. have a nice day and can't wait for your replies!",0,1,Advice regarding further financial decisions,Finance

13083,"hello,in 2014 i joined a fraternity while a freshman in college. i was a ""pledged member"" for a semester, paid the one time fee of $270 in pledge dues, but then at the end of the semester i wasn't initiated. the next semester i still attended some of the fraternity events, but since i was never initiated i wasn't an official member. i ended up dropping out of school that year as well. well, turns out they charged me not just for that second semester, but a full four years of membership dues. to be clear, i wasn't even attending school for three of those years. i wasn't aware of this, because the mailing address they had was incorrect. it had a typo so i never once received a bill from this organization. they just kept charging me more and more despite me never being in communication with any of the organization members, never attending the events, and i never received any of the benefits of the organization because i wasn't initiated. all in all, i owed about $1200 as a principle balance but $2150 after late fees (which also pissed me off, how can you charge almost $1000 in late fees?). the reason i discovered this debt is because it appeared on my credit report as a collection account. i never authorized any of those payments aside from the first semester which i paid, i never signed anything that i know of, they didn't even have my ssn#. they just had my name, my mom's name, an incorrect mailing address, and an outdated email address. the payments were most likely being authorized by a fraternity member who has long since graduated, too.how do i even begin to resolve this? if i consider the second semester to be fair game, at max i owe $300, maybe $500 if we're being generous and count late fees and collection fees. i doubt the collection agency will settle a $2150 debt for anywhere close to $300 let alone take it off my credit report. it's not the collection agency's fault anyway. i tried disputing it on my credit report as fraudulent earlier this year but it didn't work, granted i didn't really have any evidence to provide at the time. i still don't really know what would consistute ""evidence"" that i don't owe this debt.where do i start? i think my first plan is to call the collection agency and ask them to recall the debt back to the organization so i can take up this dispute with the fraternity directly. but i doubt the collection agency would be willing to recall the debt.",6,1,"Organization charged me membership fees without my knowledge, then sent me to collections.",Finance

14319,"family of 4 and i've been struggling trying to recover my credit due to long term financial mistakes on my part. month after month my debt was increasing significantly. as of earlier this summer i owed $95k in debt. this was multiple credit cards. it seems like an obscene amount and as i dug into it over the years it was from many different things. having two kids without a lot of savings, and 2020 covid struggles didn't help as some things hit those cards. medical issues over the past few years, even with benefits, were a large chunk of the expenses. the real killer that kind of caught me unaware was the significant interest being paid. years of making minimum payments made me sink further into debt and i would get slammed with $800 interest fees on one card alone every month.i won't go into too much detail here because i changed a lot of things thanks to some feedback on this subreddit. i did the following:* reviewed all weekly / monthly / annual subscriptions. things like netflix and other entertainment, spotify, etc. i cancelled everything. even if i thought maybe i really needed something i could at least go without it for a little while.* reviewed my electric, gas, and internet bills. tried to figure out what i could do to reduce all of them and limit expenses. reduced my internet bill as low as i could.* contacted home insurance and car insurance to renegotiate. home insurance was already good but car insurance i ended up saving $1,000 per year.* sold both cars and bought one used and leased a low mileage under a good deal. believe it or not this ended up being a significant savings.  leasing is not a wise decision but there were too many costs with my last car. this is now saving me $500 per month.* created a food plan for the week and reduced eating out. easier to do with the pandemic but at the most i will grab a coffee at dunkin on rare occasion now.* sold a lot of things on ebay to which turned into a good hobby to reduce clutter and earn some extra cash.* started using upwork as a second job finding gigs to earn some extra cash.nothing i did was a significant savings up front but over the past few months it was a huge help. i'm down to $58k in debt now which i think is still a crazy amount but at least it is going in the right direction. i make an excellent salary at the moment and want to do whatever i can to get my debt to zero so that i can start saving like a normal responsible person. i have an upcoming bonus that should be around $12k after tax that i intend to put 100% towards debt. we have zero vacation plans this year and again the pandemic helps with this so i am using that as an excuse to keep things cheap this year.my credit score has jumped up about 45 points now and what i am looking for advice on is if this is a good time to look into tapping into my home equity. i currently owe $200k on my house and it is valued at $340k. i didn't want to do anything with it until my spending was under control and using meal planning, and budgeting  (i use [mint.com](https://mint.com)). also, i have done some balance transfers to reduce interest rate on cards and have stuck to one credit card that i put charges on and pay off to $0 each month as a spending card. now it is appealing to tap into my house equity and pay off the remaining debt after my bonus is used on some of that debt.  is that a wise move at this point? any feedback is appreciated.",9,1,Time to tap into home equity?,Finance

15505,"so i am 23 years old. i am going into my last year of school starting this spring, for my finance degree. the only other job i have worked is a remote telemarketing job, that pays 10 an hour with some small commissions for each sale. i have been searching through indeed applying for countless other remote jobs, to see if i can find something better/more interesting.  well i currently have just been offered a job, after a couple phone interviews with 2 business partners in the real estate wholesale business. the job i would be working is commission only. i would be calling people from my home, and asking them if they want to sell their home. if they say yes, i would be peeling back the onion a bit more, asking them about the condition and things like that. after i get enough information from them, i would then transfer the to a higher up, to set an appointment to go look at the property.  so basically my job is to set as many appointments as i can, so that i can increase my chances on the company buying the house from them. the company would then sell the property for a gain, and then 14-30 days after the company sells the property, is when i would get my commission for it. the man had told me that the average money i would receive from commission would be around $1,000 a house, sometimes more so of like $2,000 if it is a big property.  basically, i would not be receiving any money for the first month most likely, because he says i need to build a ""pipeline"" which i guess makes sense. he had told me that this is not the job for someone who cannot handle rejection and make a lot of calls per day. this is also a 1099 job, but he wants me to set up a schedule where i can put in at least 20 hours per week.   i had also asked him how many others were working my position, and he told me i would be the 3rd person, as they recently hired the first two very recently. he had told me that only 1 person was making the calls pre-covid, and that he was very motivated and calling tons of ppl per week, but then covid happened and they shut down the wholesale side of the business for a few months. they are just recently getting back to starting up their wholesale side again, hence why i found their application on indeed.  thing is, is that i actually have a phone interview this friday, for an inside sales job that pays $11.80 an hour, its not a 1099 so id be an ""employee"". do i tell him that i need more time, and that ill get back to him at the end of the week?&amp;#x200b;is this something worth risking? does it sound like it could be a good opportunity? i like to think it is possibly a good opportunity, but it comes with the risk of not getting paid and then me eventually quitting and wasting weeks/ a month or so of my time. then again, i am a college student living at home, where my father makes me pay pretty much nothing to live here, besides my phone bill. so realistically i have time to be wasted (not that i want to, but its not like i'm struggling to pay bills living alone). it seems like i could potentially make a good amount more at this job than the $11,80 an hour one, but i also could potentially make way less or nothing, and waste my time. the guy had told me that if i put in at least 20 hours a week and i am doing a decent job, that i could make around $40k a year doing something like this, but is that just him sugarcoating it? i have no idea.   i had also asked him if ppl were really willing to sell their homes during this pandemic, and he said that it seems like ppl are just as willing to sell, and that he plans on 2021 being a big year for ppl to sell their homes. i do not have a lot of knowledge about real estate, but it has been something  that i have been interested in, even before this job came along.",13,1,Commission only job.

16285,"to start,  i've been with the company for 7 years, close to 8 including time as temp.i started at $18 through a technical and engineering temp company, after 10 months i received a offer letter for a quarter more, i was more or less happy, i was making $9 earlier in the year at one job and started making $16 at another. i was laid off and then interviewed for my current position a few days later. my supervisor suggested i ask for more and i settled on $19 an hour.in the 7 years preceding to today, i have had a merit/col increased a total of $2.87. next year's merit/col may be cancelled next year and our bonuses are now tied to corporate performance, which were weighted less than our individual goals, those are gone altogether now. i receive 5% of my annual salary and cannot count that in for next year based mostly on performing my goals.so merit/col increase is up in the air and our bonus is tied to a flailing companies performance on things like retention rate and happiness.i'm practically debt free, both vehicles are paid off, we have one random department store credit card and utilities and insurances.the kicker is, for those last 7 years we haven't had to pay a deductible for our insurance, copays did increase to dr $25 to $30, specialist from $35 to $50, and $250 er/scans, the free abulance rides are rolled in somewhere. i didn't use it, i use the va and my family uses the insurance.that was the reason for the below market value each position rate was adjusted for, we all accepted it, because enrollment cost nothing to have it, they had the lower plans, like enhanced with high deductibles. who knows why anyone would select it.for 2021, they added an employee contribution based on what type of family, for me it is now $109 biweekly to keep the same coverage. even after deleting a third of the workforce in two layoffs to go below the 500 employee threshold and beyond.it was a conversation non-starter because the basically 'free' when discussing pay, youre pretty much alone in that discussion. it's still that way because my loyalty to the company now overides my ability to support my family. i can see step by step where every dollar and cent was wasted, that would take forever to detail.that's what i was, their woes are now mine, i have zero impact on how the company performs, or at least through any dereliction of mine. they had to pay more through their own when they had someone try and do my job.with a very minute chance of getting a raise that matches fair market value which is around $27, it's a technical specialty within a broader technical specialty with very specific set of rules and design only a few technicians do. my company doesn't have an equivalent across 4 plants, it's a mix of several departments doing their individual parts, i do it all, i do all 3 functions, but not a specialist in those specific departments. they told me they saw value and they are interested in expanding.no idea if we're getting col/merit, at least based on least 2% of pay every year it was predictable, bonus not so much but it's set at 65% on the corporate goals, and personal goals which is waaay too open for interpretation, but i won't go into those fiascos.i receive a disability check from the va, but my daughter turns 18 this year so it drops a certain amount, i will approximate it to $500 a month next year.i have a really hard time conveying what i mean without it dissolving into lapses of train of thought, between the anxiety of asking for something and having anxiety, and fighting with this dissatisfaction with depression.what are the bounds of loyalty, what can you accept or disregard as to what constitutes loyalty? should i feel bad for 87 other people, because i demanded a raise, and their livelihoods are on the line because a pay raise would result in a possible epidemic?they are in another precarious december again, i took pto for our scheduled 'furlough' the day they cancelled it. i had to suffer 9 months of filing unemployment, requesting pto or losing out on furloughs and hours i couldn't make up. my 'loyalty' was stretched thin before the insurance change, even worse as they fumbled their way thru the pandemic.so my question is, we're stretched thin, we pay a lot to live where we are at, is it the right time to ask for a raise, while the company is in a slump. my 401k is almost dry, that's how i got to being totally debt free, but i have 2 kids, one a special needs who is 21 years old and a daughter about to graduate who i want to send to college.first things first is to move to a cheaper location, i fuel up once a month due to proximity, we spend excess in groceries right now because we can afford it, and i have about $12,500 in savings, i did help my mother with close to $18k for medical bills.community college, and i'll help with student loans there and after.my finances are are ok, and i can afford 3-4 months without a job, but i'll never get to that level and build what i have built, so i want to keep moving, i don't want another pathway, and it's not about a promotion, it's about equal pay that put off because of the insurance.i set my bar low, $25 an hour and i couldn't even reach that in 7 years, but without me they wouldn't get the money they are looking forward to for 2020. so no leverage there unless i move forward on to operation overload, but history tells me it wouldn't matter one bit, and i squandered any two weeks notice that would have had impact but i don't shit like that.but i don't know, that's why i'm here for any advice, suggestions and if this out of order and breaking any rules please delete and i'll find somewhere else, because im lost and want to be prepared this time, thanks to everyone reading and i'm sorry for the disorder, but if more information is needed i'll provide what i can honestly and truthfully. thanks.",9,1,"Asking for raise, due to benefit changes and matching fair market value.",Finance

16845,"hello all. recently in life i discovered the joy of traveling and i'd like to make a big decision which is to leave it all behind and live in another country and actually live my life. i'd like to do it soon while i have some youth left and can really enjoy myself rather than waiting until i'm an old man who's just looking to enjoy his twilight years in comfort. i figure by 35 i can have enough saved up to float a good long while in a place where my money goes a lot further. i currently make around $50k a year with no debt, only a cell phone, car insurance, and helping my mother out as far as bills go. i started a 401k last year and took a peek at it and found its currently at $15k. i have $18k just sitting in my bank account. assuming i can last at this job for the next 3 years what are my best options for growing my money and making it last while living relatively frugally abroad? i figure i can make some extra cash with freelance jobs online wherever i land but i don't really know how investing works honestly. would it be possible to keep a good chunk of my savings in the market and actually keep my money growing enough that it mostly offsets the bulk of my spending abroad? would i even be able to keep my 401k i have or would i be forced to withdraw it all when i leave the company and get hit with a lot of fees and taxes?any other advice for this situation would also be appreciated. thanks.",78,1,"31 looking to live my dream now, not wait until I'm old",Finance

(look those up).whole life or permanent life insurance has a very low return.  you are better off with a term life insurance policy to cover a mortgage or living expenses if you or your spouse should need it (if one of you would unable to cover expenses should the other pass away suddenly). you could get a term policy and also use some sort of mutual fund to build up a fund to supplement after the 20 or 30 years of your term expires if you are still in need of mortgage coverage by that time.i have the utmost sympathy in your plight as earlier in life, i was suckered similarly, by someone selling products through my employer (on the premises of where i worked). unfortunately, these types of companies are not transparent in the amount of fees they collect from you.  i would get out as soon as you can!best wishes, and hoping you get clear (or got clear) of this lady!",3,1,I know this is old...but...,Finance

18840,"a bit over 2 years ago, my life changed a lot. i got a new job, making a much higher salary. i also got into a serious relationship, with an age gap between us, which made me start thinking of an early retirement. i've been muddling around for a year or so, but still don't feel like i know where to start. do i need to seek out a financial advisor for figuring out my plan, or is this something i can tackle myself with online resources?i'm 35 now. my fiance is 51, and we are planning to get married in the fall of this year if covid doesn't make us change our plans. if he retires at 65 (current plan), then i have 14 years to save if i want to try to retire with him. together, we make far more money than we know what to do with, and the subject of early retirement for him as come up. if he decides to go for an earlier retirement, i'd like to try to match him. but i don't know what i would need for that.retirement calculators all seem to be based off ""current salary"", but as i said i got a huge pay increase with my job change a few years ago, and my lifestyle has not kept up with the extra money. i sincerely doubt i'd need to match my current pay to live comfortably. together, we spend maybe $5-6k/month with very little restraint in our spending. of that, about $2400 goes towards the mortgage of both our houses (his is rented out right now) and $400 goes towards a car loan. assuming those were paid off, i could see us easily living happily on $3k/month, plus maybe a bit extra for vacations. $4k/month would be nice. how do i take this number and figure out what i need to retire, and how much i need to put away now to make that happen?current assets* my previous job a few years ago was for a large us bank that offered a generous 401k match, and right now i have roughly 55k sitting around in some low expense aggressive blackrock index fund.* my new job has a 401k match program that i became eligible for last year, and it only has around 20k in it right now.* our current home was purchased 2 years or so ago, and we still owe somewhere around $125k on it. we make an extra principal payment towards it each month, and i hope to get it paid off within 10 years. it's valued at around $180k (i bought it cheaper than that in a fixer-up state, and used the proceeds of my previous home's sale to pay for the repairs)* my fiance's mortgage still has about $70k left on it, and his house is worth maybe $150k.* i started an vanguard ira around two ago, which has about 14k in it.* we have a savings account with 25k or so in it, although half that is earmarked for the wedding.* my salary is $120k, and his is somewhere a bit over $70k (not sure exact figure). the house rental brings in roughly $15k/year, but that's not necessarily a reliable source of income and primarily goes towards paying the mortgage and repairs for that place. altogether, we bring in about 10k a month. from that, i put aside $750/mo into a roth 401k, and he puts aside 10% of his salary into his which is around $700 (plus his company's match). i have maxed my ira contribution the last 2 years, and plan to continue to do so. every few months we tend to accumulate a bunch of money and either put it towards some of the larger house improvements around here or dump it into the mortgage or savings accounts.i have no idea what the correct thing to do is with our extra money, and neither does my fiance. we're both used to much more frugal lifestyles, and this is our first time in a dual-income-no-kids relationship. the idea of retiring early hadn't crossed our minds before, and i'm not sure where to start.",15,1,Do I need a financial advisor to figure out my retirement plan?

20656,"some background: my husband got a huge promotion in 2020, and together we ended up making almost four times what we had been earning in years before. gross income was around $400,000. we have our taxes all figured out with a good accountant, so we have been paying estimates and should be all set there. we have a very detailed budget (thanks to starting ynab a year ago), with an emergency fund to cover six months expenses, and lots of other cash marked for dealing with other predictable future expenses. we are both around 40. we have zero debt.retirement: in the past, we haven’t had much extra to put into retirement funds. we each have small roth iras (only about $5000 in each) from before his income went above the limit. he is partly on salary, with benefits, and partly self-employed in his position. his employer matches 3% of his salary (which is only $48,000, the rest comes from self-employment) into his simple sep, which now has a balance of $17,000 from the past few years of being employed there. we have made contributions to take full advantage of the match, but we are otherwise way behind on funding our retirement. we only contributed $1700ish in 2020 to the employer retirement plan, pretty much just enough to get the full match. we did not know how amazing this year would be for him, because of pandemic-related changes to the business. this year we will be setting up retirement accounts for each of us through my husband's corporation, where i am a 5% owner and on payroll for my administrative duties, so i know that will be good for building up our retirement savings even more. but i'm wondering if there is anything we can do now to make any retirement contributions for 2020 (i know i should have dealt with this sooner). i've read about backdoor ira contributions and i don't completely understand but maybe that would be a good option for us? we have $45,000 sitting in our ""new house fund"" that we could use some of for a big ira contribution if that would make more sense. that brings me to my next question…housing: we currently live in a rental house in a hcol area, a suburb of a really expensive city. my husband already has a big commute to work so i don't want to move any farther away. our rent is $2500 now, for a tiny 4br house for us and our 3 kids. we like our house but there are a few issues, the biggest being that we all share one bathroom, and that is tough sometimes with our kids becoming teens. our lease is up soon and we will have the option to renew. we have never been in a position to buy a house before, and i do want to make sure we proceed carefully and are fully prepared for such a big decision. to get a house in our current city with 4 brs and at least 1.5 baths, it would cost around $700,000. i worked with a mortgage broker in december to see what was possible, and we got pre-approved for a $600,000 mortgage, also would wait a few more months until we have $100k or more for down payment. i know that i would need to plan for bigger monthly expenses, including taxes and home maintenance if we do buy a house. i have done a lot of research on this part.so here's where the maybe unusual employment situation comes in. my husband’s income accounts for 90% of our total, as i only work part-time. he has just secured a three-year contract, which is a big deal for us because one-year contracts are common in his industry. his job is physically demanding, and disability insurance is not possible due to the nature of his work (i have looked into it). it is written into his contract that if he becomes unable to do his job for 60 days, he will lose the position. this fact already concerned me, and as i sit here typing this out, i realize that i should be concerned and probably we should continue to rent and keep our expenses low, and save as much as we can while we can. am i thinking about this the right way? it’s so tempting to look around at the houses we can technically “afford” right now. and so enticing to think about owning our own place.thanks for reading!

21446,"timeline and summary first, questions at the end.  to be brief, we adopted a large sibling group from foster care (4+) that created a large tax offset (adoption tax credit).  we don't make enough to actually use that tax credit, until years later a layoff happened that resulted in a modest disbursal that included a fixed, up-front 25% tax withholding.   come tax time (jan 2020), the tax credit kicks in and fully negates the withholding, resulting in a moderate tax refund.  timeline plays like this:* filed in jan 2020, electronic, with auto-deposit, same as all prior years* accepted by irs before feb 15th, immediately put on hold due to new laws that require hold on returns with eic/dependents - hold period allows up to 60 days* covid hits, shuts down irs halfway through the hold period* irs opens back up in may-ish, they state they have a new 60 day period and the first one just gets magically reset because of the shutdown* they run it out to day 60 and then say it's been flagged for review to determine if it should be audited - that generates another 60 day hold* they run that timer out to day 60 and then determine, yes in fact, we are going to send this to the audit/exam department* audit/exam department gets it, says ""nope, this is 100% in order and never should have been sent to us"" and almost immediately kicks it back to the first group that's been holding it all year - that was early november* first group says okay you are clear, you should have refund by dec 15th* call back around dec 10th, get someone that is super helpful and explains that in fact, the processing group that has been holding it hasn't actually done anything at all with it - it's just sitting there, and from the date of my call they'll put in a referral requesting that something be done with it but that group now has a -  you guessed it - new 60 day timer to respond.* i was further told in an indirect fashion that this would be a waste of time because they still wouldn't do anything at the end of the 60 days and it would be a good idea to contact taxpayer advocatethe referral to the advocate was set up - they were supposed to contact me within 7 business days.  no contact.   attempt to contact them, it goes to a voicemail whose box is full and you can't leave a message.    and now the ""where's my refund?"" link doesn't even work anymore because they've taken it down to ready it for the new tax year.  mortgage is behind, debt is increasing, and there is literally no end in sight on this.  i fully understand covid has messed everything up but while that may partly explain the situation it does not excuse it and i can't afford to simply leave it at that and walk away.   we are literally talking about someone just needs to click a mouse button to solve all my problems and i need help figuring out how to make that happen or find other ways to deal with the knock-on effects that the absence of this refund has caused (ie mortgage behind, debt, etc).     yes, the stimulus will help deal with some of the debt but at this point that is like throwing a band-aid on a knife wound.   is there any way to force or request some sort of supervisor intervention with the irs?    is there any workarounds to taxpayer advocate being completely non-responsive?   is there any other suggestions or ideas about different ways to try and achieve resolution here or just suggestions in general on how to deal with this mess.   any constructive input is greatly appreciated.",7,1,"IRS still withholding refund filed in Jan 2020 has created a desperate situation, need advice",Finance

21592," **hi reddit fam...i feel so helpless right now. i've cross-posted this in legal\_advice but someone told me i should post it here for advice too**to briefly bring my situation up to speed: i'm an idiot who signed a lease and paid a year's rent in cash in advance for a discount (i have the lease and receipt of the payment acknowledged), but it turns out there are severe habitability issues with my unit bc...my landlord lied to me! it's an illegal unit, never had permits, and now after taking my money for the year my landlord is trying to illegally evict me on false premises claiming i run an illegal business, i've moved in subtenants, etc (it's all false and frivolous). i believe my landlord is retaliating b/c i pointed out severe habitability issues after moving in that weren't getting better, that they think i'm young and stupid since they already have my money in cash that they can screw me over. i moved in mid september and paid for the lease from end of aug. 2020 to aug. 2021. i signed the lease in good faith and thought everything was proper, and the landlord offered a discount if i paid in advance, then they asked me for it via text partially in cash, then in person for totally in cash - so it was a large amount (15,600 for 1300 a month) from my savings but i trusted them because i'm an idiot...i have receipt of the rent on my lease, so at least there's that. weird comments and the increasingly shady behavior of my landlord paired w/ the habitability issues made me suspect something was off about the unit after i moved in. after getting the 3 day notice (this was a no cure notice posted on my wall) earlier this month, i called the city to verify my if it was legal and then i found out they have no permit, so the city did an inspection the week afterwards. now they have a month to either start getting permits or convert the garage back (but they can request an extension due to covid). interestingly...it also looks like they may be getting foreclosed on (b/c i went on la county's website to search for court records, and i found an unlimited civil lawsuit they filed against their mortgage service providers the same day the inspector from the city showed up...i can't tell if they're trying to forestall a foreclosure, but i'm beginning to think its to hide their assets - they're also asking for the quiet title to the property, maybe to protect against a judgement lien?)**i think the key issue here is that they don't want to return my money for rent paid in advance for the remaining months and will hide assets on paper.** when i've begun reaching out to law firms for help in civil/tenant law to sue for my money back/tenant harassment/etc, some contingency firms are (rightfully) worried it is not lucrative enough for them to collect upon for a judgement (if no assets, can't bleed a stone). i am convinced there are assets but this is the issue i'm running into...i cannot afford to pay a private lawyer hourly for this.one lawyer wants 1k to write a demand letter and phone calls with my landlord's lawyer in an attempt to settle and get my prepaid rent for the year back .another lawyer has told me he honestly doesn't think it is lucrative enough for him to do this on contingency and if he did, he'd be taking 30% and feels bad about the amount relative to my situation/age (i'm 28) - he is willing to coach me through and give me legal advice when he has time because he says he finds this completely unfair but he won't represent me. another law firm wants to wait until next month, end of january, when my landlord is due to respond to the city for their notice of violation (renting me an illegal unit) - my particular city in la has no tenants rights for me in this situation (i got this in writing from the city atty's office) i do not know what to do, i feel like a sitting duck. at this rate, the last email i got from my landlord's lawyer is trying to subtly threaten me by saying they won't file an unlawful detainer if i negotiate moving out in 15-30 days, but let's be real - they've made no mention of returning my money...probably because they either don't have it, don't want to give it back, or both? in case they are being foreclosed on and their civil lawsuit is not a stalling tactic, even worse...at this point, i feel so hopeless because i don't know what to do - i feel like a sitting duck - either they file an unlawful detainer, they're bluffing, or something else i don't think any judge is going to be sympathetic to their unlawful detainer bc it is (firstly) defectively done (it was posted on my wall when i was at work, but i never got a copy in the mail and we share a mailbox...also, the notice didn't specify dates of my supposed lease violations...since it's all bullshit), 2nd full of false reasons, and 3 i paid rent upfront in good faith for 4 what turned out to be an illegal unit.i literally don't know what to do. spend 1k on a lawyer writing an email to their lawyer? legal aid clinics can't help me right now bc there is no unlawful detainer filed. another lawyer has told me if it gets to the unlawful detainer stage, it'll be even more expensive for me. i've learned my lesson to never pay upfront even for a discount but god, please, does anyone have insights or help please?

how do i protect myself? what is my best option here? here is a short list of points that i hope help this post. 1. i rent commercial warehouse properties.2. my lease says no liens or lease is void.3.  architect 1 and architect 2 are scammers at best. architect 3 is an angel.4. architect 2 tries to scam for $xx,xxx.5. i contested the charges immediately upon receipt of the last invoice and requested all my money back for failing to do the project how i wanted.here is the story. every business start up needs a change of use to make sure codes and regulations are met. architect 1 was hired to do the job, but they charged duplicate hours. all measurements of the building were redone, and redone, and redone again. it made no sense. its a square building. turns out, they were just burning hours to make money. they were sneaking onto job site when nobody was there and claiming time. found out when i swapped there key and they brought a crew down and they were all locked out. they told me the measurements were already done during a prior conversation before the lock out. architect 1 isn't in the picture any longer.&amp;#x200b;architect 2 was approached in hopes that we could have an alternate work ethic and they picked up where the last left. we used all the documents from architect 1 to bring architect 2 up to speed. architect 1 is important because it shows proof of our change of use concept and layout. i was quoted x an hour, z per assistant, and no more than $x,xxx to complete the project. this architect refused to make the print how i illustrated. there is nothing wrong with my draft. nothing illegal or in conflict of building code. architect 1 did it no problem. architect 2 wanted to render half my building useless, build random walls and demolition random walls that are pristine and structurally sound. everything they wanted to do was 100% unnecessary and wasn't even remotely close to my drawing. i approached them with all of the errors and complete oversights and demanded they do what i told them or i am not paying. architect 2 then sent an invoice for 3 x the entire project value to fix all the errors. sigh..... i actually went back to check my drawing i sent him to confirm i didn't make a mistake, how could it seriously happen again???.... and holy shit, they did not follow anything i said again. i cannot believe this.  i cannot believe this.  i cannot believe this. i immediately disputed the charges with specific reasons stated as to why they messed up and how they caused themselves 3x hours for not reading or looking at my drawing and emails. i used specific language and precise measurements. they even stated the corrections they made in email when i pointed them out. when making these corrections, they didn't 'realize' that all the extra fake work they did, didn't have to be done, but left it there anyways. i asked for all my money back. they ignored me. they said i could set up a meeting and discuss further work on this project. they charge for meetings. they charged me to pay an invoice in person and to explain to them they did everything wrong. is this even legal? they then ceased all communication with me.  i have no clue how this person has their license still, but i am here ask for help. i have been sent to collections for services i didn't request. at this point i walked away from the first and second invoice payments because i found that a lawyer costs more than my first 2 invoices.architect 3 spent about 15 hours on the project from scratch and completed it in 10% of the time. he only charged 10% more. this architect is not a scammer. zero hassle, 1 visit to the site.1 year later i get a call from collections. i received a call from collections stating how i have been so hard to find. they claim the architect attempted so many times to invoice me and i couldn't be reached. the architect never sent another invoice at all. they just waited, made zero contact, and sent it to collections. all prior invoices came directly to email. i did not receive the collections call, but the call came in at place where all 3 architects have been hired. they told my family member i owed debt and they have been trying to find me. the architect has my email, address, and phone number and never once followed up after my dispute,  but claims in the collections email that multiple attempts were made to claim the debt. none of which is true.&amp;#x200b;i am currently filling out a complaint to the cfbf. i will send the same documents over to the state licensing board to review his professional violations. i am preparing a letter to ask the collector to validate the debts and prove how i owe them, but the story behind it all is why the claim is false and my understanding is they only have to validate the invoice(name, company, etc). is this a  dead end?  anyone have any advice where to go on the complaint side? i was going to walk away from the invoices i paid, but i am contemplating legal action for all my funds back.architect 2 has be disingenuous the entire time and i fully expect to end up in court, but i am more concerned with a lien on the buildings i rent which is a violation of lease. what should i do? am i doing it right? should this move to legal advice?",8,1,"[Throwaway] Sent to collections over an invoice for work I didn't request multiple times, Architect is a scammer.",Finance

24961,"**tl;dr** i was financially abused most of my life. my mom straight up ghosted me and now i am in a financial hole. seeking advice.&amp;#x200b;when i (34f) was 12 years old, my mom started her first business and i was her first ‘employee.’ she wasn’t very good at that ‘computer stuff’ and would wake me up in the middle of the night because she needed some document typed up.fast forward a few years to when i was 16, and i was officially hired as an actual employee. business was great! she started buying expensive clothes, cars, jewelry, purses. the business kept growing and a couple years later, when i was 18, my mom had extra funds to open other businesses under my name. “it’s an investment for your future!” she said.fast forward another few years when the business started doing not so well. my mom threw herself a huge 50th birthday soiree that cost thousands of dollars. she put it on my no-limit amex and never paid it. she started giving me more for my ‘salary,’ but i had to endorse one check per month to the owner of the huge house we were renting. i also paid the house’s utilities with my salary. did the groceries, made sure the cleaning people were paid. basically managed the household. when her business really started to tank, she could no longer pay me. to be clear, i actually did work lol. i did her billing and helped with the bookkeeping, among other things. “just hang on a little longer” she said. “we have to put the employees’ payroll first. we can’t pay ourselves. but we’ll get out of this!”well, we never got out of it. i loaned her everything in my savings account and didn’t take a salary for months. i had to take out a loan to pay my rent and bills. but that’s ok, she moves to a different state to start a new company! ‘great!’ i thought, ‘now she can finally start paying me back all that she owes me.’ so again, i start doing her billing and bookkeeping remotely. at this point, i had already found another job, so was only doing my mom’s things part time. my income was roughly 60% new job, 40% mom job.new business was ok. we definitely weren’t making the kind of money we were before, but enough. until business, again, took a turn. yet my mom kept spending money as if she was still raking in the dough. procedures to her face, shopping, vacations. fast forward to 3 weeks ago. she was 2 payrolls behind on paying her employees (including myself) when i finally found that balls to stand up to her. i told her i was worried about her because if her employees also found balls, she will have nothing. this woman owes the irs close to $300k and isn’t even supposed to be taking a salary right now. whatever money she was/is taking from the company wasn’t/isn’t being taxed. she also couldn’t pay our payroll vendor anymore, so turned all of us into contract employees. (don’t worry, i put 35% of any income i got from her into a savings account to pay my taxes).well, she didn’t like what i had to say. without a word to me, she distributed my responsibilities to her other employees and locked me out of the company bank account. i’ve tried calling, e-mailing, and texting. no response. so i guess i have been effectively fired. i can definitely live off of the 60% that i’m making at my current job, but it's going to be tough. what i am worried about now is repaying the loans i took out to keep myself afloat when her first business failed.so reddit, is there anything i can do? or am i shit out of luck? if anything, i just wanted others to hear my story in case they are going through something similar. if it feels wrong (even if it’s your parents and they are doing things ‘for your own good’), put your foot down and firmly say no.note: yes, i am currently seeking therapy. it has taken me 34 years, but i have finally realized that i was a parentified child and was financially abused.thanks for reading.",6,1,Lost 40% of income due to being 'fired' by my mom.,Finance

24976,"a little theoretical here, and this can be a complex topic with many variables and no simple answers, but, decisions are best made with simple information. i have thus far in life decided to not buy a house, running the calculations and living in very modest and well priced rentals instead. but life is now shifting. my math was simple - let the landlord worry about all taxes, repairs, etc. &amp; avoid transaction fees as i have moved a fair amount. i probably would have taken a harder look at buying earlier if my career was more stable. (and although i would have made out nicely with price appreciation over the last 10 years, it was unprecedented growth i don't expect to be able to rely on for the future, unless i get lucky). on top - after the math &amp; analysis i did, i found that in my case, there was a very minimal difference in expenses (all in) between renting and buying, even when accounting for building equity. as long as i saved what would go into equity, i would only be slightly worse off renting, but retain the flexibility i needed. i'm moving from a medium col to a hcol area, and deciding to take a step up in quality of life as well (nicer house &amp; neighborhood) while staying well within my budget. so here's the question:  as i face the prospect of rent going up by 50% to 100% due to the move &amp; lifestyle upgrade, i'm feeling a lot more pressure to buy instead of rent. this however seems to go against the idea of ""rent luxury, buy value"" - although expensive doesn't necessarily have to mean luxury, it could still be value...value doesn't have to be cheap to be value. would the rent vs. buy math change in favor of one or the other as you move up and down the cost of living and lifestyle expense spectrum?",13,1,Renting vs Buying a House,Finance

26851,"firstly let me thank everyone for answering my questions last time i posted to help my girlfriend file her taxes. things worked out sorta well. she got her state rebate fairly quickly. my second question will come back to this, but first....so here is the scenario. when i was born my mother opened an investment fund. over the intervening 38 years she forgot about it. i don't recall exactly what kind of fund it is, but it was the kind where the money could only transfer to me when i became of age. a few months ago she got a letter then the investment fund or manager or whatever realized i was now an adult and they stopped trading with those funds and instructed her that the money had to be transferred to me. this money comes out to about 50k. now half is going to my sister (i have zero issue with this) and the other half is technically mine, though over the last 20 years since i've turned 18 i've cost my parents a lot of money. legal fees, car repairs, medical fees, school, and they paid for my co-op where i live now among other things. by all rights i owe my parents this money, i have no problem with them keeping the 25k.however i'd like to talk to my mother and convince her to at least take some of it to re-invest again for the future. i read this sub casually and i'm fairly sure one of the first responses is going to be ""hire a fiduciary"" and i'll suggest that, but i also wanted to at least start looking in the right direction to suggest what to invest in...in general i'd want us to invest in solar and wind, things that will pay off in another 10-20 years the way her initial investment did. google/apple/nintendo all riskier, but likely to be stable investments in the long run. she actually works for a real estate investment company in nyc as a bookkeeper so she's not altogether unfamiliar with this but from my conversations with her she's never done stuff like this. she forgot about this fund afterall!so i guess my question is, what kind of funds should i suggest we look into, or ask the fiduciary about if we hire one. if she agrees with me to re-invest 10-15k what should we look into that will grow with time, and maybe even pay out dividends 10 years from now if she wants to retire. is something that pays out dividends earlier even possible? i don't think the amount is high enough to yield dividends worth anything right away right? or am i wrong about that?oh, and before anyone suggest paying down debt, i'll be suggesting that as well. if i learned one thing reading this place casually is that paying down debt is one of the first steps to investing. i have more then one cards with intrest i'd like to pay down and i don't know if she does, but ask her to consider doing that with me as well. my second question pertains to my girlfriend. i helped her file her taxes using the free tax filing tool, and we couldn't submit her federal taxes digitally. when the first covid checks were being sent out, we forgot that she was working last year and was going to file taxes, she previously did not. so we used the tool to make sure the irs had her direct deposit information and like instructed put 0 for what she filed the previous year. we figured this is where we messed up and we were told to just mail in an amended return and the amended return would be considered and would fix it.well she got her state refund fairly quickly but she never got her federal refund and she never got her 1200 covid check either. everytime we used the tool to see the status of her payment we got a message that there was no info at this time. we gave up after 2 months. now that april is coming up on us again and we're getting 600$ checks this time, i got mine already and we get the feeling she wont get hers again. we double checked with her parents to ensure they were not claiming her or filing for her, as she's 27. they claim they did not and we trust their word on this.so what can she do to get to the bottom of this? between her federal rebate and the two covid checks she's missing over almost 2500 combined that the feds owe her. i think we tried some hotline number provided on the site the tool was but we got disconnected after 2 hours. i want to help her get whats properly owed to her.thank you for your time!",4,1,Investing some Found Money and another question about Tax Rebates.,Finance

[this article](https://www.kiplinger.com/retirement/601665/retirees-make-the-most-of-your-home-equity) has a helpful description, and it currently has me convinced that it's a sound strategy.  i'd appreciate it if anyone could explain potential downsides to a strategy like this: buy a $1m home, spend most money on paying down the mortgage instead of investing in retirement savings, pay the house off in 30 years, retire via a reverse mortgage. i presume there will be *some* savings as well to cover fun &amp; emergency expenses (since a $500,000 reverse mortgage works out to an annual ""income"" of $17,000 over an optimistic 30 years of retirement). i guess the big ""catch"" is property tax - that's going to remain at least $10,000 per year, which will eat up most of that $17,000 - this alone could be enough to squash this idea.  i'd appreciate any other pros/cons on this topic - thanks in advance!",2,1,"Retiring by going back into debt on a house - is there a name for this, and why isn't this something discussed more often?",Finance

29267,"credit is complicated and i’m trying to get a better handle on it. i want to optimize it for the next year so we can get a great loan for a house. so here is my current situation my credit is about 730s, and it was higher before christmas time and applying for home loans earlier in june that we ended up not moving on. i had 3 lines of credit (before yesterday) at a limit of $1500 or above, and i’m at a utilization of 25%. this is because we got a new mattress and we are doing it in payments, my utilization was at about 13% before that. yesterday i impulsively got a credit card at a store so i could get a discount (not my best day), so now i have two new lines of credit within a month and it puts my average age of credit below three years, since my oldest account is 6 years and the other one besides the two new ones is almost 3years old. the new card limit is only $550, so is it better to keep it after i pay it off immediately and just not use it? or would it be better to close the account and bump up the average age of my credit since it would close the account? is this how it works? originally, i was planning on applying for a higher limit credit card once we had the mattress paid off, so we can have a really low credit utilization between the open accounts we have (since i really only use one credit card and pay it off each month). what are your thoughts to just get crazy good credit?",9,1,Does closing a newly opened credit card hurt your credit?

1682,i’m twenty going on twenty one in january. i go to my local community college i bombed two semesters and put myself severely behind my peers but recently have gotten the hang of school and have been realizing it as a priority. but i still have no idea what to do when it comes to a degree or wether or not to transfer to an actual uni when i get my associates. even that opens a can of worms because do i go out of my city for uni or choose to stay at the one near me? i’m worried that i’m stuck and i can’t find a way out because i have no plan or goal in mind. everyone i know has a career in mind that they are passionate about but if i’m being honest i just want a job where i can make the most money to fund hobbies and live comfortably my main goal in life since i was in middle school was to own a porsche 911 some day. i make minimum wage and still live at home i pay for my own bills but still feel like i’m mooching off my family and i feel bad. this has been more of a rant than anything but is anybody else in the same boat? i really hope i find a way out of this rut. i know lots of people have it way harder than me and don’t even have the ability to attend school at all or own a car or have a roof over there head so i also feel like a giant douche for being upset about my situation but it gives me a ton of stress and anxiety for my future.,3,6,Am I supposed to not have any idea of what I am doing with my life?,Adult

2209,"  this is an update post on a post i made on here a few months ago about leaving my parents and everything i knew to better myself as a person and my mental health as a whole. this is more or less how it's going and what i've realized about myself over these last few months. i'm making this with the intent that some of you can learn from this or even uses the mistakes i've made to better yourself.to understand the story of how i got to this point you have to understand my upbringing. you see i don't exactly come from good people. it took me a long time to realize this and to be completely honest with you it still hasn't sunk in properly. my real father is a wife and child beater that didn't care about anything but himself and what he could gain by using you. my mother is a nice person upfront but is a manipulator and a bully for a lack of a better term, that being said she never laid a hand on me and tried to do her best. that still does not excuse her actions on how she was. my stepfather is the only person i can truly say was a good parent to me even if he had his own screw-ups with him serving in the military. he wasn't kind or forgiving. he belittled be and did make me feel as though i was an awful person, but i feel i wouldn't be the person i am today if he didn't push me to not be that kid that went and hid even if he didn't do it in a good way, but to be fair i wasn't exactly the nicest kid.with all these negative influences surrounding me, i never knew how to act. i would through fits, get in fights for no reason with them, and shut people out just for talking to me. on top of all that i would deliberately lock myself in my room just so i didn't have to talk to anyone because i thought if i did that no one would have to deal with me. i would have trouble sleeping because if i wasn't up when my parents were up i would get the power in my room shut off so i learned the sound of their footsteps and would make up instinctively right before they opened my door.there's more detail in between but i don't want this to be ten pages long. from all that about 6 months ago i moved into my grandparents to try to better myself. i lived with them when i was younger because i felt safer there and after my parent's divorce we ended up living there anyway. they are very kind and supportive and see where i fall behind and just want to see me be the best person i can be. we made all our friends there too. it’s been a positive experience overall and my mental health has gone up a lot and i'll be going back to school again. while living here i've noticed things about myself that i didn't know were there till i started acting more human for lack of a better term.i had my first dream since i was thirteen, four months ago, it was a strange experience and i cried when i woke up not because the dream was sad but because it was the first time since i was thirteen that i felt safe enough to fall into a deep enough sleep to dream in the first place. i didn't realize how important it was till i got it back and how much just feeling safe can have on a person. it's surreal for me to think that a year ago i was thinking of killing myself and just a year later i can feel safe again.the biggest challenge i'm facing at the moment is social interaction or just making friends in general. i know how to put on a fake smile and act normal for the most part. but what i'm working on is not being fake and just trying to be myself. my only problem is i really don't know where i begin and the fake me ends. it's frustrating to try to be yourself when even you don't know who you are, to begin with. right now i'm just trying to talk to random people and just be as real as i can be. finding myself is something i never thought i would be doing let alone struggling within this way so it’s a hard realization but one i've come to expect.on the lighter side of things, i've got myself a car and a job that fits with the career path i've chosen. it was hard when i didn't have a job for almost a year but i got right back into things. i recently started hanging out with old friends i had here. although we have nothing really in common its a good jumping-off point. on top of all that like in said earlier i’ll be starting back up in school again so i can finally chase the degree i've always wanted. my hope is that i continue in this upward spiral so i can continue bettering myself and those around me.to sum it all up i made this post to get my raw feelings and emotions out in the open. i've never really opened up to people, or at least as long as i can remember so i'm doing this to get myself more open to talking and hopefully soon have the courage enough to see a therapist that can give me professional help because opening up to a screen to random people on the internet isn't the best way to do it. if at all possible even if you hated this, liked it, or even found that you could relate to some of my problems please just remember this. even if hell seems to be knocking at your door and you have nothing else just remember there’s always a brighter tomorrow.&amp;#x200b;as i'm finishing this its 1 am. i would like to thank you for reading the ramblings of this 20-year-old weirdo who probably is going to regret this later. the writing in this isn't the best and again it's late but i just needed to get my thoughts

or at one point, was an ape-like creature? would that seem silly? how then would we speak to the nature of humanity, our intellect, our spirituality, our morality, our rationality and consciousness, our need for purpose in life?&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;https://i.redd.it/qm83l9ztsl561.gif&amp;#x200b;&amp;#x200b;https://i.redd.it/4ig2cwnvsl561.gif&amp;#x200b;to be made in the image of god, it means we resemble god in substance. we have value, dignity and morals. we have unique relational abilities able to communicate and love, and we are able to represent god in what we do. being made in the image of god speaks to human exceptionalism, not simply descending from ape common ancestry.and this can be supported further by the archaeological and fossil records, as well as molecular anthropological findings.humans, as we are now, suddenly appeared on earth 100,000-150,000 years ago. there is no evolutionary evidence showing earlier hominds (ape-like creatures) or neanderthals evolving into the modern humans we have today. these creatures went extinct, and then there was a sudden appearance of modern humans. this is also indicated by the sudden appearances of art and symbolism, the “sociocultural big bang”, signs of creativity and intellect that didn’t exist in the same way prior, but appeared at the same time modern humans did.it is also critical to note that neanderthals, though they were on earth longer than modern humans were, their technological creations remained static, there was no advancement. while modern humans started out with archaic tools and have since made numerous technological advancements within less time.the fossil record also indicates that human brains are different from neanderthal brains, noticeably from the skull shapes, confirming that we are in fact distinct. the human brain actually has an expanded parietal lobe and the area of the brain required for vision was much larger in the brains of neanderthals than in the human brain. this actually would diminish the capacity for cognitive thought for neanderthals.&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/9ifftzk5tl561.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=351c0fa5d8e8b02e3ef51c07968b1d3302de7385&amp;#x200b;https://preview.redd.it/2nma2qg6tl561.jpg?width=3780&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cdaf3e5ff9728fa2ca2c921705e95184af261780so when we suddenly appeared on the earth 100,000-150,000 years ago, we were already designed to be exceptional.&amp;#x200b;**\*\*\*i'd love to hear your thoughts everyone! feel free to comment!\*\*\***1. ham, ken, hugh ross, deborah haarsma, and stephen c. meyer, *four views on creation, evolution and intelligent design* *(*zondervan, 2017*) ,* 139",1,1,The Origins of Humanity ~ There's Something We Should Ask Ourselves... ~,Adult

[edit: i apologize for the long long post, but if you choose to read it all i thank you] so as with the title yes i have may have suspicious activity in my house with my family. here's what i have so far and i'm trying to debunk this ""suspicious activity"".so it all started with my little brother of 6. two days ago he had peed on the couch in the living room where he slept the night and that never happens. of course he got in trouble. the living room is connected to some (up)stairs, the kitchen with no door, and three rooms (1 bathroom &amp; 2 bedrooms). one bed room also doesn't have a door. the kitchen has a door that leads to another room behind the kitchen. tonight before i had gone to bed (my family and i were all gathered in my parents bedroom laughing) my little brother said he had heard the door in the kitchen open. now here's the thing, i had said that the living room is connected to the kitchen with no door, but the kitchen is connected to another room with a door. in that other room we only keep a dog in there.(i forgot we also have a cat too).  it also has a private bathroom. for one of my family members to use the bathroom they would use bathroom already connected to the living room which is closer. after hearing this i had the realization that what if my little brother peed the couch because he had heard the door open? of course, as stated before, he had peed the couch 2 days ago and he had heard the door open at night last night. maybe he didn't pee last night when the door opened because he got in trouble. also, i think maybe 2 nights ago or last night, my little brother had asked for him to sleep with me. i told him no (not knowing) but that i would stay with him until he fell asleep. might also add that we have crazy neighbors too. the dude gets at like 2 or 3 am and either goes or come back in his truck and it makes a lot of noise. sometimes hell also just turn the truck on for no reason, go nowhere, and then turn it off and go back in. other times, they'll take their dog out, same hours too 2 or 3 am, and then later be yelling get in!! or now!! two or three times. maybe my little brother got scared from my neighbors slamming the door, oftentimes,  but then how does that make him think the door in the kitchen open and got him scared? right now i'm staying up to see if i can hear any noise or possibly see and my other littler brother of 15 is also helping me( he chose to do so). if you got any kind of idea possibility of what mightve happened please comment because i'm trying to debunk. to be honest my mind keeps going to paranormal shit but i am refraining from that idea and using logic for the moment because my family and i do have a bad history of paranormal stuff happen in our last house but that's for a different time.",1,2,Suspicious Activity in my house.?

3061,"so i organized a small party of about 10ish people last night. spent a week planning and spent about 100 bucks. edit:tldr: long night of drinking ended with a broken up relationship and someone taking my gun out of my car. gun was found in the oven. well, the night started at about 7 and started out fine. it was a mixture of my 2 friend groups and i finally got them all to meet. we all took a shot to start, and i got half of a cup, chugged it, and didnt drink anymore the rest of the night. enough to have a good time, but not too much to be able to make sure nobody did anything stupid. everything is going fine. about midnight rolls around and the 5 people that came in one car decided to leave. one of them stayed sober and didnt drink because he was driving them all home, so, works out great. i let them leave, they text me 30 minutes later telling me they made it home. so 2 girls, (we'll call them ashley and cait) started getting a bit touchy, but ashley's boyfriend is also at the party. (we'll call him mike). ashley starts getting her hands all over cait and is getting more and more drunk, i decided to cut her off after that. but it didn't stop what happened unfortunately. she starts taking caits shirt up and gives her a hickey on caits boob.obviously, mike (knowing ashley is bi) isnt happy anymore. mike is mad but doesnt do anything to her, they keep partying and i told them they need to start taking things easy as it's already 2 am. the next events took place in 1 hour and 15 minutes. 1 more person leaves, we are down to 5 of us. me, cait, ashley, mike, and a friend from work (we'll call him bobby). mike and ashley blow up into a raging arguement, mike steps towards her and starts screaming, so i push her into the door way behind her and shut the door and lock the 2 of us in there. effectively ending the arguement. i try to calm her down, it works a little bit but not enough. mike calms down enough that he decides he needs to leave. the last time he had a drink was 5 hours ago at this point, so i'm sure the adrenaline has helped lean off the last bit of the alcohol he was feeling. he insists on leaving. he grabs all of his shit from the apartment and starts loading it into his car. i take ashley into the bathroom and start to calm her down.once he grabs the last of his stuff, i take him outside. make sure he is good and reluctantly allow him to leave with the condition that he stay on the phone with me in my ear buds. i simply muted my end so he couldn't hear anything going on. thought that was the end? nah, this is where shit hits the fan.i carry a gun in my state. but when i go to parties, i lock it in my car under the driver seat. i went out to my car and go to grab my phone charger and notice my gun isnt there. my gun is missing....my gun..i have managed to stay a maintained calm all night, but this finally gets me. i'm freaking out now. the only person that has a track record of taking keys and losing them is ashley, the only other 2 people, cait and bobby, i've know for quite some time and know for a fact they would never do it. i immediately know ashley took my gun and hid it, thinking it was safer. she is now plastered at this point. cait is crying her eyes out because she played part in breaking them up, and bobby is on the floor puking into a cooler.  i'm not worried about them. i find my car keys in her room on the dresser. its confirmed, she took my keys and hid it my gun from the car because i left my keys on the hook on the door. she begs that it wasnt her, but i'm not worried about playing blame game. i know she took it. i'll deal with her later. it is now a matter of finding it. she is mad and says that i dont need my gun after drinking. i tell her i dont need it, i just need to know where it is and we can all go to sleep. she insists she doesnt have it, even tho she is saying she wont give it to me. so i inform her how serious the situation is. a missing firearm means i have to call the police for a stolen or missing firearm. which means we would all be questioned about it at the police station. and knowing she did it, it was a subliminal message that if i didnt get my gun, i was going to press charges. so i start scouting the apartment. nobody helps me look. i'm devouring this place looking for my gun. i looked for 30 minutes last night. wanna know where i found it? in the fucking oven. this bitch hid my gun in an oven..... a fucking oven...so now that the major hurdle is gone, i make sure  everyone goes to bed. ashley refuses to sleep or claim she took the gun. at the time i'm posting this, it's the morning after and i'm about to go into her room and fill her in on everything that happened and explain why i am not going to be her roomate in 2 months and that i'm not going to babysit her anymore when she drinks, nor will i invite her to drink. hell i dont know if i even want to be friends with her at this point. i dont want to be friends with someone that has a tendency to take guns when she is drunk.",6,1,My party last night went HORRIBLY wrong.,Adult

3280,"(i hope this isn’t too long, i’m desperate.)hey lads, fellow young adult here looking for some advice, maybe answers? so, i’m a female, currently twenty-two years old (turning twenty-three in a couple weeks) and i’ve never been in a relationship. i don’t feel bad about that, sometimes i feel i just lack a bit of self-awareness when it comes to going about that stuff. anyway-my real issue-there’s this guy at my work-he’s about thirty years old, i think? i don’t have a problem with dating people that are a bit older than me, but the thing is, i guess i exude the ‘never been in a relationship and is super shy’ vibe, to some people, specifically him. we’ve been working together for about five full months now, and it wasn’t until a few days ago we started to “really” talk outside of both of us saying ‘hello,’ him saying something vaguely flirty, and ‘goodbye.’ some of the conversations we’ve been having, have consisted of him flirting with me and me not knowing how to flirt, standing there saying “yeah?”; plus, some random conversations about hobbies, where we’re from, among other things. he’s also tried randomly holding/grabbing my hands?? but i think the main reason he started talking to me was because our (seasonal) job is ending in a couple of weeks and who gives a shit? in high school i got a lot of shit from people that would tell me they wanted to go on a date followed by the good old, “just kidding!” so of course, i still have the hardest time trusting whether someone is actually interested in me or is just saying shit for a goof. now back to my thirty year old coworker- it was actually just a few days ago that he broke the ice and we’d actually converse during work hours. he told me that i, “seemed super shy,” and i replied with, “yeah,” and the conversation went from there. i attempted to make conversation and continued with- “what are you doing after the season’s over?” and he replied with, “i don’t know… moving in with you lol.” i just laughed and brushed off his comments, but he still continued to make comments like that (which honestly, i didn’t mind). the same day, when i was headed out, telling him the usual, “see you tomorrow!” when i leave, he responds with, “see you later, cutie!” and i didn’t know how to react, so i just smiled, tilted my head at him, and blushed like crazy, feeling super embarrassed, yet also flattered? well, cut to the next day, he continued to flirt and continued saying things, one of them being, “you just keep luring me in,” to which i replied, “how? lol,” and he would finish off by saying, “i don’t know… there’s just something about you.” the way he told me that really sold it, honestly, but i was still filled to the brim with doubt. when he finished saying that, i asked him if he was being serious or if he was just joking with me, to which he replied, “i don’t know, i’ll let you decipher that,” which confused the hell out of me and made me feel even more doubtful. fast forward to today, we didn’t really talk at all, except for him telling me a stupid pick-up line and me laughing at it. he also didn’t really smile at me today, or even walk over, like he has been like he has the past few days, which caused me to ask one of my coworkers, i sometimes talk to, about him (throwback to me lacking self-awareness when it comes to relationships). i thought it was a good idea at the time (about four hours ago lol), but i’m sort of regretting asking at all. i asked my other coworker what the thirty year old’s deal was, to which my coworker asked me to clarify, to which i responded by saying, “i can’t tell if he’s joking ninety percent of the time. is he being serious or is everything a joke to him?” my coworker responded by telling me that, “he’s just like that haha,” to which i responded, “i don’t know honestly. he’s been telling me stuff. stuff like calling me a cutie? do you think he means that?” he told me that he’s pretty sure the thirty year old guy has a girlfriend, doesn’t know why he’d say that, and is most likely joking with me, to which i said “oh,” and went on to finish the most soul-crushing shift i’ve ever had.this dude has been leading me on for three fucking days and he might even have a girlfriend. and if he (hypothetically) doesn’t have a girlfriend, he’s either treating me like a fucking charity case and flirting with me to give me some self-esteem or something, flirting with me as a joke, testing his pick-up lines on me for the hell of it, or he was planning to get some side action, because he sees how shy and easily flattered i am. some other things that should be noted-he’s been talking to me like crazy at work, yet he hasn’t asked for my snapchat, number, or anything, which i find strange; the few, minute-long conversations i’ve had with him for the past five months, before a few days ago, consist of him saying something vaguely flirtatious like, “are you following me cause you can’t get enough of me?”; i also haven’t “officially” asked him if he has a girlfriend, and i feel like at this point, if anything the other coworker i was talking to earlier might’ve given him a head’s up, so i wouldn’t be surprised if the thirty year old most likely lies to my face.i’ve always found him attractive since i first saw him at work, but i was too much of a pussy to do anything about it. now that i’m getting all of this attention from him out of the blue, i have my doubts that he even means anything he says. i’m really upset that he can’t just be forthcoming with his words and just tell me whether he’s joking or not, or if he has a girlfriend. it’s seriously bumming me out. also, everything i wrote on here is stuff he’s actually told me. i don’t know how the statement “there’s just something about you,” with a longing stare can be contrived as anything other than flirtatious, so how the hell am i supposed to take it? i don’t mean to sound pretentious at all, i just really, really want some advice. this is all very new to me and i’ve mostly been having a hard time throwing myself into the dating game due to my crippling fear of rejection, and this is just complicating things and making me feel worse. any incite about how i can go about this would be appreciated b/c this dude is absolutely draining me. please and thank you!tl,dr- i’m 22f, never been in a relationship, and shy. a guy at work who’s about eight years older than me has been overtly flirting with me, for the past three days, despite us working together for about five months. he’s not being clear about his intentions and when i asked him if he means any of the flirting, he said he’ll let me “decipher it.” a day later, after he was hardcore flirting with me, he didn’t really talk to me or smile at me, so i wanted to see if a coworker had any incite, about the guy flirting with me. this coworker told me that he’s pretty sure he has a girlfriend and might just be joking with me. the thirty year old guy didn’t ask for my snap, number or anything, which i found weird. i think if he has a gf, he’s looking to cheat; if no gf i think it’s all just some cruel joke orchestrated by him. even though i’m really upset, i really want some closure and still want to see if he’s actually interested in me or not but don’t know how to go about it. thank you.",4,2,Need some advice about flirting/(relationship-ish?) stuff with a guy from work,Adult

3698,"i am a f19 (east asian and southeast asian) yesterday i found an opened pack of lube on my dad's night stand.so i found out that my dad was gay when i was 10. my parents would constantly fight and i eventually caught on to what was happening. my earliest memory of me finding out that my dad was gay was when i heard my mom yell at him for coming back home very late around 2 am and she would not let my dad in our apartment room. i didn't quite understand what was going on. i also remember this one time when i was 15 when my dad came back home from work late at night, and i was up and i tried to hear what was going on from the staircase. she was crying out about this dating website i guess, i'm not quite sure, which my dad was on. his username was ""something...chupadick"" (chupa dick in spanish means suck dick) (we travel to different countries a lot due to my dad's job, especially to spanish speaking countries which is why they know spanish).my mom started to get depressed and started sleeping for hours and hours. she has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and depression and she has been taking medication for a few years now.my mom has also thrown and broken my dad's phone twice because she found him texting guys.i've also overheard my dad talking to my mom about the fact that he does not want his family (his sisters, parents, etc) to know about his sexuality.i've found out that he was in a relationship with this one guy, let's name him ""tom"" i guess since i was 15? and i have been seeing him texting that guy for a long while now. just yesterday i saw him texting that same guy.my family (my mom, dad, and a younger brother who is 15) are about to move to another country for approximately 3-4 years due to my dad's job in december but i am staying here in my dad's country because i go to university here. i am very worried about how they are gonna be.currently, my dad and my mom are living in separate homes (they are not divorced). initially, we were all living in the same place but that was a problem for my dad because it was very far from his workplace, taking around 1.30-2 hours for him to reach there. however, it was convenient for my brother because that place was quite close to my brother's school, only taking 15 minutes to reach there. so i guess my dad prioritized my brother's comfort and decided to just have himself move out of the place and move to another place that is a lot closer to his workplace. now we only have one car so he wanted my mom to have the car so she could send my brother to school and go grocery shopping and all that. my dad would come back home every friday or saturday. i also live separate from them now that i go to uni, i am no longer living with my mom and my younger brother. but i would go back to see them every friday.so basically my mom is now spending most of her time with my 15-year-old brother who is addicted to video games. he does not really talk with us much. we used to be very close but he kind of stopped talking to me and he also doesn't really talk much with mom and dad. so my mom has also been upset with him cause he doesn't really talk to her. i am very worried about my mom. she still loves my dad even though she knows that he doesn't love the same.i just feel like my parents are not so compatible with each other.my dad's sleep schedule is pretty great. he wakes up early in the morning and tries to go bed early: my mom on the other hand sleeps all day most of the time and she would wake up at around 7 pm-8 pm when she's not feeling great and she would be active at night, watching tv and all which makes my dad a bit upset because he is not able to sleep cause of her going in and out the room, switching the lights on and off and having the tv playing.my dad is generally a calm person and he is also quite a logical, very simple guy, very collected: my mom, on the other hand, she's very silly, very sweet, she's quite childish in a sense where she talks and acts like a child sometimes, and she is also very emotional.anyways, so about yesterday, my mom, dad, and i went to his single room place to get things that we wanted for their trip to another country (i was just accompanying them and help them organize things). he had many boxes filled with our old books and toys and my mom was very happy to see them. she was very happy when she found her old books that she thought went missing. so while she was busy with that, i went to just chill on his bed but then i saw a condom looking packet on his nightstand. i was very shocked when i saw that. i kept thinking that was not possible, there's no way that's a condom package because first of all he is my dad, there's no way! second of all he is gay, right? i then picked it up while both my parents were turning their backs and i read the packet and it said ""water-based lube"". when i saw that it felt so numb but i just acted like i didn't see anything.do i hate my dad: i used to resent my dad so much when i was younger. we used to fight quite often because i was very stubborn and i used to think that he favored my younger more. but now i don't really resent him. i really appreciate how much he has done for us. he sent both my brother and i to private schools although we were low on money. he always prioritized us. i hate how he cheated on my mom and made my mom suffer so much. and still keeps cheating behind our backs. weirdly, when i see him texting guys, it doesn't really make me react. i don't know if it's because i am used to it but i would do anything for my mom to not see the texts. yesterday, when my mom was getting close to the nightstand in my dad's room, i stood in front of it so she wouldn't see it. i hate my dad for cheating and doing such things behind our backs and pretending like he didn't do anything.i can't stop thinking about it. the lube packet in his room. every time i think about it, it makes me cry and it makes me imagine what went down and how my mom would react if she saw it. it reminds me of all the times that my mom cried and their fights.i am very worried. i don't think my brother knows anything about what is going on. i don't have the guts to even tell him. i just really want my family to be happy. i dont know what to doi am very sorry about the fact that i didn't organize this well, i was just typing whatever went in my mind. also english is not my first language so i apologize if this doesn't make much sense/confusing)",12,73,"My gay dad and my depressed mom, what should I do",Adult

4162,"i saw a post here saying “does anyone else feel like they are running out of time to get their life together” and a lot of the comments were agreeing so i figured i’d make a guide on how to do that. basically you need two things to have a life that is “together” and make you be on equal footing as the other people who are your age instead of feeling like you are behind and playing catch up. the two things you need are a job that pays more than minimum wage, and a sex life. if you have those two things then you are caught up to everybody and your life is together. you aren’t playing catch up because you are already caught up. so for the job part you just need to have a degree in a useful field, if you already have that then you are already caught up in the job part. if you don’t have that then go back to college, once you are enrolled into a major that is useful then that is good enough you don’t even need the degree yet to feel like you are caught up as long as you are atleast enrolled and working towards it then that’s good enough as long as you don’t drop out and actually get the degree in the end. next is sex life. go and hit on people that you are attracted to in your college, outside, and at bars and clubs, and hopefully you will attract someone. there you have it, basically enroll in college into a useful degree, and hit on people that you are attracted to. do this then the problem of feeling behind and needing to catch up will go away because you are already caught up.",6,1,Guide on how to get your life together in your 20’s,Adult

(i paid for my phone, my car, i pay my fair portion of rent split between 4 of us, i pay for internet. yet, here i am. i've never held it above his head to get my way.)today, i learned that my father's upbeat and giddy attitude is a lack of emotional sympathy and not because hes a good person. always joking to the point that i'm screaming for him to stop because he jokes until he finds something that pisses me off.today i realized that my father lacks the ability to read the context of situations. he thinks the entire world is against him and blames us being 1-3 minutes late to our job every now and then on me and that it's why he cant get a promotion. today i realized that my father blames all of my.flaws on my mom because he lacks the ability to accept faulttoday i realized why my mother cheated on my father. i now see that the countless screaming matches that kept me up at night in high school were what drove her away from the marriage. today i realized that my father has manipulated me to choose him over my mother. because he blames her for the problems they've always had and wants some form of affirmation to himself. today i realized that i never spoke up about things that happened to me in school because my dad had beaten it into my mind that speaking up will start an arguement and that all my teachers thought i was lazy because of it. and when i stayed after school to get teacher help i stayed with the only teacher that was genuinely a bad person because she told me that i would never succeed and i was wasting my time bu staying after school and that this incident led me to beleive that my father was right. today i learned that my father is not who i want to be. i will be better than him and know the difference between teaching my kids something and punishing them. today, i learned that my father's actions have spoke louder than his words. i have put a lot of thought into everything that has happened in the last 3 years of my life. my father has always offered to help, but has only helped a handful of times when it was convenient to him. i realized that my eyes have been opened by the pc and reddit community that what has happened is not normal. i am now stuck in a situation where i have a brother who is extremely financially illiterate and my father's only way of helping him is to ""let things happen how they happen"" rather than show him the error of his ways. a situation where i feel it necessary to stay locked in my room just to avoid arguements with him. he refuses to ever take the calm approach to solving problems. and when i tell him hes yelling, he screams that hes not yelling. i make enough money to pay my current bills and cant afford to move out and the only person i trust to move in with has a gf and cant help. i just wish i had enough money to get away from my father. i want to move to texas where i wont know anyone. i can leave all this toxic family behind. i dont. want. to. be. here.....",0,1,Today I realized how bad of a person my father has been all my life.,Adult

4986,"big ass story you probably wont bother reading ahead but i feel the need to tell somebody about this so here ya go. so theres this girl i've known for a couple of years now. we met on a long bus ride away from uni toward our hometowns and instantly hit it off and spoke for 2 hours. let me start by saying she is drop dead gorgeous, to the point no one would ever think they had a chance with her. that being said i liked spending time with her for all the other reasons my other male friends didnt; i always felt like she was a good friend i could rely on for solid conversation, advice and a laugh. i only ever saw her as a friend, initially because like all my other mutual male friends, thought we had no chance. obviously theres still been physical attraction, i just shoved it away as i genuinely cared for the friendship we quickly developed and didnt want to be like 99% of other people in her life that gave her attention on account of her beauty. it's been around 2 years of being friends and just before we all left for summer this april, our friend group got together to have a bush party bonfire. her and i decided to smoke weed together which is a very occasional thing for the both of us. fairly soon after when we were speaking i just felt something in my gut that i hadn't in a long time, i had feelings for her that i never thought would come about, but nevertheless they were there. fast forward 2 and a half months to last week, dozens of mutual friends were all coming up to celebrate a birthday and enjoy the long weekend. i knew she was going to be there, and i knew i was going to find a way to tell her how i felt come hell or high water. i show up to the shindig a couple hours late as i was working, as soon as i got there she came to me to sign me up as her pong partner for the day long tournament (which we came 2nd). we got to spend a lot of time together on account of this. after this day party, people left to get food and changed and prepare to get together later for the evening. as i hadn't drank in a couple hours because i had driven, i volunteered to drive her and her roomate home, as i dropped them off they told me to come by later to eat and smoke. i returned soon after and her roomate was in the living room and told me she was upstairs in her room, so i go to get her. as i walked in she was in her bed, still in her bikini from earlier in the day and my brain almost overheated. we ended up talking for hours in there, her still having no idea how i felt. i steered the conversation to a crush i had and to see if she could guess who it was. eventually being able to say ""shes just my type"". she asked, ""what's your type?"" and i said, ""you."". she was pretty blown away, and said ""i always thought you were a great homie. i had no idea."" i said ""neither did i, it came out of nowhere at the bonfire"" we kept talking about it, and how neither of us are capable of having a boy/girlfriend because were both busy and focused on school and a number of other things, but still just like everyone else wanted a ""someone"". eventually the conversation changes but rejection nor acceptance were declared and i stayed hopeful telling her all i ask is her to have an open mind. as the night progressed we went to one of our friends houses, but it was boring so she offered to bring me to her other friends house where more mutuals were and i said sure. she quickly called me out playfully ""because you want to, or because i'm your crush?"" and i just played along laughing unsure of what i said. we get there and theres snacks and she starts hand feeding me which i thought was funny but no big deal. i started to fall tired as it had been a busy day with hours of partying on top of a shift at work for myself, i leaned sideways into the couch and she put her arm around me. this was a big deal as physical touch was never something we did. at all. so i'm just trying to play it cool but in my head i'm losing my shit. we eventually leave with her roomate who showed up at some point and i walked them home. they offered to let me crash as its late, to which i quickly accepted. they make popcorn and she starts feeding me again, after finishing it her roomate leaves to go to bed. her and i continue talking until she brings up sleep. i asked, ""so where exactly am i crashing?"" she said she was sleeping naked cause she didnt have pjs and its disgustingly hot so i'm gettin the couch. i joked i could go get some pjs from my place quickly cause i'm scared of being alone in the dark. she playfully said no again. i said alright and talked about how fun the day was and i wish i could keep going but i'm so tired, she said she agreed. there was a long, deafening silence after this. then our eyes met, and stayed locked. all i could think was now or never during that silence. i said ""fuck it"" aloud and she knew exactly what i meant, and literally jumped on me as i moved towards her to kiss and all the tension within us unleashed. before i knew it we were on the couch, with much less clothing and all i could think was ""holy shit this is not happening what in the goddamn fuck how am i here right now."" i'll spare you the details but uglies were bumped. afterwords, all i could hear in my head was a song that i hadn't heard or even thought of since who knows when - once in a lifetime by the talking heads(i dont even like 80s music). the next morning she had to go back home, and i spent the afternoon in my chair replaying the entire day in my head and that song on my speakers wondering; how did i get here? i have no clue what happens next or what to do. i'm as equally worried at the now completely changed friendship between us and what it means for that; as i am excited that i took a shot from 5 miles away that hit a bullseye. hopefully this post inspires someone out there to shoot their shot. i was fully expecting a no, but i would have rather heard that then never know her

5607,"#backtosnackfightsforacure streamwhat (and when and where)i will be doing this :1. hey guys! i am finally ready to announce my 200 follower special stream. we hit 200 followers 2 weeks ago and since then, i have planned something very special for it. i will be trying to raise $100 for “the michael j. fox foundation || for parkinson’s research”. 2. i will be doing a 12 hour charity stream raising money for “the michael j. fox foundation || for parkinson’s research” in honor of my father who has parkinson’s disease on april 18th (the saturday after easter) from 10am est to 10pm est athttps://twitch.tv/backtosnack 3. for most of the stream, i will be playing : the legend of zelda - breath of the wild : master mode (this just makes it harder and gives the enemy more health.)4. for part of the stream, i will be playing wii sports with my father. it will take place whenever my dad feels up to being on stream and isn’t too stiff. we will be playing and talking about how parkinson’s disease has affected his life.why i will be doing this :1. for my 100 followers special stream, i had a few friends over and just had a really good time. now, i have 200 followers. i am still a super small streamer, but i do feel like i do have a community at this point. there are regulars who watch the stream and a good amount of people know my stream. this has lead me to feel like i have enough followers to have a successful charity stream. i also held a spontaneous charity stream a few months back when i had 150 followers for “team trees” and i was able to raise $50. that stream was just out of no where with no build up or donation incentives. i feel that with 200 followers, build up and better pr about it, and donation incentives, i’ll be able to hold a successful stream and raise at least $100. 2. my dad, john, first went to the doctor about having parkinson’s symptoms when i was 2 years old. on the date of the stream, i will be turning 18 in a month. my dad was diagnosed with parkinson’s when i was 3 years old. i never got to know my dad before parkinson’s personally. i have been told stories about how lively and happy he was, how he’d do anything to cheer up my siblings, and was overall, an amazing guy. even with parkinson’s, my dad is my hero and my main inspiration, but it is just different from what my older siblings know of him before it all. every day, i have to help my dad doing simple daily tasks, from dressing, to eating, to even walking from one room to another. he has not driven in a few years and he doesn’t work anymore as well. i know he wishes he could do more, but it is coming to a point that people need to do things for him. even so, he still snowplows for single lady neighbors, who physically can’t themselves. i want to do this to give back to him for everything he has done for me and countless others. if i can do anything that would allow a kid like me, to at least be able to get to know his father before parkinson’s, i’d do everything i could to allow that to happen. that is one of the many reasons why i am doing this. as stated before, i will be raising money for “the michael j. fox foundation || for parkinson’s research”. my father has parkinson's so i thought it would be best if he was the one to choose the organization i  raised money for. i sat down with him and we watched a few parkinson charity's videos and he chose “the michael j. fox foundation || for parkinson’s research”. he especially liked how their website states, “the michael j. fox foundation is dedicated to finding a cure for parkinson's disease through an aggressively funded research agenda and to ensuring the development of improved therapies for those living with parkinson's today.”i am doing the charity stream on the 18th of april to allow for the most amount of people to be able to show up for the stream. i wouldn't want to do it easter weekend and then have nobody be able to show up and support the stream. that is also why i will be streaming for 12 hours. my timezone is est, but many of my viewers are in different timezones so this gives plenty of time for people to find a time that they can stop by and watch the stream, if they'd like. at first, i had a hard time figuring out what game i was going to play for 12 hours on stream. i couldn't decide so i headed over to r/parkinsons and asked them. they suggested that i stream the legend of zelda : breath of the wild. i am not just playing botw because it is an amazing game ( even though it is ), but because it has a meaning behind it. while i, a healthy teenager, can easily grasp the controls of botw, many people with parkinson's cannot. their disability doesn't allow them to easily hold a controller and focus on performing multiple button actions quickly or simultaneously. i am playing botw to show that most people with parkinson's are unable to play video games with ""complicated"" controls. i'd imagine that there are even people out there who are gamers that previously could play most video games just fine, but now they can't with parkinson's. i don't have memories of playing many video games with my father because he is unable to play along with me. this isn't exclusive to botw, but it is a good example of a game that many with parkinson's cannot play. i want to help people understand how this disease can affect many aspects of people’s lives, from big things like relationships, to much smaller things like gaming. i hope that my small act of playing botw, can help others understand how hard this disease can be on people.smaller reasons why i chose to play botw : i created a list of donation incentives for botw. i thought these might encourage some viewers to donate and create a fun stream atmosphere. i have not played master mode yet so i thought it would be even more fun to see me fail at master mode. playing on master mode would also mean that i’d start a new game, which works well with the donation incentives. botw is my favorite game of all time so i wouldn’t get bored of playing it for 12 hours or so. there is just so much to do in it as well, that if i did get bored of 1 section of the game, i could venture off somewhere else. 4. the few video game memories i do have with my dad are mostly memories of playing wii sports with him. as many of you know, wii sports is not complicated at all. there is only one action you really have to do which is swing the wii mote. i asked my dad if he’d be up to streaming wii sports bowling and golf (his 2 favorite sports from wii sports) with me. i also asked him if he’d be willing to talk about his experience with parkinson’s and how it has affected his life. he said that he is okay with both of those things. this will probably take place at 12pm, or just whenever my dad is feeling up to it. how you can help! : all proceeds of the stream will go towards “the michael j. fox foundation || for parkinson’s research”. all bits, subs, gifted subs, (all tier 1 subs count as $2.50 as twitch takes half) ads, and donation will go towards supporting “the michael j. fox foundation || for parkinson’s research”. you can donate directly by either buying bits and submitting them in chat, or donating through my streamlabs donation link,https://streamlabs.com/backtosnack or if you don’t trust that i will donate the money, you can donate directly to the cause i am raising for at https://www.michaeljfox.org/donate if you don’t trust me, on my instagram and twitter (@backtosnack), i have a post showing my donation to team trees, which was all from money raised on stream. if you want to help, but don’t have cash to, you can subscribe with twitch prime. if you have an amazon prime account and link it to your twitch account, you get twitch prime for free. with twitch prime, you get a free tier 1 twitch prime subscription. if you don’t know how to do this, here is twitch’s guide on doing this. it is very simple. https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-link-your-amazon-accountwatch ads to receive bits on pc. bits is twitch’s cryptocurrency. every bit is equal to 1 penny. 100 bits is 1 dollar and so on. in the bottom right corner of chat, there is a smiley face and a diamond. once you click on that diamond on pc or mac, a purchase bits box will pop up. on the top of it, there is a watch ads to receive bits

friends!! this one would honestly help a ton! just sharing the announcement to your friends and family would mean a lot to me. plus, the more people who watch, the more ads will be shown before the stream, which will earn the charity even more money! here is the donation incentives for the stream! : dono incentivessingular dono amounts : any dono or collection of donos from 1 person that is $10
