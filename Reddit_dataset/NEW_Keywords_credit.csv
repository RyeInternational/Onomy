We learned quite a bit about these cards, but several things we learned apply to all credit cards (if there are any cards this doesn't apply to, I'm unaware of what they are). **Processing payments:**So the first thing I will cover is how payments get processed when using a credit card as payment, as this will be referenced later.Payments happen in three steps when you use a credit card1. This is when the merchant (or their system) finalizes any credit transactions for the day, which typically happens after the store is closed, which is why it usually happens in the middle of the night.",0,1,[101] Some (generally) unknown things that happen with (most) credit cards.,Adult

123,"You will lose a small amount of money paying interest, but in exchange you will gain a better credit score which is a HUGE boost in this economy. )Having a higher credit score will give you more loan availability, credit limits (will go into more later), lower interest and greater flexibility in payback.LOANSIt’s beneficial to already have a banking account (with direct deposit) set up. If you haven’t yet, I would pick a Credit Union because they are more locally invested, often give you higher interest on return, and less charged interest on loans and credit cards.Loans must have minimum amount due paid on date due, this contributes to your credit score and is a major player in how lending establishments view your likelihood to pay back money owed. It is essential that if you do the signature loan, you make these installments in this fashion or you will start your credit score off on a bad foot which is harder to recover.CREDIT CARDSDo not - I repeat - DO NOT use credit cards to float your lifestyle. Use them to build your credit by using for gas or groceries. Allow the amount due to hit the billing period, pay off bill in full.In major financial emergencies, you can use a loan (if you have the ability) or credit cards to cover you. Use at least $300 toward your credit card bill on first statement, pay more than the minimum amount due, pay it off as soon as possible. Banks use the interest they charge you as their profit.I’ll pop back in later and review some basic credit information as well!",0,1,Can you spot me? (LOANS!),Adult

(Edited for clarity: she told me I'm only to use my credit card for emergencies with like $200 on it, but to me you could just use a savings account right? )I know some of the history of how credit cards started and essentially what they do, but to me it just doesn't add up to being a good investment for me? I don't enjoy spending money, and the idea of going into debt just to show im really hood at not being in debt seems a little ridiculous to me.I've seen some older adults on here who say they never even touched a credit card, so it should be possible, right?

I’ve had a phone contract for a good few years and started paying car insurance etc 2 years ago (I’ve been told they give you a credit history, yes? ), and even though my mum’s always said “Never get a credit card!” I figured the extra boost wouldn’t hurt. I’m typically pretty good with money so haven’t had to use it very much, despite the fact the company gave me quite a bit of credit to play with 😅  I’ve kept a pretty small balance (don’t think I’ve ever owed more than 25%) on the card for the year to keep the card “active”, occasionally paying off larger purchases immediately and always paying more than the minimum monthly payment.The main pro of this particular card was the introductory rate of 0% interest, but that will be changing in roughly 3 weeks time, and I’m wondering what move to make.On the one hand, close the card, but I believe that will negatively affect my credit score in some way? Sorry if I’m dumb haha) or is it fine to just keep the card and not use it unless for an emergency?Frankly I just don’t want to be paying out more than I need to, and with my credit score being in the Excellent category on Experian now, I’m not concerned about getting that little boost anymore, but I also don’t want it to go down 😅Thanks for reading",1,1,Credit Score advice,Adult

A break-up would make the return on their investments uncertain, with the timeline for an IPO that was due in November now pushed into the distant future.The government could ask Ant to spin off its more lucrative operations in wealth management, credit lending and insurance, offloading them into a financial holding company that will face tougher scrutiny.“The emerging reality is China’s regulators are adopting similar regulation toward banks and fintech players,” said Michael Norris, research and strategy manager at Shanghai-based consultancy AgencyChina.Ant’s payments business alone leaves much less to the imagination. To make money, they leveraged the payments services to cross sell products including wealth management and credit lending.“Ant’s growth potential will be capped with the focus back onto its payments services,” said Chen Shujin, a Hong Kong-based head of China financial research at Jefferies Financial Group Inc. “On the mainland, the online payments industry is saturated and Ant’s market share pretty much reached its limit.”**Nightmare**The worst case scenario would be for Ant to forgo its money management, credit and insurance businesses, halting its operations in the units that service half a billion people.Its wealth management business which includes the Yu’ebao platform that sells mutual funds and money market funds, accounted for 15% of revenue.Credit tech, which includes Ant’s Huabei and Jiebei units, was the biggest revenue driver for the group, contributing 39% of the total in the first six months this year.",15,1,Ant Turning From Windfall to Nightmare for Its Global Investors,Finance

So... My AGI is a few thousand over the limit for earning the saver's credit. I made too much to earn the saver's credit, which is essentially a free $200. And this will likely be the last year I can earn it.So my thinking is that I would make a contribution of approximately $2,000-2,500 to my traditional IRA with after-tax dollars, deduct that on my taxes so that I would meet the AGI limit for the saver's credit, and then convert the monies to my Roth IRA.

Is it even possible?I forgot about the credit card debt that was disputed and removed, and tried applying for a different card from the same company a while back, but was basically told that until I pay what I owe, I can't get another card from them. The card I had was unsecured, and no annual fee, and I managed to get it when my credit was worse than it is now. I'm just not sure if it looks better on my report to have an unsecured card with a higher credit limit, than a secured one with a lower limit. I mean, a similar opportunity could present itself depending on what my credit looks like after paying off debts, or maybe my options will remain the same.

I was thinking that I would just have my Spotify subscription bill the card each month, which is $4.99 + tax.My concern is that I would only be using about 3% of my available credit at most, and I almost can't believe that proving that I can pay $5 per month would really get me a decent credit score compared to other people who probably spend hundreds, if not thousands of dollars each month.Am I on the right track here, and will I really have a good credit rating in a year's time if I just pay that off each month?",12,1,"If I use less than 3% of my available credit, will my credit score still go up?

For the past 4 years I've been a Dave Ramsey follower and I rejected the credit score for the past 3. Here is why that totally works, and how I've been able to not only navigate life but build wealth and prosper despite having legit zero credit. I didn't want to write this but someone in r/DaveRamsey suggested it so here we go.First lets ask what a credit score is. It is a mysterious and unknown set of guidelines set by 3 credit agencies. Well I don't think so since you can have a ton of cash , in reserves, and have zero credit. However, any discussion of what a credit score most likely is should also tlak about what it is not. You can do that and not have a credit score. You can do THAT without a credit score. And you can do THAT without a credit score. hmmmm hmmmmLet's address some common misconceptions  about the credit score that don't involve debt. Dollar Car rental and Turo explicitely don't need credit scores or credit cards. There is actually a thing called an insurance score (you can get it if you use credit karma but I don't endorse them because they are scummy). Ask yourself, what exactly about the process of using a credit card or taking on debt has any bearing of you to crash a car, have health problems, or have problems with your house? This isn't about your credit score but rather your ability to be under financial duress. Like other arguments present, a credit score is not a measure of your financial savvyness, trust worthiness, or discipline. I noticed that credit use, debt use, and actually caring about your credit score changes your behaviour. By avoiding credit scores you avoid credit. ***Why is everyone telling me to get a credit score? When they suggest you get a score, they  are also introspecting inward and justifying their own use of credit. This is mostly why I don't use credit scores, debt, credit card, or anything of the like.",61,1,Why I don't have a credit score,Finance

They said I could get the loan with a co-signer but I do not have a co-signer.This was my first time trying to get an auto loan and join a credit union and I didn't know every one of them had such different rules on auto loans for my situation. But fortunately, this credit union is giving me a chance to explain myself instead of denying me immidiately. I will call them tomorrow to explain everything and hope for the best I get approved.In the meantime, I have a disaster plan in mind which I might have to execute if I do not get approved for membership for this last credit union. Remember that one credit union that I said would work with my conditions but requires me to be a member for 6 months to do of state loans? They approved membership so now I'm in a credit union, who originally offered 2.6%, and can take up my loan from Bank of America after 6 months.",3,1,"I'm having trouble getting an auto loan from a credit union, should I take the high interest loan from my bank and refinance later?",Finance

The thing is, being able to consolidate or refinance these credit card debts would make a HUGE difference. I have just under $20k of credit card debt I'd love to consolidate somehow. I've spoken with a ton of banks and credit unions, and tell them my wages and debts, and my credit score (about 650-660, depending on the type of score), and the loan agent can usually give me a quote.

At this point, I'm seriously considering tanking my credit and not paying it until they force-close the account and try to settle the debt. I likely won't need to apply for a new lease for a year and a half, I do not want to open anymore credit cards, and if/when my car dies, I have no intention of trying to get a new one.",0,1,Should I intentionally tank my credit?,Finance

Since today is the 20th, it has been almost 3 weeks, and it is just a matter of time before it shows up on my credit report.2. The collections agency has discretion as to when to report it to the credit bureau and they're waiting to work something out with me before reporting it (although as far as I can tell, they have not been trying to contact me).3. This will never negatively impact my credit score because of the nature of the account as a corporate credit card. After all, I was unable to make timely payments when the account was still with the credit card company and it never impacted my credit score and so for the same reason, the balance having gone to collections will not negatively impact it.I intend on calling the collections agency tomorrow, but before I do, I was hoping the reddit community could give me a clearer idea of what is happening.",14,1,"Laid off from job in April.

As of now, its been about 75 days since my debt was sold to the credit agency. **Is it possible to agree to pay in full but to a lesser amount than the original balance, so that I can resolve this debt within the 180 day period, avoid credit reporting, and prevent the difference being further sold to another company? For settling, it seems like the CA acknowledges that the actual debt is X but agrees to let you pay a lesser amount but indicates on your credit report something like ""settled for less than full balance."" The other option is to get a discount, which goes something like the CA disregards X and re-establishes the full balance as something less than X, which you agree to pay that discounted amount in full, and they indicate on your credit report something like ""balance paid in full.""",3,1,Small medical debt within 180 day waiting period,Finance

Eventually, I will remove myself as an authorized user so that I can independently manage my finances.My question is if I were to remove myself as an authorized user now, does my credit score just go to zero (because it's my only active line of credit)? If this is the case, I would definitely consider getting a Discover it Student card to start independently building my credit score.If it's not the case, should I just wait until I graduate with a full-time job and start trying to build the Chase Trifecta?

23865,"Hi all,My fiancé and I are trying to make a decision if we should refinance our auto loans into one joint credit card. We have a joint account at the local credit union for paying off rent and other home expenses. When setting up the account, they offered us at a rate of 1.49% lifetime if we were to refinance both of our auto loans into one credit card. So if we refinance to one credit card it'll be like $20,000 balance @ 1.49%. Below is info of our current auto loans and credit score:  Me: $11,000 @ 3.64%. 780 credit score. 720 credit score. Also, another reason is that we believe we will have a joint credit card in the future anyways to equally share the expenses for rent/mortgage, home stuff, or basically anything we would buy together. One big con this might be a bad decision is that opening another credit card line may negatively affect my Fiance's credit score greatly.

I figured someone might be interested in what the actual outcome was.Prior to doing this I rounded out what I had. Under my name 12 credit cards, approximately $2000 on a no interest deal on an OLED TV and a few thousand left on a car loan (my wife and I had both signed on it).Most of those credit cards were mine alone acquired when I was in college or shortly after high school, only two were more recent one being for the OLED TV deal.My wife had the car loan, but she only had 3 independents a Discover and two store cards mainly for whatever deals they were offering at the time.So once the payoff hit the credit reports my score went up 20 points. The best I can guess is outside the mortgage her longest credit card was the Discover. The car loan and store cards were much newer and of substantially less value.So I guess there really isn’t a clear cut answer as to what this does to your credit, like anything else it seems to depend on your length of credit and available credit.

In the section answering the question ""Should I pay off my credit card before the billing cycle ends? If you pay your current balance in full *before* the billing cycle ends and the statement is generated, no balance will be reported to the credit agencies.If you pay the statement balance in full every month once a month, after the statement is generated, the balance will be reported to the credit agencies but you will not be charged interest since the payment was made within the grace period (assuming you paid the previous month's statement balance in full).There are rare circumstances when you might want to pay down your credit card *during* the month. If you have accumulated credit card debt and are not able to pay the full statement balance, you should make your payment as soon as the money is available in order to reduce your total balance and save money on interest. You may also need to pay your credit card down before the statement is generated to clear credit space or to lower your utilization, which is calculated based on the statement balance reported to the credit agencies, in anticipation of applying for a loan in the following two months. ""Does this mean that there is a small window of time I should be paying off my credit card balance; after the statement has been generated but before the grace period is up? As a background, I have been raised that if I just treat my credit card as a debit card (I.e. pay it off immediately in the app the next day) I will still build credit but not create credit card debt.

In anticipation of my graduation, during my final year of law school I read “The Only Investment Guide You Will Ever Need,” and followed its advice to build my credit. I.e., I got (my first) credit card (a Discover Card w/ a $2,000 line of credit) and spent $400 on it every month, paying the full balance off every month. After a few months, Discover gratuitously increased the line of credit available on the card to $5,000 (the book didn’t mention this possibility, but I didn’t sweat it). The book’s advice was to open a second card after a year and begin doing the same thing with it (spending 20% of the credit every month and paying it off in full at the end of the month). Maybe I was just a bit dim witted from the move and starting at the new office and all, but I only realized halfway through the transaction that the financing would come in the form of a Best Buy credit card (approved for up to $4,000 in credit). It is most important to me to be responsible and protect my credit (it’s treated me very well to do so in this relatively short time!). It is also nice to live in financial comfort, but I am willing to sacrifice that in the short term in favor of responsibility and good credit, if at all necessary!I have included all information that I can foresee as being relevant to this discussion. TLDR — I’ve built my credit up over the past year by following conventional wisdom. However, I opened a Best Buy credit card last month (approved for up to $4000 in credit) to put a $1000 TV on (interest free for two years).
