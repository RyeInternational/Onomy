42,"skim if you want but this includes info about my mother me and situation to help get me the best advice for when i'm eighteeni'm not signing away almost anything medical and nothing financial ik when i'm eighteen they no longer have any say over my behavior i'm looking for ideas and or what to do or advicei may declare going homeless if i have to. if it hit rock bottom i'm okay with sugar moms and dads or stripping or whatever i need to make it i say thing information to help others better give advice----------------------------------------------------------------------------------background:my parents are divorced and both have been very abusive in their own way.a my mother has full costody and i will probably review no money from my disabled father who is in the clutches of his family that's probably liquidating his assets. my mother has been reported to dcf before and i've tried to get help with my situation before, but considering i have my own problems, and i showed no signs of bruising from times she's hit me, and i haven't shown anyone the unconsented video footage of her vocal emotional abuse dcf did not remove me***. she ""saves"" my pay checks because she doesn't let me have them. and i pay some bills because we're low income. i need to leave because i'm tired of having the environment on mesome rules of hers include: -no sleeping over girl friends houses even though i have when i was younger-no hanging out with guys unless you're in a group setting and must be even mix gender or mostly female-no hanging out with taken guys in relationships-no hanging out with guys if you're in a relationship (i'm only allowed straight relationships. if i came out as pan she would disown me and send me to the hospital she thinks being not straight is a mental problem)-no being out after 9 but really your curfew is 8:30-no friends even if they're off their jol cannot drive you it must be my mom or another trusted adult of a friend's parent-------------------------------------------------------------my mom herself:racist- has been toward me because i'm chinese and she's italian. she adopted me and has said racist things toward me as well as thinking theres problems with every race that's not hire or anyone of color that's not a doctor or lawyersexist- until she learned females can make money in science fields she didn't want me doing anything like it. she made me not take woodshop for example because she was also afraid of the guysshe also doesn't think having friends that aren't females is dlwrkng and not possiblelgbtq+ phobic- anyone that's not cis gendered and straight to her she thinks has some medical issue like it's a disability and a mental health problem and needs to be punished. (i'm pansexual and questioning if i'm agender or genderqueer)other prejudices--thinking people can reade her mind-any one in customer service is stupid/ she can be rude and expect they'll still be nice-everyone wants the best for her-shell do good for you and expect she can treat you like shit later but it's okay because she did something for you that you never needed or asked for (i get it's nice but ie: buying say a coffee and then saying something like im a burden in her life)other problems:-thinking i make her yell and get angry and upset when she does it to herself because she's very opinionated and i don't have control over say the guy pumping our gas or that i say forgot something that was her responsibility like not missing a gas station she passes while driving -she is financially abusive because i can't even keep ahold of my own money without her threatening me in the way of say not letting me see my friends**i need to see my friends because i need a break from being at home. i've gotten so depressed from not seeing them before they've become one of the only things that keeps me afloat abuse-verbally abusive and things she says is scary: ""all liars should die"" ""when you and (her bf) are sick next i'll fucking 'chicken soup you' and then you'll croak"" ""do you blow your bf with that mouth"" ""you're a fucking whore"" (i broke up with one bf and four months later found someone else i wanted to date) that also ties into  emotional abuse- she guilt trips me all the time and says she can do things because she's an adult even if it's ridiculous- physical abuse: she says away from this because she's been physically beaten belt style when young but she has still whipped a belt at me before, grabbed me, pulled my hair, slapped me with a metal ruler and threatened me in various ways including to crash a car while we're in it. nothing has been enough to leave a scar and mostly just to sting and be red for a bit ---also physically abusive to my things like destroying a 150$ tablet that was my last christmas gift from my father who is too disabled to know what time of day it is or what 1 plus 1 isdestroyed a government provided trac phone (bc low income)destroyed another phone (150$) that was a gift to me *** i can't have any privacy she if she wants to needs to be able to read through my texts and i can't have social media without her knowing (so she doesn't know about this account) because she'd want me to explain everything but do the adult thing where she doesn't actually listen and expect me to keep answering the same question. she'd question why i post anything or who people are and want to control everything - parenting is basically from the 50's like anything that happens in the house stays in the house (even if you want to kill yourself which i have because if this environment)- therapy is for insane people- mental health doesn't exist you're either okay and sane or you have a illegal problem that needs to be locked up (but it's okay for her to have anxiety which no one can say she has just her or shell tell at you)-bizzare weird things that just make me uncomfortable: she think she can just into the bathroom when i'm taking a piss or a shower even if i'm naked and want privacy -she will go to the bathroom if i'm say washing my face even though we have a second one -she keep telling at me to get out if the bathroom because she needs to go even if i do even though we have a second one-shell just be naked like say after a shower and say i'm in the bathroom doing something even though it's not a sight i want to see without warning-she pushes her way into all my doctors and everything appointments and doesn't understand no matter how many times people tell her what patients rights are and i have to have my doctors and what not just straight up lie to her it's that badi've sprinkled examples of her weirdness and how she's abusive and controlling and unsupportive.-------------------------------------------------------------***some things about me:i have depression and anxiety that have been clinical and even lead me to emergency services and therapy. i have indulged in self harm and binge drinking as a suicide attemptthis ties into why dcf didn't remove me because they couldn't see past the cutting and drinking even though i'd tell them why. this isn't all my problems but it strongly ties into my concerns and why i posted this:because of my legal history for stealing from my house and consumption of alcohol and past mental health outburst (going on 4 years ago) does this affect when i turn eighteen to go and not had my parents know anything. i plan on not signing anyway medial rights besides if i'm not able to give consent to medical procedures if i say get in a car crash and need surgery but can't respond. i won't give them financial power either. i need to know what i should do when i'm eighteen like how to get medical insurancei only work part time and make massachusetts minimum wage for 12 hours with a week's pay of 149$i do not have my lisence just a permitobviously no cari don't want to burden my friends parents too much even though i might stay with someone for a bit.--she would literally call all my friends and their parents and the police department when i'm eighteen as if they could do something about getting me back in the housei'm currently 17 turning eighteen in june just after high school graduationplanning on going to college for four yearsi'm mentally stable now despite my disordersi need to get out of my house if possible on the day i'm eighteensome complications include: -not having a car or licence-not having a lot of money -no siblings -no family to take me in-going to college soon-place to live/storage-i am adopted and the most official document i have is going to be my passport coming in. we had to give up my permanent resident card to give the okay that i'm actually a citizen (american parents adopting foreign children on touch her down of the plane in america = usa citizen but we had no official document )(i'd need to steal all my papers that i don't know where all of them are in the house)-when i leave if i don't take my pocessions insecret i might get physically asulted",7,1,"I need help when I'm eighteen (""running away"")",Adult

64,"**how to find a rental:****drive around**: drive around the area and look for signs or complexes. find places that look well kept. drive by at night, on a weekend. is it loud? crazy activity. young people? old people?  **internet**: great way to look at a lot of places. but there are a lot (a lot) of scams out there. so be careful. do not give anyone money if you cannot look at the place first.**friends**: best way to go. ask friends. they may have a room or know someone or a good complex. **college bulletin boards**: people post rooms for rent there. assuming you are in college, you are getting people in roughly the same situation you are. but make sure you can stand living with the person (people) before agreeing. **scams**: if you hear any of the following, it is likely a scam. “i will mail you the keys”“i am out of the country right now”“i will send you a check…”**what to look for/ask when renting a unit/home:**how will rent be paidwhat is the deposit, application fee, background check fee, first/last months rent neededwho/how to handle emergencieswho pays what utilitieslook for existing damage. is the place well cared for or a hot mess?look for damage to doors and windows. that might be a sign of crime. **crime**: you can generally find crime states for areas online. google and see what you can find. look for property damage and drug arrests. both can be a bad sign. **looking to rent with friends**: figure things out ahead of time. sign a roommate agreement. it will make things easier. you can google roommate agreement. you can change what you need to change. just make sure that it makes sense to anyone not involved.  because a judge needs to be able to understand it, because if it goes to court, that is who has to understand it. know that if your buddy doesnt pay his part of the rent, you will be responsible if you both signed one lease. **renters insurance**: get renters insurance. it is cheap (generally under $20 a month). and will cover a lot of damages to your stuff in case of a fire or flood (have them go over what is covered). insurance can also sometimes cover your things while moving.

73,"**budgeting** you need a line item on your budget for food. you should also have a second line item for eating out if possible. personally: for a single young person with normal health $100 should be enough. but you have to shop smart. keep track of what you are actually spending. keep your receipts. at the end of the month, add it up and make sure you are working within your budget. if it is an ongoing problem of going over, then re-work your budget. **shopping**check the ads. build your grocery list off of what is one sale. find easy meals you like and will eat, over and over. buying in bulk is cheaper. learn to freeze your food correctly. use actual freezer bags and push all the air out of them. write on it what it is and when you froze it. anything over 6 months: chuck it. google what you can and cannot freeze (shrimp is a no). buy things that are not expensive and make more than one meal. rice, eggs, potatoes. all cheap in bulk. i loved rice with an over easy  egg and soy sauce. it was a great meal. coupons are great but take time to find, go through, make sure you have with you. personally, i think they are more work than they are worth in a lot of areas. but sometimes you get awesome ones at the store at check out. so check those ones. **meal preping**having meals ready and planned before you are hungry is helpful and keeps you from impulse eating at fast food. time is precious. a crock pot is awesome. easy to use and food ready when you are home at the end of the day. it is also good for making a large amount of food to freeze for later. simple cheap recipes for the crock pot: bbq meat: 1 pork or beef roast. get something cheap. cut off large fat sections. don’t cut the meat up. leave it as a big hunk. chopped up onion on the bottom (i like large strips), half a bottle of bbq sauce. done! low for 8 hours. shred it. freeze your extra. chicken taco meat: chicken breast – boneless skinless. half a thing of salsa. pack of taco seasoning. any other veggies you want to add. can or two of beans if you like.  8 hours on low. shred. tortilla and whatever else you have. if you want to: drain the liquid out as much as you can, roll in a tortilla with cheese. wrap in microwave save wax paper or plastic wrap. freeze. boom, easy cheap frozen burritos on the go. i like budgetbytes.com for cheap recipes with good directions. **snacking**while i was in college, i didn’t budget in food. just had my set expenses and everything left over was food and fun. until i over drafted my account into oblivion. i was buying my food at the college convenience store. which was the worst thing i could have done and here is why. the snack foods are so overpriced. you are paying for convenience of it being there and the impulse of wanting it when you are hungry. planning ahead can save you a ton of money. buy soda and take it with you. buy a good water bottle and fill it at home. buy large packs of snacks:a pack of cookies: $3 for 30 cookies. gas station/school store: $1.50 for 6. a pack of snack chips: $6 for 20. so $.30 each. at the gas station/school store. $1. so, buy your snacks at the grocery store and just pack them with you every time you head out. tons of money savings. **tldr: budget for food. buy things on sale. make food at home. buy snack food and take them with you.** ",3,7,Guide to grocery buying/budgeting,Adult

(even an hour is a good amount of time) do it. had i taken time i wouldn’t have spent a year wasting time and money or being depressed for 3 years as opposed to mediocre for 3 years. now let’s talk financially and how important financial literacy isso this started last year where towards the end of the school year i could only pay off part of credit card bill. all through september i knew i would need to work (at my dads factory) during the school year (not a fan of it, as we learned when i dropped grade 11 u math). so first semester goes by with me saying (everything will work out in the end. it always does). ya it never does. come winter break where i had to work 2 full weeks of my 4 week break and spent another week for surgery (fuck groin hernia). what was suppose to be a delightful relaxing break turned into the start of hell for me (thanks gambling problem). and it became worse as i replaced and spent $1300 (that i didn’t have and charged in to my credit card bill that will be due in feb). so now i have the amazing opportunity to work 24 hours at my dads place (every week in jan then 16 every week starting in feb until the end of march) and with this work, i also get to do an unpaid 250 hour internship for school this semester (another 20 hours a week at a ski hill) then you get to factor in annoying group work and class. oh what fun hell is. so the importance of financial decision is (at least for me) just because you can spend money on something you think you want (for me it was micro transactions is video games) doesn’t mean you should. 100% you are better off waiting some time to decide it it’s the best idea. so the importance of decision making. take time to consider the positive of decision of the choices. whatever choice you make will have an impact on your life, mostly likely one of the choices will be more negative than the other choice. as for the importance of owning your mistakes. it’s much better to be up front and honest and admit your mistake than you wait until it is forced out. you will save everyone involved time (and money)feel free to add the time i completely destroyed a great friendship of mine over jealousy on here to my list of regrets (i have). it started after my baseball game and she texted me about her new boyfriend (me being impulsive and irrational) replied with an offensive term (slut)! she got mad told me not to talk to her again. i waited a week. her still being mad i dug the whole even deeper by being a huge not ok douche (i lied about being terminally ill) which work until i felt bad and came clean a week later. making a small hole a larger hole. then i did more stuff such as harass her (luckily she never pressed charges. thank god!) and make this now large hole into a fucking colossal pit. (btw this was when i was in grade 10, i’m now 4 year of college or 22 in 2019). i message her last year as i do every quarter to try and make admen’s she responded with “me being a complete psychopath and lying to her about everything. so if we chalk that friend situation on the decision making board. waiting after my ball game before deciding how to respond to her texting me about her new bf would have definitely saved our friendship instead i made my decision immediately and have been paying the consequences of it ever since",0,1,The value of making decision and not being afraid to own up to mistakes,Adult

316,"hi y'all, i couldn't think of a better subreddit to turn to about this than r/adulting so hopefully this is okay, haha;; this is kind of a long post so i'm sorry, it just requires some back story.so i'm 22, with a boyfriend of 2.5 years, i have recently decided to go back to college to get my aa (and eventually my ba, but i'm going to community college to start), i'm working on getting a job that will work with my school schedule, and...... i'm the youngest of three siblings so my mom has decided to baby the living hell out of me for years. my boyfriend and i live in the bottom part of her tri level home, rent free. my mom pays for my health insurance, car insurance, and gas, i take care of our phone bill, my credit cards (been working on building my credit the past couple years with no problems), mostly i take care of our food, outings, etc. so while i'm not too worried about eventually taking on the big bills, here's where things get dicey. i wouldn't exactly call my mom an alcoholic, but i know whenever she drinks (which happens in phases, she may drop it for a week or two then start again full force) she picks fights with me. the other night it happened again. i went upstairs to show her something cute i bought and somehow it blew up into this massive thing about, somehow, my boyfriend. but the subject is beside the point here, the point is that i'm sick of being afraid of my mother and her drinking. this last time i stood up for myself after being diplomatic didnt work and honestly, i was fully expecting to get slapped or even kicked out. i'm so tired of this endless cycle of her drinking, fighting, then sucking up to the point i'm ready to move out. my siblings have told me to move out since i turned 18 but i've been financially under my moms thumb.i'm scared for my mental health and well being as well as the security in my place to stay. i have issues with my brainbits that make it hard for me to function sometimes, i know depression and anxiety are a component but in the coming months i'm going to seek treatment and get diagnosed. i've attempted suicide before and while i'm not looking for a way out but instead a way out of my parent's (thankfully that's the difference this time versus other times shes pulled stunts like this), i have a bit of another issue with just getting an apartment and moving tf out.after high school i got a dog to be my unofficial esa. his name is kodiak and he is the dumbest, sweetest creature on the face of the earth. hes half rottweiler/half goldendoodle. hes been an amazing emotional support animal, and once i seek treatment i plan on getting him fully established as my esa from my therapist. but hes an ""aggressive breed"" which blacklists us from 95% of apartments around us. in addition, my boyfriend has a german shepherd of equally good nature. i've heard you can get two dogs registered as esas under one name and it removes the ability to discriminate on breed and weight, and while i have no problem vouching that the pup has helped me (i paid for her anyway, shes my boyfriend's in name only), i just don't know what power landlords can have when it comes to esas and the ability to find housing.my goal is to move out by the end of the year, but my boyfriend thinks we should stay until i've gotten my associates. while i've dealt with my moms possible alcoholism for years, my desire for autonomy is really clashing. while i'm sure i could keep things copacetic enough to be able to stay until then, i really dont want to. i'd rather slowly work on my associates but be free (or face it full force head on while we look for places, then slow down).honestly, r/adulting, i just need some advice here.a) given the backstory, is moving out wise? i cant change my mom, she refuses to believe alcohol has any affect on her and instead it's all my fault, so there's really no changing her behavior. shes 63 and stubborn as a mule. my siblings have no leverage here either. so it's either move out or suck it up till i graduate, which should i do? b) if we decide to move out, what do i do with my dogs? get both registered as esas? does that even help?c) call me scum of society if you want, but i fully plan on utilizing food stamps and my college's support systems for poor students if we need it. are there any other reliable programs to help support us if we need them? i honestly dont know what's out there besides food stamps, if there even is anything out there besides food stamps lolsorry for the long post, but any help is super appreciated.",4,1,22 y/o facing issues with finding housing,Adult

619,"i’m 22 and just moved back home a month ago after completing my bachelors. i just got a job at a hospital in my state and i’m just waiting for the paperwork to process, so in the meantime i’ve just been home doing nothing really. my mom and i agreed that i would give her $100 every two weeks for groceries and that’s my contribution to the house. i can’t take it anymore in this house, and it’s only been a month. i love my parents dearly, they’ve always helped me out and supported me but they’re traditional people. they’re much older so i know their mindsets won’t change, but my parents are the type of people that make it about themselves. if i do something they don’t like/approve of then it’s always a matter of me not putting their feelings into consideration. i’m sick of having to think about others when it comes to my life and my decisions. i feel like i’m 17 again.i want out. unfortunately, i did not save up enough money to be able to move out right away so it’s gonna take a while. my boyfriend and i are planning on moving out of our places by the end of this summer and getting our own place together, but i know my parents would throw a huge fit. again, i know for a fact they’re gonna be like “you’re not supposed to move in with your so until you’re married” and all that jazz. he and i agreed that before we make any further big moves such as engagement we need to see how we live together. funny thing is, he and i have been together for a year and a half and my mom still has yet to meet him and my dad doesn’t know because my mom told me not to tell him while i was in school. old school “boyfriends just wanna have sex and get you pregnant and make you leave school” thoughts from my mom, so that’s why she told me not to tell him. i never ever ever had the boyfriend conversation with my dad so i don’t even know how to tell him or how he will react. my mom even told me that the day i do tell him, i have to act like my mom doesn’t know so i need to tell them both simultaneously. it’s annoying.so it feels like in order for me to take control of my life and do what i want, i’m gonna have to lie and say a friend is gonna move in with me so i don’t have to deal with the drama. my mom especially is the type to tell every single person in the family when something happens, so everybody is gonna know my business and i don’t want that. but then having to keep up with that lie is gonna be frustrating, but then telling them my boyfriend and i are gonna live together is gonna raise hell. i feel so trapped.  it’s extra frustrating because my mom also thinks that 22 is way too young to live on your own, that after college you’re supposed to stay with your parents. she just has these set ideas in her head that do not align with mine and i don’t want to argue or fight with her. i just don’t know what to do. of course once i start working i’m gonna be saving like crazy but it’s just discouraging feeling like this. that my parents think they still control me or own me, and me defending myself is me defying them. i’m the baby of 8 kids (5 are from my dad) so i do understand part of it is that it’s gonna be tough to let go of their last child but at the same time damn, it was gonna happen one day anyway. i just wish i could make my own decisions freely. help :(",6,1,"I want to move out of my house by the end of this year but my family is gonna throw a fit, how would I even approach them?",Adult

1265,"this is a vent post, and this seemed like the right place to go even though it's not about takin' care of business - it's about the emotional stress of living an adult life and the challenges that go along with it. i imagine you guys can relate.as for the ""adult"" side of things in this post: myself and a coworker went to hr today to bring up that our boss has been super abusive lately - temper tantrums, random fucking outbursts, shaming people for making errors. it was a tough conversation, because myself, our boss, and the people in hr that we spoke to are all friends that hang out outside of work. but the conversation had to be had. enough shitty management is enough, eventually it has to be addressed, friends or not. so all of that out of the way, i came home to an email from a very good friend who has been estranged for a year to deal with his opiate addiction. this spiraled me into the realization that most of my very good friends have moved on from the town i live in. i texted one good friend to hang out this weekend, but she's going to be out of town with her husband. it's just tough dealing with real life issues, and knowing that the friends i held dear during the college days have mostly moved on, all in different ways, and here i am. don't get me wrong - life is good - and i could be dealing with much tougher issues than i am. but i'm just really looking in the face the fact that most of my beloved friends have moved on to different areas of life, as have i, and it's tough realizing that i don't have the group i used to, especially now that we're all taking on bigger stuff. thanks for reading to whoever did - i really just needed to vent.",0,3,This post isn't about responsibilities.

1335,"if anyone reading this is like my friends then i imagine i may get some heat. i welcome a good discussion on this topic.....here's a small background of my life to get where i am coming from. i grew up poor but in a good neighborhood. didn't do well in highs school but kicked into gear in college. i worked 37 hour weeks while going to school fulltime. i graduated college early and never slept. went to state school because that is all i could afford and spent zero money on things i didn't need. it was hard. any time a friend wanted to go out to dinner or go bowling it was always a no from me, i cut my own hair, shopped only when i needed. i realized the money i had was for school and i sacrificed the social aspects to not be in a bad place in the future financially. i worked extra hours to prove to my boss i deserved a promotion which made my friends say that i am taking my job too seriously, where i just wanted it on my resume. they enjoyed joking around having fun and i decided to wait to have fun when i could afford it (i do enjoy life now :) )im not some genius, i just work hard and deal with anxiety, depression and all that. i come out of college and put every dollar i made at slightly above min wage to pay off loans because that was important to me. flash forward to 10 years out of school, i hold a high level position and my friends seem to think it was easy. they complain that they will never pay off their loans and still live with parents and take the low paying jobs. i don't love my job, i am working to afford a life where i can save for a future and provide for my family when the time comes. save for the rainy day. like the ant and the gross hopper story. my friends love their jobs and they make crap money and complain all the time that they can't make ends meet. they get mad at me for being financially okay and blame the world. i agree that the world has its issues but i also see my friends spend money on getting gel manicures and going on nice trips and still can't pay off loans. when i am asked for advice i tell them don't pay for cable or shop at price chopper not whole foods and i am looked at like i am asking them to rip their own hearts out. don't get me wrong, i love to enjoy nice things now so i get the lure. i still don't pay for cable and paint my own nails, i just got used to going without. my friends live with more luxuries making less money than i do with more. i am constantly asked to help my friends with money when they can't pay rent then show me their beautifully polished nails. i even paid phone bills for years for my friends with kids. i understand that people work hard, but i am seeing that many people don't work smart. i hadn't gone on a vacation my entire life and my friends claim they ""need"" it because life is hard. i understand wanting to relax but maybe go to the beach? (we do live on the coast). if you can't afford it, youll be more stressed later. i am the bad guy with my friends alot for being real. the friends ive helped have gone on far more vacations than i ever have. my friends tell me that it's just ""harder"" for them than me to wake up at 4am to drive 2 hrs to work because that's the job i could get at the time that paid what i needed. it's not not hard, i do it because i have to. now that i have nicer things, i am told alot about how hard they are struggling. i don't see the struggle with them. i see my friends make bad decisions and ask me to bail them out. they want the easy jobs because they can't handle stress. truth is, i can't either. i hate stress and i push my anxious limits every day. this finally hit a boiling point with me because my close friend asked to move in with my husband and i because she can't afford rent and we have extra rooms which are each of our offices. she works parttime by choice because more than 32 hours is too stressful. i explain that i work 60+hours a week to be able to not live with other people. i am an introvert and i don't want roommates. i am told i am a bad friend for this. i just feel that if i have no say in how my friends waste their money then i shouldn't have to give up the life i worked to be uncomfortable to cater to them.

(forgot to mention, my move is an 8 hour drive 1 way, so no second trip or anything like that).

1511,"[part one](https://www.reddit.com/r/adulting/comments/bgzqbc/how_to_be_a_motherfucking_successful_ass_adult/)alright. if you read part one and followed that shit, you now have stuff to cook with and on. you don’t have groceries yet (gummy bears and mountain dew are not groceries.) so here is some instructions and a couple of basic recipes you can make for your bae so that they think you are so cool and instantly want to move in and ruin the illusion that you are maintaining by going to reddit for adulting advice.  i am continuing on with the assumption that you are also poor and shopping on a budget or jeeves is off this weekend you are out of caviar. doesn’t really matter how you got here, now you are here. so buckle the fuck in, lets start this ride. step number 1. figure out what the fuck you like to eat that doesn’t come from a box. ever tried some spaghetti? like that shit? write it down. want to try and make some mashed potatoes like your grandma used to make? write it down. meatloaf makes you do weird shit with your face? write it down. figure out at least three meals that you actually want to eat that aren’t already pre-frozen.  now, google some recipes. scroll past the authors life story to get to the good shit. find out what they used in this recipe. write down the shit that is in that recipe on your grocery list. buy the ingredients. follow the recipe. eat like a king. (or eat like a college kid who hasn’t had anything but microwaved pizza for 3 months and hork that shit down. no one cares, just enjoy the fruits of your labor)  if you are too confused to follow a recipe or wanna bulk your house out with some pantry staples, you need to start somewhere. what genre of food do you prefer? mexican, italian, and french pantries all have different key ingredients that they use all the time. i can tell you that rice vinegar is never used in mexican food, but if you wanna make some home-made takeout, you will probably need it.  the absloute grocery basics are as follows: salt pepper garlic onion powder potatoes onions a few bulbs of fresh garlic balsamic vinegar olive oil (the expensive shit that comes in a tin is better quality, don’t buy your oil in clear bottles) dry pasta (i usually keep a few different types on hand, but i use spaghetti the most) brown sugar honey  (dude, even if you’re vegan, get the honey. its better for the planet and the bees, don’tcha know) ground beef/turkey (the 10 lb log of ground beef is... low quality... but if you’re poor do you really give a fuck?) chicken breast (the 20lb bag of frozen chicken breasts are fine.) bacon (the big log of bacon ends and pieces is perfect for adding flavoring to french cooking that calls for just a bit of bacon. the grease from this bitch is what you use to season your new cast iron pan too) frozen vegetables (i keep spinach, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, and brussels sprouts stocked always because i was taught to eat my v e g t a b l e s) canned foods such as: plain beans (any type) diced tomatoes, canned tuna or chicken breast, canned corn, canned green beans butter, cheese, and milk if you do dairy. i recommend substituting plain greek yoghurt for your sour cream so that you can start to grow some healthy gut flora in that barren wasteland of a body.  and of course, your vices of choice. so, soda, cookies, chips, whatever else you use to stuff your face at night when you are watching the bachelor and crying. these are the basics. if you do a fuckton of baking, you will need powdered sugar, flour, yeast, and butter. if you are a serial cereal eater, get some melk. if you prefer the fine nuances of spanish cuisine, settle in and get every single spice in the aisle, and then cry because you don’t know what estafiate is or how it’s used. if you are mormon and make a lot of casseroles, get some cream of chicken soup and tater tots. (no, sarah, no one likes your jello salad. don’t buy the fucking jello) now: here are some good as fuck simple recipes that will get you through some dark days as well as make good fucking leftovers.  white chicken chili (this recipe is going to feed 2 hungry people. double up on this shit if you have guests or want leftovers)  1 can great northern beans 1 can navy beans 1 can pinto beans 1 can diced green chiles 1 can corn 2 chicken breasts 1 tblspoon of ground cumin (cumin is awesome in a lot of things, worth it to get a big shaker) 1 tsp of paprika (get the small one, you don’t use this much) 1 tsp chili powder 1tsp onion powder 1tblspoon garlic powder 1 tblspoon mexican oregano (or plain oregano if you cant find the mexican kind) 1 tblspoon of salt and pepper drain and rinse your beans. dump the beans and everything else into your dutch oven. add a cans worth of water. bring to a boil, and then cover and let simmer for 4-8 hours, or until chicken is easily shredded with a fork. (it will take longer if you forgot to thaw your chicken) shred your chicken, top with shredded cheese and fake sour cream. dip chips into it. appreciate everyone bragging about your good cooking. and guess what? all those spices? now you have the basic ingredients to make your own taco seasoning, and those core spices form a lot of mexican cooking. don’t be a lazy person and just buy the taco seasoning packet and dump it in to this mix. just pony up, get the herbs, and learn to cook this shit the right way. i see you. step away from the seasoning mixes.  some sausage mix shit, idk what to call this but its good. 1 kielbasa sausage (find it next to the hot dogs) 2 potatoes (the lil yellow bitches are the best) ½ chopped onion 2 cans green beans or 1 small bag frozen green beans.  3 tsp garlic powder salt pepper cheese chop your shit up real fine. put the potatoes in your cast iron skillet with a little water, and let them simmer until they are soft. drain the water and add your onion and sausage, and let all the shits sit together and get a nice tan on (which means brown this shit). add your green beans last. let them also get slightly browned. add your seasoning (just add salt and pepper to taste, keep in mind the sausage is a bit salty) once everything is browned, cover the whole lot in shredded cheese and turn off the heat. put a lid on the whole skillet and let it sit for a few minutes to melt the cheese. (i literally just use a baking pan to cover because cast iron pans don’t come with lids) eat that shit uppppp. ok so that’s two recipes. i am not doing more, because now i am hungry and typing isn’t fixing the tummy rumblies. if you want more recipes, pinterest that shit, ask your mom, or try some food blogging sites. (i use budget bytes the most because she breaks it down for us poor folk) a few other small tricks that people don’t fucking tell you but are useful to know: don’t boil milk. it will scald and taste like ass. (and not the good kind you filthy creatures you) your meat must be patted dry before placing in a pan or it will not brown.  don’t know what to make? start sautéing some onion and garlic together. it will smell good and you will still not know what to make.  to sauté something means to put it in a hot pan with a bit of oil and let it get all brown.  olive oil is not good for frying. use lard, bacon grease, vegetable oil or coconut oil for high heat jobs like making fried chicken.  white vinegar is not an acceptable substitute for balsamic vinegar a super basic marinade for chicken includes balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper, olive oil and honey. let chicken chill in the marinade for like a day and then pat dry and cook. good. as. fuck.  almost all plant milk can be subbed out for cow milk, but only the unsweetened unflavored kind. no. do not put vanilla soy milk in a milk based soup. adding an acid, such as vinegar, or lemon juice to your cooking will elevate it to the next level. try adding some lemon juice to your creamy chicken ramen. it’s dope. if you are cooking and it doesn’t taste “right” add an acid.  frozen vegetables have the same nutrient content as their fresh counterparts and are often cheaper. if you are going to cook it anyways, get the frozen veggies. your wallet will say thanks. if you don’t know how to use herbs in the kitchen, literally just start. get one of those pre filled spice racks that walmart sells for like $20, and while you are cooking sniff the herbs and put in whatever you think will be good. there isn’t really a right or wrong way to do it, and you will quickly learn that some things don’t taste well together. or just buy a spice blend pre made and take the easy way out, that also works.  if you want to step outside your comfort zone, buy a random cut of meat that your budget allows, and then google the best way to prepare it. (but like, no one is judging you if you stay far away from the livers and never try those.)  oatmeal is one of the best breakfasts you can eat in the morning, the complex carbs are slow digesting and keep you full through the morning along with giving energy. most breakfast cereals have more sugar than a doughnut. freeze your shit. see strawberries on sale for $1 a carton? buy an extra and freeze one. find meat on sale? buy as much as you can and freeze the extra for later. bread and even milk and cheese can be frozen without affecting the flavor of the product.  so, tldr; uh... dude. idk. read this shit, because i am not good enough at talking to surmise all of the amazingly useful info that i just wrote down into a single short sentence. maybe...learn to cook? ",9,58,"Being a Motherfucking Successful Ass Adult, Part Two: How the fuck to cook more than top Ramen",Adult
1512,"eating is a fucking fact of life. it’s going to happen. and if you want to be a successful adult, you’re going to have to actually cook something for yourself that’s not fucking top ramen or microwave hot dogs. if you want to impress your fucking friends with how much of an adult you can be, eat your shit on matching plates with matching silverware and watch their fucking minds get blown. so, you moved into your first cool ass apartment. you have like 4 laundry baskets full of clothes and some trash bags full of shit that your parents sent you off with to “start your new life”. maybe your mom gave you her old cooking shit. and that’s fine, those will get you through the first few months or years. but at some point, you have to buy some shit on your own. you’re going to have to pony up some dough for this stuff. it doesn’t have to be all at once, you can buy a small set of 2 or 4 place settings to get your feet under you, and then once your friends start actually eating at your place, you can spring for those extra place settings so that they aren’t eating on fucking styrofoam (why are you even buying that, you planet killer?). to start out with, you will need:  some shit to eat off of. this includes: cups mugs (if you drink hot shit like coffee or tea) plates, both salad and dinner plates you goddamn heathen.  bowls silverware/cutlery   some shit to cook with. this includes: a pan/skillet. do not buy those nonstick fuckers from wal-mart that are cool colors and only cost $10. do you want to get poisoned when that coating flakes off into your scrambled eggs? get a cast iron pan. if you’re broke, get one from the thrift store. (you may have to hunt for it for a few weeks. you’re poor, do you think this shit is going to be easy to find? the cheap cost is going to cost you some afternoons digging for shit you want.) a dutch oven or a large stainless-steel pot with a lid. get something oven safe, and large enough to make enough soup for at least six people. dutch ovens will last you for literally the rest of your life and can be used as a weapon, so i recommend going for that one. ask around. bet you that some rich old lady in the suburbs near your college town is getting rid of one for cheap.  a small sauce pot, because sometimes you only need to make ramen for one. (you lonely fucker) yeah. looking at the price tags on these fucks is a bit daunting. but a set of some non-stick ass ugly “starter” pans are $100-300 bucks. (ok, yes, on black friday they may be only $30. but don’t let your aching wallet get you poisoned) a good nonstick skillet will run anywhere from $20-80, depending on how big you want it. one’s big enough to cook a fucking pizza are going to be more expensive, but lucky for you the single serving pans are within your budget. a dutch oven will be anywhere from $40-500, depending on how classy you wanna get. keep in mind this fuck will last for the next 50 years of your life and then can be handed down to your broke college grandkids, so it’s worth it to pony up a little more for a sturdy one. and a stainless sauce pot is like $20. get 100% stainless so that its oven safe, avoid the stainless pots with the plastic handles.  if you are on some fucking cooking utensils. a flat edge spatula (get metal- it's going to last and the extra $1 upfront will make a difference) a wooden spoon (if you are kinky, separate spoons, one for the kitchen and one for the bedroom. don’t cross contaminate), and a rubber spatula. if you wanna take it to the next level, also get a ladle and a whisk. (again, metal.) some knives. ok. so, this piece right here is really important. a good knife makes a difference. you need a chef’s knife. it’s the big scary fucker with a blade longer than your hand. it’s not serrated. preferably full tang. yes, the $14 off brand one is fine. no, the pink one is not fine. (you really are in to eating paint coating like that?) get a bread knife. this one is long and serrated. get some steak knives if you eat steak or are bad at cooking so you have to chop your shit. and finally, get a manual knife sharpener. because a sharp knife is safer than a dull one. (you can google that shit because i ain’t got enough time to explain the cooking basics of why it’s safer)  get a cutting board. a big fucker. i got mine from ikea, it’s literally the same size as my counter. it was $14. i use it every. single. day. if you don’t wanna do a big fucker, get a medium fucker. bamboo cutting boards are cheap. get a plastic one for meat only. that one can be small unless you butcher shit then idk dude. i don’t know enough about butchering to tell you what you need. get a can opener. idk how the fuck to pick a good one with this tool bro. i go through can openers like yearly. none of them work, they all make you angry, and they all result in cursing.  measuring cups and spoons. - these don’t have to be fancy; plastic will do. a pyrex glass pouring cup thing is nice but not always needed. mixing bowls and some good baking sheets and pans. glass and metal are king here, leave that plastic mixing bowl at your grandma’s house. baking sheets don’t really matter- they are going to rust and get stained and look all gross pretty much no matter what you do. i will say if they aren’t flimsy then there is less of a chance of your pizza sliding off of the now bent pan and onto the floor.  appliances if you want them. you already have a microwave probably, but you don’t need it to survive. a blender comes in handy if you’re a smoothie slut, but again, not needed. if you drink coffee, a french press will make you look fancy, but a plain coffee maker also does the job. appliances are just icing on the kitchen cake; you don’t really need a $400 kitchen aid mixer unless you are starting a new business where you bake from home.  if you are on a budget and don’t mind hunting for a deal, you can get all your kitchen shit for under $300. invest in your shit. do it. i get it. you have no flexible income; you are barely making it paycheck to paycheck but you still want the satisfaction of being an adult. buying one piece at a time is still progress if that’s what you want to do. as far as buying kitchen stuff, ikea is a godsend. their dishes are new and often cheaper than thrift store prices, and they now ship to your house, so you don’t have to navigate their confusing ass floor setups. i have owned both fine bone china that costs $30 a plate, and the ikea dishware that cost me $30 for a full set of 6. i prefer my ikea set.   bro, i get it if you are poor. i’m poor too. which is why i do my future self a favor and wait a little longer between getting kitchen tools so that i can save up for the lasting shit or so i can find a good deal. because i went through 10 different cheap wal-mart pans before getting cast iron, and i ate way too much teflon coating before i realized that i would save money and effort long haul by just buying the good shit.   want to know how much i paid for all my shit to help put it into perspective?  cast iron- used found at the thrift $14 dutch oven- used found at the thrift $5.50 (on sale down from $9) ikea dish set- $35 for 6 place settings clear water glasses – wal-mart $10/4 (tbh the dollar tree has the same glasses, i was pissed when i saw that i paid too much)  target gold cutlery (shut up, i want to be fancy) $25/set 4 chef’s knife- wal-mart $14  knife sharpener- amazon $8 cutting board- ikea $20 (?) i looked it up and they no longer make the same one i have, the new one is differently shaped. i think i paid like $14-$20, so i am rounding up.  assorted coffee mugs and fancy colored wine glasses- thrifted, $.50 -$1 each /6 count metal cooking utensils- $3-7 each, with the most expensive being my stainless-steel spatula sheet pans- $1-5 each. i buy a lot of them from the dollar tree, once they rust too much, i recycle them.  mason jars- 2 sets $10 each (i use these instead of tupperware because they are multi use)  pyrex mixing bowls $20 (bought these on black friday, they are always going on sale)  and then i also had shit gifted to me and run a small baking side gig from my house, so yea, i have more shit than this list, but this doesn’t apply to what i am talking about so shaddup. you too can have items gifted to you for the low low price of marriage and guilting friends and family to purchase things for you.   so. tldr; buy metal utensils. cheap, matching dishes are awesome. cast iron is a badass and makes you look cool to cook in and care for it. buy metal shit. literally, it's going to last you years and years and years and years. you can do pretty much every kind of chopping and slicing you need with a nice chef's knife and a sharpener. get rid of your stained tupperware you garbage person. being broke doesn’t mean you can’t successfully adult in the kitchen.",34,224,How to be a motherfucking successful ass adult; Part One.

1531,"was back home for spring break a couple weeks back. i’m a sophomore in college now, and very different compared to how i was when i was 14/15. i’m an adult now and i have responsibilities and i know when to turn the other cheek and walk away from arguments (lots of homeless where i go to college, i know how not to get caught up when they scream stuff at me) but damn does visiting home after years really make you think a lot.so i was walking down this street where i used to hang out when i was 14/15, and there was these four young kids around that age standing around the corner store. i passed by, and one of them made a snide comment about my hair (it’s spring break, i walk around with whatever hairstyle i wake up with). i glanced at them and walked in, and when i was done and left, they made another comment. nothing serious really.for some reason though, this just really caught me off guard maybe because of how it just reminded me so much of how i’d hang out on the same street with my friends and do the same thing. it just got me thinking a lot, about how if i had been their age such comments would strangely warrant a confrontation right away (and perhaps a fight), but the current me, just barely five years older, had actually passed by them without so much as a glance and a smirk without saying anything. i know exactly what those kids were doing, because i used to do the same. they hang around and look for trouble, trying to prove to one another that they’re tough guys, and it’s all just harmless fun really. i just can’t stop thinking about how surreal it felt though, it was almost like seeing a younger me except i was totally unrecognizable. i think about how things were back then, how we fought over small things like comments about how you look, and how things are so different now. if an adult ever got into a confrontation over something as trivial as that, everyone would look at you funny, but with kids, it’s just kids being kids. i guess this must be one of those things people my age have to get used to, which feels funny. to think that only just a couple years ago, i could beat up someone for saying something like that to me, but now just a handful of years later, societal norms are that i walk in the store, grab my stuff, and walk out without paying these “childish” kids any attention. adulting sure is different.",3,5,"Not looking for advice or anything, but wanted to share an experience",Adult

1815,"if university is elementary school,grad school is middle school,andphd is high school,then i'm back to constantly wishing i was in high school again. 'high schoolers' seem to be able to do whatever they want and have more independence, get to travel more, get to study in their field of choice and do real-world stuff and research, go to awesome conferences and learn important interesting stuff and eat good quality food, not shitty dining common food, and seem to be socially allowed to feel confident and secure with themselves (or as secure as a human can get).i can't wait til i'm in high school!(ok but fr, i know the whole college-masters-phd system is messed up rn and there're so many issues, don't even get me started on the crippling debt, but just ignore all that, suspend your disbelief, and pretend you're a kid when you're reading that)but seriously, about that last part, i'm going to go on a tangent. although college life has been ok so far, i don't think i'll ever fully be satisfied with where i am in life. right now, i'm pretty secure about who i am and what i want to do, as well as what makes me comfortable, my beliefs, and my personal standards for myself and others. but for some reason i feel pressured to feel insecure about everything. i feel like i should care more about how others perceive and judge me, although i truly don't care at all unless the situation truly calls for it (job interviews and such). i feel like i have a good sense of social awareness, but i also feel like i unintentionally come off as intimidating or a jerk. it's just for some reason here at this university, the constant lectures and bulletins keep encouraging people that it's ok not not have everything figured out, that it's ok to not be this and that, and i know i might be blowing things out of proportion, but it seems like if these bulletins don't apply to you, then what are you even doing here? you must be doing something wrong. you should feel insecure about everything. so sometimes i go through the day wondering if i should give more fucks about the smaller stuff and start thinking about the insecurities i currently have. i know it's not good to give no fucks at all, rather it's better to pripritize them for the important things with a limited supply instead of giving them out freely.for instance, whenever i'm out with college friends, they sometimes compliment me about how i seem to have all my shit figured out, although i really don't. my roommate constantly degrades her appearance, asking me if she looks ugly, if she should change something, if she should join this club, if i can go out with her, etc. and i usually just compliment her or tell her it's fine and doesn't matter that much, or whenever i'm exhaused don't say anything at all, but then she gets offended and continues degrading herself and it's awkward. i feel simultaneously more put together and insecure whenever situations like this happen, because i have my own insecurities about things, and this puts me into an existential crisis about my stage in life, and i feel even more pressured to bring them up to be more relatable, although i can't, because would they really understand? i brought some of them up with my roommate and one other friend once, on two seperate occasions, and they both shut me down, instead telling me something along the lines of 'wow you seem to have your shit figured out.' but that doesn't make me feel better or help at all. i'm not particularly stressed about exams, but i feel like i'm doing something wrong by sleeping early and playing video games during most of the day. i used to go out a lot when i was a teenager in real middle and high school, but now that i'm an adult i rarely feel fomo whenever a party happens anymore (which is like every single day) or whenever people are going out doing stuff. for some reason, i feel like i should feel fomo even though i prefer staying in. what i really want is to surround myself with just a few high-quality people i feel comfortable with and have shared hobbies and values with, and get together sometimes, if not routinely, but it seems almost impossible to find. people here either want to go out constantly or not at all, and even though it's easy making friends, i can't keep them down.what can i do to catch up to everyone else? i always feel behind, like i'm not doing enough, maybe i should take on another project? but my old ones won't get finished, and i always get to a point where i'm stuck. but if i don't do this, how will i get ahead and stand out when it comes to employment? i want to pursue projects i'm genuinely interested in, but should i care more about employment-related ones? and also, i don't even have the proper skillsets to finish the ones i'm working on. everyone's on linkedin, instagram, and whatsapp now, getting married, traveling for conferences and work, and there's me, happening to get really passionate about the field i want to get into 10 years too late and trying to stay off social media, yet still creating accounts to not fall behind. then there's the guy my age who just retired after teaching a graduate-level course for his entirety of high school years in the field because he got really into it right on time. but then i'm super jealous because intead of falling into the ratrace like me and everyone else, he decided to pursue what he was passionate about and perfect his skills instead of mindlessly going through preschool cramming for useless aptutude tests that really don't measure the quality of the individual or the aptitude. it's like we're all in a lab but people like him escaped somehow.then i have to make sure to stay above a 3.2 gpa, but if i don't get near a 4.0 then my chances at being accepted into the other college decrease by something like 80%. i constantly feel stupid, especially in language classes where i'm learning at an elementary level and still get confused from time to time.i know i should care more about living my best life and stop comparing myself to others, but it gets difficult whenever i think about things like this. although i stopped caring about social media and trends around 5 years ago, now it seems like i have to start again just to be able to have something to talk about, but i'm not really interested so i don't for the most part.that's why whenever i'm with my friends who are pursuing their masters/phd, i feel simultaneously secure and insecure about myself as well. i feel like it's more socially acceptable to act and feel confident about myself and give less fucks about small things like appearance or trends, so it's less of a social burden, and i feel less anxiety and more comfortable around them, but at the same time i feel behind and wish i could be where they are now, especially the ones who are in the field i want to get into. i especially hate it whenever they tell me 'you'll figure it out eventually' because i feel even more behind. around my college friends, i'm the one who has things figured out. around my other friends, i'm the one with tons of potential who will eventually have things figured out. i hate being told i have it all figured out, but also hate being told the opposite.either way i still feel discontent and insecure about my stage in life in general. i feel like i'm going through a quarter-life crisis, does anyone else feel the same way?",0,3,"If university is elementary school for adults, then I'm back to wishing I was in high school again.",Adult

1992,"i have some advice for those who have small savings and aren’t investing - scroll to the bottom of you want to pass my rant.i went to close my bank account the other day at wellsfargo because i was switching to chase. (my husband and i were about to buy a house and it just worked better mortgage wise - but after this account i was definitely not staying with them). anyways, while i’m there i overhear this women speaking spanish. she was asking the bank teller why she was being charge when she had $500 in her account - the minimum needed to avoid $10/day fees. i had several issues with this. 1) it’s “covid” time so this women had to make an appointment ahead of time and asked for someone who spoke spanish and yet they still did not have anyone at the time to who spoke spanish. 2) i feel like this freaking rule only exists, among other things, as a way to make money off the poor and reward the rich. i do not feel like i qualify as “rich” but i went over because i knew for a fact that i was not being charged $10 and i had less than $500 in my checking. i also was no longer getting direct deposit or any of the other ways this fee is waived. but i did have all of the savings we were going to use for our down payment for the house in my savings account there. i saw on my account, prior to closing it, that my fee for my checking has been waived for months, months, and i knew it was because they didnt want to loose me as a customer. i have also previously (while i was in college) had a dispute about those fees with the banker and they had given me the money back so as not to loose my business. but here, for this women, they kept telling her there was nothing they could do without even understanding a word she was saying! i was so angry i walked over and explained to them (and the women) that i had had my fees waived and that if they could do it for me there was absolutely no reason they couldn’t do it for her. and that i was appalled they didn’t have someone around to speak spanish to her and explain the situation. i finally got them to waive her fees but explained to her that she would need to keep a min daily balance of $500, get direct deposit, or switch to another bank (which i suggested) because i didn’t know if anyone would help her next time. after they apologized to me, me not her????, i told them it didn’t matter because i was closing my account today. when they asked why, i looked at them like really? that just happened and you’re wondering why i don’t want to bank with you??anyways, if you’re struggling with banks, you almost don’t need the conventional ones these days. my best advice, if you’re starting to save and don’t currently actively invest into stocks through a roth-ira, is to open a wealthfront account. here is a link, or search via web. here's your referral link to get $5k managed for free when you fund a wealthfront investment account. learn more and redeem at: https://www.wealthfront.com/c/affiliates/invited/affd-zwxh-v1rt-v1ki basically you’ll earn way more from wealthfront in your savings than any conventional bank. and you can get a debit card from them or transfer to venmo or what have you. the hardest part would be if you need to access cash. but there are no charges or fees. you can also open a roth-ira through them ans they’ll manage investing ans money for you. i hate banks - conventional ones anyways - so let’s fuck em and help each other out. if anyone knows better ways to save or store money - post in the comments!",9,2,Rant on why I hate banks,Adult

2190,"so i’m not sure if this is the right sub reddit for my specific situation but here goes nothing. when i was in high school i fucked around all the time and i barely graduated with like a 2.3 gpa. i really don’t remember any of the content such as math science geometry etc. ever since i graduated i’ve been working in a warehouse with good health benefits and i make 20 an hour so i never really left my comfort zone with that. however i suffered a major shoulder injury requiring surgery rendering me out of work. it made me realize that i can’t just work menial labor jobs that pay just enough for rent and weed my whole life. i’ve always wanted to go to college and get a higher education however covid has put a wrench in that and even before the pandemic the thought of being in debt to student loans for the rest of my life petrifies  me since i will be paying my way through by myself with no help from my parents at all. my biggest worry is ending up in a field that i hate and end up bailing in the middle of it or the demand in whatever field will be bad when i graduate.if i were to shoot for the stars and go for my dream job, i would be a commercial pilot. i know it’s a long and expensive road to get there (flight hours etc) but honestly, i have no clue on where to begin on that path. like what college classes would i even start off with ? do i need to take like some general education course before i take aviation classes? and this is kind of a stretch, but i was born in the philippines with the filipino birth certificate. is it possible that i could get dual citizenship, take all the required college courses, get all the flight hours required for my licenses, and fly with a philippines based airline? that’s kind of a stretch, but dream big right? what one man can do, another man can do.if the above seems unreasonably difficult to achieve, i could see myself going to trade school and learning a trade such as welding. people always talk about how great of a career it is, but welders i know tell me the nitty-gritty of the career. i feel like that would be a decent fit for me. ever since i was 16, i’ve been working manual labor jobs ranging from pushing carts at walmart in the summer heat, freezing cold, or the humid rain storms we get here to working in a -10° freezer had a major grocery distribution center stacking boxes on pallets etc.i don’t know who else to ask besides reddit. all my friends are either in the military or a different part of the world now and my parents ghosted me at 18. and don’t suggest military to me because i am banned from all branches due to a domestic assault charge and yes i checked with the recruiters. obviously money is important to pay rent, but i don’t wanna live like this for my entire life, working a job that i hate, barely pays enough etc. i want to have a career that i can be proud of and also make enough money for me to live better than i do now.also, all of this text it was used from speech to text so please forgive some of the errors",2,1,20 years old and I’m not sure where to even begin my life,Adult

2213,"i’m a 23 year old woman, an undergrad at an academically rigorous university. i feel like my spirit is being crushed and smothered under the weight of loving but critical and overbearing helicopter parents, societal pressure to “do my best all the time,” a feeling of disconnect from people my age, lack of belonging, and and my own possibly hyper-developed (in a bad way) self-awareness. even before coronavirus, i started to feel a kind of nostalgic longing for the 70s and 80s, how it looked and the kinds of things the “kids” did. i don’t feel the same about the counterculture/subcultures today. maybe they were the same back then but today there is something pretty embarrassing about being a part of one, and they are all splintered. but i long for that sense of fun and excitement and newness and belonging i imagine one might have felt, say, being in the punk scene in the 80s, living in new york. i know that’s a lot to ask for and there are certainly tons of great and important movements (blm for instance) and subcultures like that now, but something about there’s something about beginning of punk rock and 80s indie rock (buzzcocks, ramones, husker du, the replacements, etc. etc.)... there’s plenty of great bands now that i love just as much, even more, but i don’t know if it’s still a scene, or a movement. i go to shows and dance my heart out, i feel so much joy, and so do the others in there but i still feel so alone. we are all alone.it doesn’t help that i have happened to become friendly and/or fascinated with people who went to high school in the 70s and college in the early to mid 80s. their stories are wild, and always bring a smile to my face. i get a fuzzy warm feeling just listening to them, followed by an ache. these are celebrities and real people, too. and it’s not just the drugs. i’m not into very hard drugs and i feel lucky i haven’t had a lot of experience with them. it’s more about the freedom, the carelessness, the rebelliousness, the sense of being in something together, the belongingness, a common enemy, plus of course, the sex, the music as a communal experience and just the... fun. it’s probably a me thing not a society thing i realize that. freedom in a huge one. without technology, i think, students had more freedom from their parents and from each other. you couldn’t have your location tracked on a cell phone, you weren’t expected to be in constant contact with everyone. i feel like you could get away with a lot more. you may make more mistakes but then you’d learn from them. something bad might happen to you but it could happen to you despite very precaution you take or how much you were monitored and controlled (im living proof of that). i’m sure going to college in the 80s had its downsides (like no computers and less support from the school and teachers). most didn’t have the advantages that come from being close to their parents or having as much material or financial support or mental health support., but what i’ve noticed is that with all of that comes a great loss of freedom. everything you do matters so much now. everyone’s handing out advice and monitoring you (i’m not talking about the government, but professors, parents and therapists). you end up feeling like you have so many issues and problems that need to be fixed because you have so many psychiatric diagnoses.",1,1,I’m only 23 but nostalgic for the 70s and 80s.

2624,"thank you in advance to anyone willing to read this wall of text. if you know a better subreddit to post for advice on this, let me know! anyways:after a few great visits to philly, i'm beginning to seriously consider moving out there. i have a friend from college currently at temple for dentistry, and a cousin who i'm pretty close with working/living in the city. i think i've successfully infiltrated his friend group, and i met a girl out on my own during my last visit, so i have a little bit of a network already hahah.**my situation:**i went to college in upstate ny, earned a b.s. in it, moved back home (north jersey) almost two years ago and ended up finding work outside of my field of study and just kind of got stuck in the job. i hate it, pay is not impressive at all (about 32k/year after taxes) but i'm pretty minimalist so i've been able to save, solid benefits. honestly i didn't know what the heck i wanted to do with my life after college so my time at this job gave me time to think and figure it out a little bit. now that i have an idea though, i'm itching to get out of this job and get started on building that life.**reasons to move:**honestly there's nothing really wrong with my home life. i don't have a good relationship with my brother but we stay out of each others' way. my mom and i are close, and my dad and i get along pretty well 90% of the time. they know i'm safe/responsible when i go out so they let me do my thing without any rules/interference. i just feel like it's time to take the next step in life and take full control. i like where i live, but it just feels a little stale. i tend to get restless when i'm in the same place for too long. not to mention rent is crazy in north jersey, so it wouldn't make sense/be worth it to move out to somewhere local. furthermore, i'm ready to quit my job, but i wouldn't want to get a new job in an area that i'm not happy with and end up quitting again in order to move. i've only been at this first job for a year and a half, so doing that would look bad on my resume.so onto my concerns.**the financial:**how much did you guys have saved up when you moved out?  right now, i've got about 10k in the bank, 4k in a 401k (3.5k vested, so i'd lose a bit if i left my job), fully paid off car worth maybe 8-9k, 11k in student loans. i pay about $500/mo into my student loans, $80ish a month for my phone plan, $150/mo for car insurance (under my mom's plan, it will be a good bit more if i move out based on the quotes i looked at before purchasing since i'm young). from what i've seen, i think i could get a decent (decent for 22 y/o man with low standards) 1br in the city for around $700-1000, or a less than decent place for a bit less. credit score is around 750. i feel pretty good about where i'm at, but i know it's a lot different when you're out on your own. do you think i would be able to secure a lease with my standing? i'm young and i'd be a first time renter obviously, so i know i'd be seen as a risk either way.**the guilt:**how did you deal with the guilt you felt (if you felt it) moving away from home? i know my mom would be upset. i'm not all that close with my dad, but he is sick. he doesn't require anyone to take care of him, but it could come to that sooner than later. they're both getting older, and i feel almost selfish for wanting to leave. i love my parents, but i think i'm at that point where i'm ready to experience life on my own terms. i don't think that's unreasonable, but i don't know. hard to say it isn't selfish. my brother lives at home, but he's kind of a fuck-up for lack of a better term. he causes more trouble than good for both of my parents, so that's another thing to be concerned about. thoughts?**tldr**recent college grad feeling the itch to spread wings and ffflllyyyyyyyyyyyy on to new city and new life. decent (i think) financial standing, but guilt about ""abandoning"" parents. what do",3,4,"I think I'm ready to move out, but some things are weighing on my mind",Adult

2710,"lately i've been feeling the need to work on some fundamental things that come up often in my life, but it's hard to know where i can go for answers. sometimes it's because i feel like the question is about a really basic life or social skill.example: how do i know when my conduct is appropriate? how do i judge if a question is impertinent versus pushing the envelope in a positive way in a classroom or workplace setting?sometimes it's just a complicated issue that i'm not sure who would have the answer to.example: i am a leader in situations where i am reasonably in control of situations. among friends, i'm buoyed up to be the one who decides everything from what we're doing for a reunion to what's the best way to help someone move house. but when i'm assigned to a group for a college class project, i lock up. i want to do everything, because i feel that i cannot work well with my groupmates and fear their expectations for the project criteria will be different or lower than mine (100% grade chaser here). how do i turn assigned groupwork into a chance to grow my leadership skills, rather than an awful stressful experience? what can i do in those situations to ensure that the groupwork goes smoothly, without needing to worry that the ""cs get degrees"" groupmates will want to do something different than what i want to do?and sometimes it's because i have no idea how to present an issue, especially if i feel like whoever i'm asking really has to understand who i am and where i'm coming from to understand how to answer without assuming some generalized truth that may or may not apply to my situation. example: i struggle with a war between not wanting to be arrogant but also recognizing &amp; utilizing my skills. i don't want to ""be better than other people"", but there are some settings when it's clear that of the pool of people around me, i have the most experience or knowledge about the task at hand. how does one step up honestly about their abilities in a non-arrogant way, without undervaluing themselves? it seems to me like i can only be at one extreme or the other.with these types of questions, i have no idea who to go to. they feel too personal to bring up with professors i barely know at times, and i've had mixed luck asking peers at the same stage in their life as me.where should i be going?",7,6,Where do you go with hard questions/needing advice when you lack mentors/parental figures you trust/admire?,Adult

(that seems like the straightforward approach) basically, the problem is - i don't drink. like, at all. total teetotaler. my biggest excuse thus far for it is that i'm just underage. the more true reason though is that i have something of an addictive personality. i'm worried that if i were to start drinking more than just a little, i might accidentally fall into it and develop a problem. so, in a profession where you need to know that you're making good-tasting drinks, wouldn't that be a problem? wouldn't i need to hone a taste for that kind of thing to be able to work with it properly? if that's the case, i don't think i'd mind giving up not drinking, and i'd probably be able to drink responsibly if i had to start, but i'm still nervous about making that kind of decision. i know that this seems like a trivial issue, but it does matter to me somewhat.anyways, all general advice would be appreciated, but if there is anyone who could fill me in better on what a bartender's job is actually like (and if you need a good taste for alcohol) so that i have a more accurate perception of this idea, that'd be a great help.",9,21,"20M, need some career advice or just general future advice, not sure if this is the right place to post, but here goes",Adult

3121,"so let me give you a bit of background. my father is from germany, born and raised in berlin. he has had a visa in america for quite some time and has recently acquired dual citizenship in america. he has not really been in my life for the first 23 years. i’ve seen him in person twice. but now at age 26 he has told me he wants to get me german citizenship as his way of helping me with my life (idk if he feels guilty and finally wants to start helping me out or what). i have this notion due to him saying he is 65 and could die any day so he wants to do something for his only child that will benefit me for the rest of my life. he tells me that i can continue my education and obtain my masters degree for free at a german public university. he also told me at first that i would be able to obtain my dual citizenship in germany. he has been telling me these things for the past 2 years, then we recently talked (about 5 min ago) and he all of a sudden threw in that he can help get me my permanent residency instead of his usual “i can get you dual citizenship” line.so i asked him “can i not obtain dual-citizenship like you said?” which he proceeds to say i would have to drop my american citizenship to become a german citizen. then he tells me its possible, but i would have to get government permission like he did. this seemed kind of fishy to me because he all of a sudden switched up exactly what he was saying 3 months before i am suppose to visit germany and “feel it out.” so honestly i’m at a cross roads, i don’t know if i should trust him because he hasn’t really been in my life so i frankly don’t know what type of person he is. my mom always tells me she wants me to not be in the position to fully depend on him because he’s a controlling person, but how can i not when i don’t know the language and am going to be living with him. she hasn’t seen him since i was born, people can change.  he also wanted a copy of my drivers license when i turned 18 when he visited me, but after that i he hasn’t visited me since. i have a small intuition telling me he is using me but i cant say for sure. maybe he does want to better my life, but the pattern over the past 26 years would prove otherwise. he’s been living in los angeles 6 months out of every year for a minimum of 20 years yet doesn’t make the effort to visit me (once ever). i live in georgia. he has never paid a dime of child support, and he has probably sent me a total of $600 dollars in my lifetime which half of that was sent when i graduated college. from what i get out of it he seems like a person thats really about himself, but i guess people can change.so really what i’m asking is a few things:1) can i actually get dual citizenship?2) can i obtain my mba in europe for free? (i already have a bachelors in business administration)3) does he really need a photo copy of my passport to buy me a plane ticket to germany?4) why does he need official id’s of me to “do stuff for me?” 5) should i trust him and give him a chance to help me?thanks for your help!!",7,1,American thinking of getting German citizenship,Adult

3535,"in literally just 3 days i’m turning 21. the big 21. the age when everyone considers you as a real adult and starts taking you more serious. ever since i was around 12/13, i’ve had horrible social anxiety and sadly a huge lack of a social life. i mean i was popular in school, nobody was mean to me, most people loved me because i was sweet and kind. i talked to my mom about my lack of social life and she said it’s because i was just so quiet it just made me seem unapproachable, which i believe her. like i said, people really liked me. i just never really talked unless i was spoken to first, or had to talk for certain reasons. i could never hold a conversation and still can’t. one, because i have a fear of saying something and it will sound stupid and embarrassing, and two, i just genuinely never know what to say as stupid as that sounds. i get all panicky when socializing. so i most likely came off as rude and uninterested. in school i would get invited to hang out with others and join them in some activities. i just too quiet and everyone thought i was just simply “shy.” it wasn’t until only a few years ago i realized it went much more deeper then just shyness and that’s when i figured i have social anxiety. like it’s hard for me to order my own food from restaurants or fast food places for example, although recently it has sort of gotten better. not quite, but a little. i used to always have my mom order my food for me. same thing for paying for anything like food, clothes, groceries, etc... and you’re not gonna believe this, but at almost 21, i’ve actually never payed for groceries yet and i’ve only ever payed for my own clothes like maybe twice in my life. i hate to stay it but i still cling to my parents like a helpless child because of my anxiety. so i really feel like it has caused me to be so emotionally behind everyone my age. i never even went to university or college. while most people my age are already about to graduate and have moved out of their parents house. and i’m not gonna lie when i say that moving out terrifies me so freaking much. luckily i have parents who say i can live with them for as long as i want. they actually love having me around. but i feel embarrassed. i’ve never even had a “real” job. i only just got my first job cleaning a bank after they close for a little over an hour monday-saturday. super easy. but it’s only $500 a month. my mom is also doing that job with me too. i hate it so much that i’m like this and i feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. i’ve only ever had two best friends my whole life and that’s it. one who i’m still best friends with to this day since kindergarten and the other i haven’t seen since around 2013/2014 because she had to move and we just lost contact with each other. but yeah. i’ve never had an actual “friend group” like the majority of people my age and younger. and i seriously feel like my time is running out to get out there and make many friends and memories. kim taehyung, my idol is a social butterfly who’s always been popular even before idol life. he’s always been able to make friends and he’s always been very popular. in school and now. why can’t i be like that? why am i the exact opposite of that? and i feel like that if he ever met me he would hate me and think i’m so boring and want nothing to do with... and i know he’s not shallow like that. but my mind tells me all these things. like why would a social butterfly wanna even try to be friends with a boring girl with bad social anxiety and has no social life? it would be such a waste of time for someone like him. and honestly, i just d word because of the way i am especially at my age. it hurts and it eats at me every single day of my life.",2,1,(Serious) I’m literally anxious af about adulthood and growing up,Adult

3890,"hello, i am trying to figure out how to buy a car on my own for the first time. i am currently living ~4 hour drive from my parents so they aren't really able to help me in person like before, and there's not really any cars of interest in my price range near them. i'm looking to buy a car due to issues with my current. i brought it in to a shop the other day to discover my front wheel bearing needs replacement, my rear brake pads need to be replaced, i have a nail in one of my tires, my brake lines need to be flushed, my air filter needs replacement, and my ac compressor is broken. the important things i was quoted $1000 to fix and the air compressor would be another $1000. my current car is a 2008 honda accord with 125k miles. it also has some front end damage (hood and grill only, not structural). i believe the kbb trade in value is somewhere between $2-3k, without any of the other issues. i do not have the money currently to fix it, and most of the issues impact the safety of the car so i can't really put them off and pay for them as i get the funds. i drive a lot, i bought this car in 2018 at 64k miles, so i drive around 25-30k a year. in 2016 i bought a 2009 vw jetta with 74k miles and it became unfixable in 2018 with 120k miles. most of the issues from that car were believed to be caused by an accident (another car hit my parked car at around 55 mph) in 2017. the car was not totalled then, was supposedly fixed, and my insurance company wouldn't total it later when it had the unfixable issues in 2018, even though mechanics said it was caused by the accident shifting the body of the car. this resulted in me being upside down on my loan with that car, which was a 60 mo loan at 2.75%. i still owed about $6000.after that i swore i wouldn't take a loan of that term out on a car again. i had been waiting to get a new car until this spring after i graduated college and would be able to work full time year round and ideally have a shorter term loan. however, i'm now stuck with these issues. because i put so much mileage on my cars and have run into so many issues around 120k miles, i really don't feel like it's the best idea to get anything with over 60-70k. i found a 2010 honda crv with only 37k miles, no accidents, single owner, for about $12k that i really like. i was planning on getting a loan through my state credit union, but i discovered that they don't give loans for cars over 10 years. now, i am finding that a lot of places won't, either. ideally, i would like to keep my payments below $200, $250 max. i'm really just not sure how to go from here. i know i need my dad to co-sign for me because my credit score has dropped a lot this year (thanks to covid, being unemployed and trying to pay rent at a college apt i no longer live at) do i get pre-approved for a loan first? do i go to the dealer (honda dealer) and see what their options are? look for something cheaper but with more miles / less reputable make? i'd like to get something larger, but of course crossovers/suvs are more expensive. how do i go about trading my car in and getting the most value? how do i avoid overpaying or being swindled by a dealer? any and all advice is appreciated. also, my current income is ~$1500/mo, and i pay around $250 in rent now. i will be moving to a larger city come august but rent should stay about the same (i split a bedroom with my partner while having roommates), ideally getting a job using my degree (mechancial engineering). additionally, i might move back home this summer and work my serving job making $150-300/day living rent free. tldr what on earth is the actual process of buying and financing a car",3,1,How do I buy a car?

(coffee shops, downtown area, bars, etc) 3. if there is a young demographic. for example my parents live in a city but there are hardly any sub-35 year olds that live there. 4. i’m a young woman so safety in cities is always a concern, i’d love to be able to move somewhere that i could walk my dog around my neighborhood and not be scared shitless. 5. i am a fairly outdoorsy person so i’d love if there were parks/open spaces/natural beauty nearby. some places i’ve been maybe looking at -1. portland, or 2. tacoma, wa (tho i’ve heard mixed things, i’d love more input)3. eugene, or (have also been told it can be intensely boring however....)4. bellevue, wa i’ve grown up on the west coast my entire life, but i have been thinking of a couple eastern cities/places? 5. boston, ma6. minneapolis, mn",5,1,"Good, not crazy expensive cities to live in in your 20s?",Adult

4807,"hi i'm 24f and an elementary school teacher. i truly do try my best to stay out of drama, i was involved with tons of drama as a stupid college student doing my internship year and have tried my very best at this new(ish) school by staying out of gossip and shit talk. there is this woman (let's call her diane) who is really abrasive to everyone - makes passive and subtle racist and homophobic comments, criticizes and talks about students in front of other students or even worse in front of said student, just overall really hard for me to get along with (an lgbt, pretty liberal, young person). my question is, when is it worth it to speak up? i don't want her to keep saying all these shitty things, and when it offends me, i speak up about it (in the nicest way i can muster - though recently i'm sure i've been coming off as bitchier and bitchier). i'm starting to have an automatic blood-boiling feeling whenever i see her. i avoid her, try not to talk to her, don't go to our shared lunch break in the break room anymore, but she is now talking about me behind my back. i know i've ruined some of my credibility as i have confided with about 4 other teachers who i trust in my frustration even though i'm trying not to stir drama. i don't know what to do, she insults me and my teaching style, mocks my generation and the fact that i'm ""too nice"" and i guess accepting of my students and the changing political climate. it's truly like she just loves clout and is somehow putting my face as the leader of the teacher's who don't like her because i'm the most outspoken of all the other teachers.&amp;#x200b;i didn't wanna make this post ridiculously long, so if you're actually interested i do have more specific details of said racism/homophobia if people are interested.",7,1,Work drama with an older adult.,Adult

4938,"let’s start with some basics you may need to know before you get out into the real world by yourself.**what you need to know*** begin by establishing a deadline for when you want to move out. chances are that neither you nor your parents want you living at home forever. so, first, talk to your parents about both your and their expectations for how long you will be living with them. this will give you an idea of how long you have to save, to budget, to search for a new place, and to prepare for #adulting.* next, you need to create a realistic budget. it is imperative that you budget and save during this time with your parents. some parents might ask you to pay rent while others might not. regardless, begin practicing your budgeting skills by setting aside how much you think you will pay in rent every month plus the amount you would need for bills and any “going out” money. keep in mind that housing, transportation, and food will be the majority of your budget. if you allocate your money properly, you should be able to begin saving for your own place. it is important that you know what you are budgeting for. in other words, are you planning to rent an apartment or are you hoping to purchase your own home? the choice can seem overwhelming; especially if this will be the first time you are living on your own. however, for some people who lived in a rental during college, they might feel ready to buy a place. here is a rundown of important questions to ask, what is included when renting an apartment or house, and the pros and cons of buying.**renting**there are some expenses associated with renting a property you will need to consider. some apartments, houses, or duplexes include utilities in the rent while others do not. in addition, you will need to furnish your new place unless it is pre-furnished. cable and internet are two more expenses you will need to consider when moving into a new apartment. finally, many people get renters insurance which covers damage or loss of property. when you are starting your rental search, look on property management or realtor websites, online listings on sites such as zillow or trulia, ask friends, or go to online forums for the city you live in or are planning to move to and ask for advice on the best places to live on your budget. compare different rental properties before deciding. make a list of what you want in a rental. make sure the properties fit within your budget. take a tour of each  option so you can see them in real life and get a sense of how you would fit into the complex. when touring, and before signing a rental agreement or application, ask whether the rental price will go up if you do not sign by a certain deadline. questions to ask during your rental search:* how much is rent and when is it due? how is it paid? online, in person, by mail , etc. *  what is the length of the rental agreement? *  who pays utilities? how do i set them up? * what amenities are available? are there any extra charges for them? *  what is the policy for guest parking and pets? * who pays for maintenance on my apartment? whom do i contact? *  what are the eviction terms?after you have chosen your apartment, you are ready to sign your rental agreement. you may have to pay a security deposit, which may or may not be refundable at the end of your lease. the property may also ask you to pay first and last month’s rent and/or have a co-signer. the rental company may need additional information such as who is living in the apartment, your income or employment information, rental history, references, and a credit history check. always read the rental agreement and ask any questions you have before you sign.**buying** having a stable house payment allows you to incorporate that expense into your household budget much easier. although it is possible for your mortgage payment to increase over time because of changes in insurance fees and property taxes. if you have a fixed-rate loan, your principal and interest payment will remain set for the life of the loan, which could be as long as 30 years. many people view home ownership as an investment with potential return. in addition to building equity with your monthly mortgage payment, the value of your home could increase in value. finally, home ownership offers the owners a sense of stability and freedom, knowing that you have a place of your own to meet the needs of your family. although buying a home can be very exciting and has many benefits, it is also important to think about the disadvantages associated with home ownership. in many cases, monthly rent at an apartment complex would be less than a monthly mortgage payment. * some of the monthly costs of home ownership include: * your mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. *  in most cases, if you do not have a 20 percent down payment, lenders will require you to pay private mortgage insurance (pmi), which is an additional expense* as a homeowner, you must either make repairs yourself or pay someone to do the work. • often with home ownership, you have reduced flexibility, meaning you will most likely need to sell or rent your house before you can move.*  finally, the opportunity to build equity is generally considered an advantage to home ownership. however, it is important to realize there are no guarantees that a home will increase in value. consider this after carefully weighing the pros and cons of home ownership, there is something else to consider before making your decision to buy or rent: how long you plan to live at the residence. depending on the housing market, it may make financial sense to rent instead of buy. although an advantage to buying is the buildup of equity while you are living there (as opposed to paying rent to a property owner), there are several upfront fees called “closing costs” associated with setting up a mortgage. if you plan to live in a home for a short time, consider how much your home value would need to increase before you would recoup the fees you paid in closing costs, in addition to any real-estate broker fees you would pay when selling the house. because it can be difficult to predict the realestate market, buying doesn’t always make sense. **four c’s of credit***  capital is the amount of cash you have available. as part of the home-buying process, you usually will need capital for the down payment, loan fees, closing costs, reserves, and moving expenses. * capacity is your ability, based on your income, to pay your new mortgage payments as well as your other debts and living expenses. your capacity is calculated based on your current income, income history, future earning potential, and amount owed, including car payments, student-loan payments, credit card accounts (visa, mastercard, etc.), and any other monthly payments.*  credit refers to your credit report and credit history. if you do not have a credit history, you will need to go through the process of building a credit history with receipts and payment slips showing regular monthly payments to property owners and utilities. * collateral will be your new home. the lender will do an appraisal of the home you decide to purchase to determine the value of the house. collateral provides the  lender with security on the loan if the borrower defaults (or does not pay the mortgage). a general rule of thumb to determine how much you would be able to qualify for is 2.5 to 3 times your gross annual income. this is assuming that you are in good financial shape, have a steady income, low debt, a sizeable down payment, and good credit. using this as a guideline, a family earning $60,000 a year, would probably qualify for a loan between $150,000 and $200,000. mortgage lenders often use ratios to determine the maximum loan amount for a borrower. two common ratios used by lenders are housing expense-to-income ratio and debt-to-income ratio. • the housing expense-to-income ratio represents the maximum percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income that can be used for the house payment. twentyeight percent is a common percentage, but different lenders will have different percentage requirements, normally ranging from 25 percent to 33 percent. using 28 percent as an example, if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend each month on your house payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (piti) is $560. ($2,000 \* .28 = $560). • debt-to-income ratio is another number often calculated by lenders. the debt-to-income ratio represents the maximum percentage of the borrower’s gross monthly income that can be used for all debts, including the house payment. typically, to be able to qualify for a loan, lenders will have a preset limit between 36 percent and 41 percent. if your loan has a maximum limit of 36 percent, and if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend on your home mortgage plus all other debts, such as car payment, student loan, etc., is $720. ($2,000\*.36 = $720). &amp;#x200b;want to move out of your parents’ basement? follow this guide to begin budgeting, saving, and planning your move. if you pay off loans, take care of your credit, and weigh your options carefully, you will be living independently in no time at all.&amp;#x200b; [http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/fcs5/fcs5474/fcs5474.pdf?fbclid=iwar3wh\_4ituhslenv0u3zsl4vmwc6mnyb9jfzspxq7iy\_svfsx\_ckylfxsf0](http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/fcs5/fcs5474/fcs5474.pdf?fbclid=iwar3wh_4ituhslenv0u3zsl4vmwc6mnyb9jfzspxq7iy_svfsx_ckylfxsf0)  ^(educational programs of kentucky cooperative extension serve all people regardless of economic or social status and will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, marital status, genetic information, age, veteran status, or physical or mental disability.)",0,1,Moving Out of Your Parents’ Basement: Should You Buy or Rent?,Adult

5269,"so i'm having trouble and looking for some clarification.little backstory for context.house is amazing deal, close to campus, has a garage, and four bedrooms. i fell into a leader position kind of organizing bills and getting everyone together when needed. i pay $100/mo more for the master bedroom. the other three are attending university and a few years younger than i. i've done the college thing and have since taken a few years off and enrolled in a community college trade program. hence i'm stoked on the garage for project work. this type of house, in this hood, for this price, is basically nonexistant anywhere else, so i'd like to keep things as they are, for obvious reasons.now to the issue at hand.anyways, me and one other roommate are more the responsible type, not authoritarian but have already done the party thing and have enough going on, we dont spend as much time at the house. the other two are pretty keen to party, and not as aware of how a symbiotic living situation takes a certain agreement to make it work. their parties have pissed off the neighbors a few times. the neighbors are actually cool people, and have come to me a to discuss the issue, but they have families, and have had problems with previous tenants of this house, causing the previous tenants to get evicted. the landlord rented this house to me and the others with explicit rules to not disturb the neighbors, and if there were any noise complaints we would get the axe. no excuses, no second chances. just be cool, and not get the cops called, not too hard right?the neighbors have come to me after two instances of these rules not being followed, as i am the older and more mature tenant, they talk to me in the hopes of finding some agreement. they have kids in elementary school, and just can not tolerate their kids being woken up by some belligerent college parties. the next time something happens, the authorities will be involved, which means we will be gone, and this amazing opportunity for a living situation will be no more.i've already talked to the offending roommates, but i dont think they understand how good they have it, and how much this living situation means to the other people occupying the house; we are career oriented people, in a great position to live well at low cost. we know the value of what we have, and can't seem to convince the others to care enough to shut the fuck up and take their parties elsewhere. i am on the verge of telling at least one roommate they will not be living there anymore, but the two party roomies seem to feed off each other and if one gets the boot, they will likely take the other with them. this means that if i kick one out, the other will likely leave with them, leaving the two responsible people to pay the entirety of the rent. this is not possible financially for me, or her, so we likely lose the house.what's the move here? how do i convince these party kids how well they have it, when they dont seem to care? i'm doing everything i can, but am so worried about losing the house i have come here, to you great people, in search of solutions. tl dl: two roomies are about to ruin a perfect living situation for four people, and trying to figure out how to make them care enough to change their ways.",3,9,About to lose perfect living situation due to party kids not caring to maintain agreement among neighbors.,Adult

5376,"so i’ve been thinking about my future a lot lately . it started off with me just being curious as to whether it would be possible to get a college degree in less than four years. a couple late night google searches later and i now know the name of two adopted daughters. anyways, i think im a little too young to be worrying about all this but i do think it’s important i have a career choice in mind. i was really big into having a job i’d genuinely enjoy but to cut things short i have a long history of mental health and physical health problems all relating to an unhappy life style and high levels of stress, something i really didn’t want to bring into my adult life. finding a career i didn’t hate sounded like the best way to keep that shit out. but i don’t have many hobbies that i’m passionate about or anything that can be made into a serious career. i know i want to attend college, actually i want to benefits going to college gives you but who doesn’t, but i also know i’m not good at keeping my mental health and school life stable at the same time. so i started thinking about what careers i could get with minimal time in school.i eventually came across dental hygiene. i don’t hate the idea of being a dental hygienist but to be clear it’s not the dream but it’s probably closes thing to it. doing the research it could take just two years to get an associates degree and become a dental hygienist. but then i started thinking about money.i figured if i get a job now and save up until i start college i can easily pay my way through classes and even have some left over. i could take the left overs and put in a savings account. i figured i could work part time on the weekends in order to add to it. the nearest community college that offers associates degree in dental hygiene is a good 2 hours away so i’d be doing online school and living with my parents. i like the idea of building up a savings account as a just in case so i thought what if after i graduate i stay home for another year while i work as a dental hygienist then take that year longs worth of pay checks and add it to the original savings account. i did the math but i can’t be too sure on everything as it’s almost completely out of my control so i did some basic rounding. i’d be able to afford the average rent for 2 bedroom apartment, if i stick to a budget i can afford to also buy new clothes monthly (not likely as i’m not a clothes shopping type and tend to hold onto things until they rip beyond wear), food, renters insurance, car insurance, tv and wifi bills and the other basics and still have extra left over every month. this is if i get a roommate. when doing the math i can probably live in my own no problem but i’d like to be able to continue with the savings account. i’m talking multiple savings account. i factored in how long it’d take to save for all of them and the absolute longest one would take 8-10 years and that’s for a decent 3 bedroom house (preferably with a basement an a decently large backyard but i’m just dreaming). now, i don’t know much about how loans and credit cards work but from what i understand i might be able to get a loan for house from the bank if i have great credit and i swear to you i will. my parents have shit credit and complain about it often, i will do everything in my power to stop that from happening to me.that’s all the money stuff, now here comes to family stuff.to be extremely specific i am a trans man (female to male). i start hormone therapy in a week and that will mostly cut my chances of getting pregnant- which is completely fine by me. there are trans men who choose to carry their own children but i absolutely refuse to. i also suffer from a medical condition that lead to me never having a consistent menstrual cycle and then completely cut off my cycle for 2+ years. i’m guessing the chances of having biological children are extremely rare but i’m okay with this.i’m way too young to decide whether or not i want children but i am mature enough to decide whether or not i want biological children and i don’t. i actually plan on getting a hysterectomy as part of my medical transition. i know i don’t have to carry my own children in order to have biological children but even then i don’t want that. my family has a ton of health issues that i don’t ever want to pass down to a child. but like i said i don’t know if i want kids and i am way too young to decide for sure but in the off chances that i do decide i want kids i have a plan prepared. let me know if i’m wrong in any way. by age 28-30 i will become a foster parent. within that time i’m sure i’ll figure out for sure if i want kids. my research has lead to me believe that adopting from the foster system will either be extremely cheap or basically free. but again- i am way too young but i think it’s a good plan just in case i do decide i want kids. admittedly doing all this research and fantasying as actually made me a little excited.i have a feeling getting babies would be somewhat rare and also not something i think i’d be good at. i think kids over the age of 1 would be my speciality but who knows. i feel really silly saying this but in my head they’re both girls close in age but pretty young. young enough so within the 1 1/2 years that i have to continue fostering them before adoption i can change their names. i always liked the name paisley. the story goes i misread halsey (back when she was getting big, not a fan of that type of my music but for a while she was everywhere) and thought it said haisley, googled the name to see if it was in fact a name and paisley came up and i ended up really liking it. i always kept it in the back of my head for a story character but never used it. i like the name paisley ana for the oldest. while i was day dreaming i also came up with the name ashton, which i know is usually a guys name but i really liked the name ashton rose. i like the idea of a real butchy name with an almost overly feminine middle name (it’s not but in my head rose has always been fairytale sort of name). i’m also fairly certain we’d be able to survive on my pay check alone after the house but i can’t be sure. if by some miracle i can then i’d take the money the government would be paying me to foster the kids and put it into a savings account for them for college or an 18th birthday sort of gift. i don’t know, we’ll have to wait and see i guessand i know, i know, “what if they want to meet their bio parents? what if the parents come looking for them? what will you tell them?”well, i’m not adopted nor am i a foster kid but my bio dad left before i was born and my mom been a real chap about it. my mom has always encouraged the idea of some day meeting him. she never said i had to wait until i was 18 or wait for him to find me. we tried a couple times but never did find him. she talks about him when i ask, tells me about their good times and bad times, things i do that remind her of him.  a lot of the people i know who’s dad are in the same place as mine hate them. wish their dad was dead or wish they could meet him just so they could start a fight and some wish they had been fathered by this mysterious man in their life. i have never been mad at my bio dad, never wondered if my life would have been better had he stayed, never wished him dead. i think maybe im like that because my mom never painted him as a perfect man or a bad man, just a man who made a few mistakes much like everyone else or maybe i’m just extremely passive. either way i wanna teach my hypothetical adopted kids to be the same way. so if i adopt kids i’ll never hide the fact they’re adopted. they’ll know always. if they want to meet their bio parents i’ll help them and if they decide much later they want to use their old name then i’ll be there when they get it legally changed. personally, though i love my step dad, i wish i never changed my last name. i wish i kept it because sometimes it feels like i’m hiding the only part of my bio dad i have. because i also don’t want to seem like a traitor i’ll be changing my last name too when i get older. i will either adopt my mom’s maiden name (with her blessing but she most likely won’t) or use one i’ve had in my mind for a while. i don’t want to feel like i’m talking sides as weird as that sounds. so if they decide they don’t want to “take sides” too that’s fine. anyways, that last part was sort of a little rant. let me know what you think of this plan or if i left something out (credit? i dunno man)- or just

(ended up going to a patient first clutching my shittily screen printed file on the shots i received at the ripe age of 8) so, i don’t have a doctor...i’m aware that i need a psychiatrist to even begin diagnosing me with anything... like...where do i begin? i have my insurance card (its an hra plan so...good benefits? yay?) not sure if the correct process is to schedule an appointment at my previous primary care office and then request mental health diagnoses there? honestly i don’t even know if they have anyone qualified there to do it...sorry this isn’t exactly a direct question i’m quite literally so lost on how to do anything, especially doctor related. my main focus is get my terrible terrible anxiety medicated and possible adult adhd medicated (we can deal with the body image issues and possible bdd/ednos later honestly i just want the days to be easier to get through)...i’m also worried about meeting the psychiatrist and throwing out all these illnesses i think i have like does the poor soul have time for be to speculate over 3 different issues that might not all be in their expertise? who knows! is my anxiety showing? tl;dr: i haven’t had a doctor in a decade, how do i request and set up an appointment with a psychiatrist so i can get this sh*t medicated",1,3,Genuinely have no idea where to start to get mental illnesses diagnosed,Adult

5436,"so i'll be working in texas either as an emergency first responder or an emergency room technician. i believe the average salary in texas for both those jobs are around 33,000-36,000 dollars full time. i believe i can afford maybe 1000-1200 dollars rent per month. if i stretch it i could probably pay up to 1400 dollars max. i'll be living alone.&amp;#x200b;texas has pretty low rent costs and is overall very cheap to live in so i could probably find a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment in houston for 1000-1200 dollars with about 800-1.2k square footage. i'll be living in this apartment for at least 2 years, possibly 3. &amp;#x200b;my living space is very important to me and ideally i'd want to live in a big place so i'd rather go for the 1000+ square footage, but many of those options are 2 bedroom 2 bathrooms instead. what i'm wondering is if this is normal for people who just got out of college. i live in a 550 sqft studio apartment right now (i want to upgrade to a place that has a bedroom) in california where the rent is like 2000 dollars, so a place that's twice the size of my current place for half the price seems like an incredible deal. but i just can't conceptualize in my mind how big a 1000 sq ft apartment would be. if i had 2 bedrooms, i'll probably use one of them as a study space where i can read, work on my music projects, study for possible graduate school exams, etc. which sounds great. but at the same time idk if a 1000 sq ft apartment would be too unnecessarily luxurious for a 22 year old. &amp;#x200b;would it be better for me to go a bit cheaper and get a 750-800 sq ft apartment for 800-900 bucks? pros are that it would save me 200-300 bucks a month. cons are that a big part of me moving to texas is so that i can live in a larger place (my home is very important to me and i really like large living spaces) with a cheaper price, and i don't know if 750-800 sq ft is enough to satisfy that. again i can't really accurately conceptualize how big or small a 750-800 sq ft apartment would be. &amp;#x200b;so i guess what i'm asking is (tl;dr):&amp;#x200b;how big exactly is a 750-800 sq ft apartment space? how big is a 1000 sq ft apartment space? would it be worth it to pay 1000-1200 dollars a month to get the 1000 sq ft apartment space or is 800-900 dollars for a 750-800 sq ft apartment more than enough already?&amp;#x200b;thanks in advance.",8,2,What Square Footage / Rent Price / # of Bedrooms is appropriate for a recent college graduate?,Adult

5465,"hi reddit. first time posting on this subreddit, and looking for some advice. &amp;#x200b;i'm 19f (soon-to-be 20) and seriously considering the idea of moving in to an apartment with my boyfriend (20m) of almost 2 years, along with two of his friends. i have talked to him about moving in together with his sister a few months ago, but neither one of us has brought up the idea since then. a week or two ago, my boyfriend's close friend brought up the idea of them getting an apartment along with another friend. i discussed it with my boyfriend directly, and he and i think that it would be good for both of us to move in together and finally evolve into more responsible adults. to provide a little background on the both of us; at the moment, we both still live with our parents. we both have been living in mentally/emotionally/verbally abusive households for a majority of our lives. his parents are divorced, so he has lived with his mom since then. she is extremely unreasonable and refuses to listen to anything he says. because he doesn't have any idea as to what career or college classes he wants to pursue, she is forcing him out of her house. at the moment, he doesn't have a job, but he is actively looking and applying for jobs to speed up the move-out process. my mother is an alcoholic and has bpd (bipolar personality disorder). in terms of personality and actions, she is very similar to my boyfriend's mom (unreasonable, set in her ways, only listens to herself, always gets what she wants, etc.). i was brought up in a christian-oriented household, but, with my mom being a terrible example, i'm really not that religious. i wouldn't say i'm ex-christian, but i also can't say that i'm an avid follower. her and i have major communication issues, and denounces my attempts in becoming more adult-like and saying that i'm ""too young"" and i have my whole life ahead of me and i have no idea what i'm talking about. i'm the youngest and the only girl in my family, so it feels as though my mom won't ""allow"" me to become an adult and still treat me like a baby. my parents do not know about my boyfriend, either. it's complicated... i have an okay paying grocery store job and can ask for more hours if needed, so i have a pretty steady source of income. i will be applying for company insurance very soon, so i'll have that, as well. (sorry for the long intro) i'm very new to the idea of moving out and finally being independent from my family, so i'm a little lost. most of my friends haven't moved out from their childhood homes either, so i can't ask them for help. i've tried asking my siblings, but they completely ignore how i feel living at home and tell me that i have to ""hang on a little longer."" i'm tired of waiting and i want to get my life started. what are the most basic essentials i need to aquire in order to qualify for renting an apartment? how do i explain to either one of my parents that i'm (possibly) moving soon and i don't want anyone to stop me? how do i convince everyone i'm capable enough to take care of myself and finally be a damn adult?help!",0,1,Moving in with my Boyfriend and Moving on with My Life,Adult
5471,"i had a sheltered childhood. my parents did all of my chores, decided my extracurriculars and tutors, drove me everywhere and did everything for me. they bought me mostly everything i wanted. i never had a job in high school. i never went far from my nice, tree-lined suburban neighborhood. in college my parents paid for everything. i was living in a fantasy world with a nice apartment in a nice city with nice things, going out on nice dinners on weekends. i’m thankful for all of their help and we definitely had to be of a certain income bracket... but their money won’t last forever. now that i’m on my own i’m terribly screwed at my job. i didn’t fully understand that things cost money, and you have to pay for things by getting a job, until i was 19. i didn’t know that you have to pay for water electricity and heat. i didn’t know that every action has consequences and you have to pick up after yourself. i didn’t fully understand all the ways people can lie and manipulate you. i didn’t know that life is really hard. i had these shocking realizations when i was 18-21. not to mention, i only had a few friends because i treated them like free therapy. i literally didn’t know that went ok. and i didn’t understand the basics of social interaction until my 20s. i’ve started my first ever full-time job for a month. i’m a terrible self-starter. i lack the social skills to navigate office politics, and i am not independent at all. i can tell the person i’m working for doesn’t want me working on her projects. i’m just smart enough that i always pull through, right before she can complain about me. my work is just good enough so she can’t get rid of me. i flirted with a guy at work who was just trying to help me get started, because i misunderstood and thought he was interested. yeah, i’m that awkward. my friends got sick of my selfish ways. oh, and i got this job through connections and call my mom multiple times a day to get her to help me. i’m smart enough that i can do most things if i’m taught. but i am very very overly dependent and socially inept and terrible at functioning in life and at work. im hoping that over time it’ll get better. but i can’t help but feel cheated from the independence most people my age have. like, most people knew how to do a lot of these things a lot earlier on because their parents just let them live. i’m ranting now. but has anyone had a similar experience and did they eventually grow up?",1,2,"Overly sheltered and spoiled people, how did you overcome it?",Adult

5487,"there's a lot that goes into this, and i (f 19) really just don't know what to do any more. a tragic family event happened last year that left me basically homeless and with some pretty severe ptsd. i missed my last week of high school, my two graduations, my summer job, lost out on the opportunity of going to college, and probably the biggest hitter was i lost my grandpa who was a father figure to me for 15 years of my life, and my cousin both at the same time. everything would of been okay if i didn't get kicked out by my abusive grandmother (grandfather's wife) who had custody of me. (event happened 5-10-2018 - got kicked out after i turned 18 on the 12th of may). my gf let me move in with her a few weeks later, but she was still living with her parents. between grieving my grandfather, losing everything, the trauma, and my whole life falling apart i fell into one of the worst depressions i've ever been in. 3 months later and my state getting worse i ended things with her, packed a few trashbags and bounced from place to place. my grandmother opened her house back up to me but i wasn't able to handle the abusive tendencies coming back, so i gathered my stuff up once more after reaching out to the only person i really had left.in november of 2018 my brother (21) offered me a place to stay in pennsylvania which was where i was born and was put into foster care before i got placed in ohio. with options short i took the chance packed up my car and took the 9 hour drive from ohio to his house in pa. i arrived 2 days before thanksgiving. i instantly was wondering if i made the right choice. it was a small studio apartment (him and his gf lived in). not clean, mouse crap everywhere, just not a clean and healthy place, also in a very very bad area crime rate wise. keep in mind i lived in a small farming town and i moved to an area with a county population of 1.1 million. while i tried to relax and keep in mind i can build myself up and make a home for myself if i work hard small things started showing through.i started talking to a guy on tinder and we hit it off, he was sweet and we had a lot of good times together. i don't like saying we got serious fast, but we got serious fast. within 3 weeks i was staying at his house and his moms house more than i was at my brothers apartment. this started causing issues between my brother and i. i figured out he was back on cocaine and lost his job, and his license. i gave him over $1500 because they were about to lost the apartment which i still haven't seen a penny back of after momths and months of different plans. tensions were constantly on the rise and it ended up to the point where i was only there once a week. i packed my shit up once more and left and moved in with my bf and his mom temporarily. about 3 weeks later after getting a job and his mom agreeing to be a co-signer i got my first studio apartment at the end of march.i was thrilled. even though i needed a cosigner i was self completely self sufficient and i have a home for the next year, things started to really look up, i was genuinely happy.fast forward to a few weeks ago. things are taking a turn for the worst again. my brother is severely addicted again. got held at gunpoint and called me right after. i can't get how shakey his voice was out of my head, (which is screwing with my ptsd and nightmares) and is actively destroying his relationship and it's falling back on me. they're asking for month long stays which i can't risk because their names aren't on the lease. out of pure frustration i went off on my brother. nothing crazy was said, just that i was at a loss and with everything going on i can't mentally handle everything as bad as i felt.. and i blocked him. he sent me a text (one thing i forgot to block him on) essentially telling me ""wish i never bought you out here"" telling me that if anything happens to my ""fa**ot worthless boyfriend not to come crawling back"" because i spit in his face and i'm the most inconsiderate heartless person he's ever met.i'm working 40 hrs full time a week as an it contractor with no option for over time and people keep getting cut off left and right and i have no idea if i'm next. i've been applying to places with no word back except one job that would leave me off worse. i live paycheck to paycheck and have virtually no money to fall back on. i just got food poisoning or something last week.. but it turned into some insane chest pains and tightness the next day. it felt like i was being stabbed in the chest and i could barely get a 3rd of a normal breath in. i had no insurance and thought i was completely out of luck i kept getting turned away. my boyfriend's mom took me to a charity er and after an ecg, chest xray, blood tests, and other lab tests everything came back fine and they told me it's just anxiety. they offered me a shot for it but i turned it down, i just wanted to go home and sleep. i've had major depressive episodes and a history of mental health issues but never really thought it was that bad. i need to get back into therapy but with no insurance it's making it impossible. i contacted the children and youth for the county i was a foster kid through (i live in the county next to it currently) but no one is returning my calls, and i can't miss work but my work hours are the only days they are open. i figured they would be able to give me guidance or help me out because i should qualify for some sort of state insurance or assistance or something. so that's one thing on my plate right now, this large bill i'm going to have if i can't get this figured out.my boyfriend is going to college over 3 hours away mid august, and that is also starting to really hit me. i got attached very fast which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but i have 0 friends. i know absolutely no one in this area or know how to go about making friends in ways that doesn't cost.. again i'm broke. i'm already struggling with the idea of not having him around that much any more.. he's really been my rock the past 7 months. i cannot give that man enough credit for all he has done for me. i've never loved anyone as much as i love him. i try to keep in mind he has friends and a social life and is trying to get time in with his friends and family and work before he goes but i'm very lonely and very worried about how i'm going to handle not having him around.. or if him and i will even be able to keep this relationship going and healthy with him being so far away. that, and the fact that when he goes to college i have absolutely no one again and i don't want to feel that again.my future is just starting to look really bad again and i need help with figuring something out in the next 2 months, or i really don't know what i'm going to do or how i'm going to handle this. i'm so so fucking sad and lost, and all of what i'm going on about now isn't even the half of it. i'm tired of beind sad and depressed, but i

5790,"hi all. posting here because i feel pretty lost, and like i need to change some things in my life. i’m graduating from college in may, but i’m feeling extremely unprepared to enter the real world post-college. here’s a brief description of some areas of my life, to give y’all an idea of where i’m at:academic/careermy undergrad majors are music and theology, with a philosophy minor. i’m considering law as a career path and i’ve applied to several law schools, but at this point it’s unlikely that i’ll start law school right away- based on my gpa and lsat score i probably won’t be able to get into a great school, or get scholarships (going to law school for close to nothing is my goal, for reasons explained below). it would be much better for me to work for a year, save money, retake the lsat, and reapply in a year or two. i’m also interested in sacred/liturgical music, as well as music education, and i have some experience in those fields, but i’m not interested in doing more education for that right now. i don’t have a job lined up but i’m working on applications for pre-law positions at legal firms. i should have a job by now, and it’s totally my fault for not being proactive in the job search. this is my top priority atm.financial:i worked throughout high school and college, and spent all of my savings on college tuition (my parents and i split the cost of tuition). i am very anti-debt and wanted to avoid it in college, but between all of my savings and my parents’ contribution i still ended up needing to take student loans. upon graduation i’ll have about $1500 in savings, and $9k in debt. my parents are willing to buy me a car worth about 5k- which i will definitely need to commute to a job or law school- and then i’ll pay them back once i’m working. they also pay for pretty much everything else for me. family/living situation:since i’m currently broke and unemployed, i will have to move back home after college. my parents are able to help me out financially and are quite generous, and i’m really grateful for that. however, they’re also classic helicopter parents. well meaning, but way too involved in my life. they’ve always tried to do things for me that i should do myself, and want to have a say in every aspect of my life. living at home with them is difficult to say the least... i constantly feel stifled, like i don’t have space to make my own decisions and have my own voice without being openly confrontational towards them, which i never do because i hate confrontation. part of this is definitely my fault, because i’ve never been that motivated. i know sometimes i need someone pestering me to get me off my butt and start being responsible. but they also “helicopter” my older sister, who is extremely motivated on her own (she left home as soon as she could). i think maybe the whole thing is a vicious cycle: they try to be over-involved and push me to do what they think i should, without letting me fail or succeed for myself, and i end up not getting things done because i’m resentful of being told what to do, and i fail to accomplish what i need to, which leads them to “helicopter” me even more. i’m not making an excuse for my own shortcomings; i know it’s my own fault for being lazy. but the lack of space and independence doesn’t help that; their over-involvement makes it difficult to feel capable of being a responsible adult.so, the point of all this is that i’m tired of feeling like a child being provided for and directed. and i’m tired of failing myself and not living up to my potential. i want to be independent, financially and otherwise, and not have to have my parents as a safety net for my own lack of drive and motivation. my goal is to move out asap, and become self-reliant in all areas of my life. i guess the question i have for y’all is, what are the things i need to do to reach independence? i know getting a job and saving money is the most important thing. but in addition to that, i’m not used to taking care of any adult responsibilities: bills, doctors appointments, insurance, etc. i also have a lousy work ethic, but i really want to change that, and i’ve been trying to. i know this post is a mess (just like me lol). but if anyone has advice, it would be so appreciated. thanks in advance to all you lovely people.tl;dr- i’m graduating college, and i’m broke, unemployed, and gonna be living with my helicopter parents- largely due to my own lack of motivation and mistakes. i want to become independent and move out asap, but i need specific tips for how to do that.",1,5,About to graduate from college and my life is kind of a mess.

5838,"i'm 20, f, and southeast asian. right after i graduated college, i started working for a menial job for almost 9 months. i just live in an apartment near my parent's house and pay my own utilities, never asked for money from them ever since i started earning. i felt the need to help my parents financially since they had really bad financial problems due to lack of planning for a sustainable budget. i offered to pay the house's electric bill, the allowance money for my two younger sisters who are still in high school, and maintenance medicine for my autistic sister. my older sister also helps by paying the house's water bill and half of the budget for our family car loan.however, my mother still tries to borrow money from both my sister and i. she always tells us she needs it to pay for the groceries and for some car repairs (she works as a family driver). worse part, she promises to pay it back but she never does. we just got used to it and never asked her when she could pay us back since she would just tell us she doesn't have enough money yet. meanwhile, my father only earns enough money to pay for the other expenses and he owes money to some of my relatives too so he also has to pay them back  in the first place, i volunteered to pay those expenses i mentioned since i know my mother has this tendency of constantly borrowing money from me and my elder sister   since we were in high school (we try to save money as much as we can from allowance and she knows we have the money so she borrows them and never paid it back).i honestly don't know how to deal with her since i feel like i already pay enough contribution to help them and i have my personal budget too. when she keeps borrowing money, my savings are constantly decreasing since that's the only part of my budget where i could get money to lend her.it's part of the asian culture to have this sense of gratitude to your parents once you already earn money. but i'm honestly stressed about it, since i want to keep my personal budget in place and my mother constantly borrowing money doesn't help. at the same time, i feel like i would be too selfish if i stopped lending her money.i want to hear honest opinions. i'm a little overwhelmed right now.",20,1,Should I feel obligated to pay money back to my parents?,Adult

5893,"	hello ladies and gentlemen! this one is going to be a doozy so buckle  up! as i was brainstorming through ideas of how to be of most assistance  to you all, i tried to think about what skills or ideas had the most  profound impact on my life as i started my 20s. with zero hesitation,  gaining control over my finances was the first thing that came to mind.	unfortunately, in school, there seems to be a shortage on quality  personal finance experience. many people enter adulthood with zero idea  of how to support themselves without help from the bank of mommy and  daddy (bmd). i was one of these people. of course, i understood general  concepts like “i can’t afford to buy this new car”, “don’t open a credit  card and immediately max it out (i did it anyway)”, or “it’s good to  have some savings (but not mandatory, right?)”. but i never really  minded any of that or knew exactly how to implement it. # what not to do: my experience with money	my sophomore year of college, i opened a credit card to pay the  security deposit on a house with my then-girlfriend of 3 years. six  months later, we broke up and i moved out into another house with some  friends. with my name on the lease of the original house and no one to  take my place, i quickly took on two rents when i was struggling to pay  one and i had $0 in savings. i used my inheritance from my grandmother  to survive. this is the exact scenario i hope to help you all avoid  through this series of posts on finances!	but worry not, this is a story of triumph not defeat. i managed to work  my ass off and stay afloat. my finances were awful for the next year,  but nothing near what they were during that 6 month period. in my senior  year, i found the holy grail of finance. enter ramit sethi’s i will teach you to be rich.  although the corny title sounds rather scammy, i had heard the book  suggested on a variety of podcasts and, finally, caved after hearing tim  ferriss’ interview with ramit ([episode 371](https://tim.blog/2019/05/07/ramit-sethi/)). this post references several of ramit’s concepts from the book and i high, highly, highly recommend investing in it. 	that’s enough about me. let’s dive in to the nitty gritty of part i:  building a budget.  we’re going to break it down into 4 easy steps:&amp;#x200b;1. building your idea of a rich life2. building your current budget3. cutting spending4. creating financial goals# your rich life and conscious spending	before we bust out the actionable steps to get your finances in order,  we need to cover two concepts from ramit’s book: living your rich life  and conscious spending. i’ll just be scratching the surface on these  concepts while ramit takes a much deeper dive in the book. in short,  living your “rich life” is all about the fact that there is no reason  every one of us can’t be rich or enjoy the things we want to enjoy. that  means if you want to spend $200 on a jacket, go for it (with the right  system in place). if going out and spending $300 on drinks at the bar is  a part of your rich life, we’ll put it into your plan. this isn’t going  to be another post telling you to stop buying your $7 venti, non-fat,  organic, paleo, mocha, java, frappe with stevia and two pumps of  sugar-free vanilla.  as long as you identify what is truly important to  you, there is no reason for you not to have it. 	the counter to this is “conscious spending”. you deserve to be able to  spend however much money you want on the things that mean most to you.  but to do that, you much cut back relentlessly on the things that don’t  matter to you. example: if your $12 post-workout smoothie 5 days a week   is what matters to you, but you could care less what you workout in,  then stores like walmart, bargain hunt, and tj maxx are where you need  to be hunting for deals on clothes, not nike. and you need to be  utilizing as few outfits as possible. as we go into the initial process  of building a budget and building your “rich life”, you need to keep  both concepts in mind.**before  we move on, get out your phone, laptop, or a pen and paper and, at the  top, write “my rich life”. underneath, write down everything that is a  part of your “rich life” no matter how silly it may seem. once you’ve  done that, we’ll move on to building your budget.**# building your budget	if you’ve ever sat down a tried to build a budget before, you’ve likely  heard to shoot for a 50/30/20 split. that means fifty percent of your  income is going to fixed costs like rent, gas, groceries, insurance,  phone bills, etc. thirty percent is going to your wants like going out  with friends, video games, movies, books, and other dispensable items.  finally, the last twenty percent is your savings, both short- and  long-term. overall, this is a great guide. but it doesn’t fit everyone. 	when i first started getting my finances in order, i took my income and  applied the percentages to see how much i could spend in each category.  after i took out for rent, utilities, car payment, and gas, i had $50  left each month to spend on groceries each month. that’s $12.50/week for  those of you busting out a calculator. if you can eat healthy,  convenient food for $12.50/week, please let me know how. between school,  fraternity leadership, work, a relationship, and my family, i had  little time to prep all my food every week or bargain hunt cheap  veggies. so i adjusted the percentages a little to fit my lifestyle. 	after looking at all my expenses, my budget looked a little more like  60-65/15-20/20. while you’re still in school or just entering the  working world, it’s okay for your spread to look like this. as you take  steps forward in your career, you’ll be able to get closer and closer to  50/30/20 or even surpass it with 40/35/25. but you have to be honest  with yourself about what matters (remember “conscious spending”).**to  get an idea of where you’re at budget-wise, you have two options: if  you’re a card user (debit or credit), you can retroactively track all  your expenses from one month and see what you’ve got going on. if you’re  a cash user, track your next month of spending by keeping all receipts  and using either an excel sheet or an app like mint or clarity.**# cutting spending	it’s time to get ruthless. if you’re anything like me, after putting  together your budget and using mint or clarity, you saw how  unsustainable your financial situation is. remember when we discussed  spending extravagantly on the stuff that matters and cutting back  relentlessly on the stuff that is less relevant? it’s time to be honest  with ourselves again.	 when you examine your spending tracker, it’s likely something sticks  out to you and make you think, “i spend that much money on that!?!” but  don’t worry, we’re not going to immediately jump back to medieval times  and live with the lights off, bathing in a nearby creek. we’ll take baby  steps. 	first, identify your biggest source of unnecessary spending and set a  reasonable goal for spending less on it in the next 2-4 weeks. if you  found that buying a case of beer every few days is setting you back, cut  back to one case for the week. then one 12-pack for the week. all the  while, experimenting with other, cheaper beers. don’t get me wrong, i’m a  craft beer guy too. but if you’re pounding 24 every few days, you’re  past the point of drinking as a hobby.	another good place to cut back here and there is groceries. experiment  with various recipes and try buying mainly whole, real foods found on  the outer rim of the store, not in the center aisles. invest in an instant pot  ($60-$80) and cook whole meals in there for the week. by buying large  quantities of whole foods and cooking for the whole week, you’ll feel  more accomplished and healthier which leads to more energy and  confidence. you’ll also save a lot of money on groceries and food by not  eating out as often.**before  moving on, try out the steps above. identify your biggest source of  unnecessary spending and come up with a plan to slowly cut back.** 	**also, hop on**

**and find a few cheap, easy recipes that sound incredible and make them over the next few weeks.**# setting goals&amp;#x200b;![img](lrzelh45yyh41)	if you haven’t checked out my [post](https://20s.life/f/new-year%e2%80%99s-resolutions-it%e2%80%99s-ok-to-restart)  on making s.m.a.r.t goals, i highly suggest you hop over there after  finishing this! it is a much more in depth look at how to properly build  goals so that they get done. 	when it comes to building financial goals for cutting spending, there  are two approaches: the big stuff and the small stuff. focusing on the  big stuff means cutting expenses and organizing your budget based on the  large expenses. this means figuring out how to save money on your rent,  cable, car, etc. focusing on the small stuff is more dialed in. this  looks like cutting out a cup of coffee each week, not adding queso to  your chipotle, or buying reusable ziploc bags (bonus: this one’s much  better for the environment). 	while, the small stuff is very effective and comes with it’s own  bonuses. it can also be very taxing on the psyche. having 100 different  things to remember when shopping that end up saving you $50/month is not  a great return on investment (roi). if you choose to take the small  stuff route, try finding one-and-done options like the reusable ziploc  bags or investing in a coffee pot to make your own coffee.	 focusing on larger expenses will cut more off of your monthly  expenditure and, typically, only has to be done once. this looks like  negotiating a decrease in your rent by offering to not smoke or have  animals. or getting a decrease on your cable bill by finding a lower  option and asking your current company to match the price (pro tip: it  is much more expensive for companies to get a new customer than it is  for them to keep a current one; they’ll want to keep you). ramit has  several scripts for these exact conversation on his [website](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/blog/how-to-make-money-fast/).	it is also important to set savings goals, the important part in these  goals is to approach them systematically and not get overwhelmed by the  size of them. for example, thebalance.com recommends having 1x your  income saved for retirement by the age of 30. with the average income of  people in their 20s being around $40,000, this can be pretty  intimidating. but let’s break it down. that’s $4,000 a year for our 20s  which is $333/month. this rate is much more manageable. i know it sounds  impossible for those of you still in school or working part time, but  as your income increases your savings rate will increase. do not think  that you need to be saving $333/month at 21 lest you be screwed when you  hit retirement!	be sure to be realistic and time-oriented. save enough that you can  live your rich life, but also put a “due-by” date on your goals. for  more steps regarding setting up goals that stick, i highly recommend  checking out [my post on s.m.a.r.t. goals](https://20s.life/f/new-year%e2%80%99s-resolutions-it%e2%80%99s-ok-to-restart) or searching youtube for a video on s.m.a.r.t. goals.	once you have cut spending and are saving all you can, the only  direction to go is up, meaning increasing your income. there are a  multitude of ways to do this from negotiating a raise, to finding a  higher paying job, to starting a side hustle. i’m going to cover all of  this in a separate post as the information is way to broad to be covered  here.# conclusion	gaining control of your finances is no meager task. it can be scary,  stressful, or feel impossible. but the freedom that comes from it can be  life changing. if you’re feeling overwhelmed, just hang with me here.  start with the few steps in this post and keep an eye out for the rest  of the guide. we’re going to cover it all: credit, increasing income,  retirement, all of it. 	once you’ve applied even just the simple steps from this one post,  you’ll already be light years ahead of anyone else who is still being  controlled by their finances. 	our 20s are tough. but only if we do it alone. let’s figure them out together. &amp;#x200b;tldr: budgeting should be easy. you just need to be honest about what's important and cut back relentlessly on what is less important. additionally, setting goals will keep you on track and accelerate your progress. this is all information that can be found on a post at my site: [20s.life](https://20s.life)",0,1,Gaining control over your finances,Adult

6136,"how do i go about moving out with a controlling mother? tldr at bottom, this is a lengthy post.i’m 22f and live at home. i moved back home last december after graduating from college. i work at a hospital making $17.30 an hour and i don’t pay anything to live at home, so i’m lucky enough to save all of my money (especially while i’m self-isolating and don’t go anywhere anyway). i get paid weekly and i usually bring home close to $500i don’t really have any major bills besides my cell which is $104 a month (i’m financing my phone), i do have disney+ which is $7 a month, and i did rack up about $2.3k in credit card debt because of textbooks so in total my monthly payments add up to $88. i don’t have a car because i always take public transportation to work, and i feel like i will be okay not having one for a while. definitely helps me save on insurance, so that’s not a problem for me. other than that, that’s really it for bills.with this whole coronavirus stuff, i doubt i’ll be able to find an apartment anytime soon. i check from time to time and there’s nothing really available in my price range ($1300) at this moment. my boyfriend and i have been together for two years and we have been looking to find a place hopefully by the end of the summer, i hope that still happens but if not we are willing to wait it out. now, i live at home with my mom, dad, and older sister. my mom is the problem, but i do want to reiterate my mom is not a terrible person. she has always helped me and supported me in every way possible and i love her dearly, but she still tries to control every aspect of my life. my dad doesn’t care what i do; he let me go as soon as i turned 18, so he’s not an issue at all. my sister can be a problem sometimes, she acts like my mom but i don’t let her bother me. anyway, my mom always tries to micromanage my life, tell me what to do with my relationship even though she has never spoken to or met my boyfriend, she even told me not to tell my dad because we were together while i was in school and to this day i haven’t told him, tell me i need to do this or that because i’m an adult and she will constantly blow in my face that she always gave me everything. for example, a few days ago i did my sisters hair. i was on my feet for like an hour, i have knee problems so i was in pain after. my mom wanted me to do her hair too, i jokingly said no. she had an attitude for the entire day, complained to my dad, then the next day my dad lectured me about not stressing her out she gave you everything so be nice and all this other stuff. i just can’t because my mom is the type to not say no anyway because she feels bad if she does. so i don’t get it. she said she would help me buy a car, but i know for a fact she would 100% blow it in my face if we ever got into it. i love her but holy shit don’t do something nice for me and then turn around and throw it at me.so, here’s my issue with moving out. my mom is under the impression that at 22, i’m too young to live on my own. that after college you’re supposed to live with your parents. my mom thinks there’s this rule book to life and you absolutely have to abide by it otherwise you’ll be screwed in life or whatever. i feel like because my other siblings (theres 8 of us total and i’m the youngest of them all, 5 are my half siblings from my father) have somehow in someway screwed up in their life, when it comes to me my mom is trying to literally shove me on her version of the correct path. i know for a fact my mom would not approve of me moving in with my boyfriend before marriage, but i personally believe that before any type of commitment (even engagement) you should see how you and your so live together. i personally don’t want to be excited about getting married, move in with him, and then find out that we cannot live together. i’d rather find out sooner or later.so, my boyfriend and i are starting to save up for a security deposit, first and last, and a couple more months of rent just to be on the safe side. i haven’t told anybody my plans just yet, i want to make sure i have the money saved up first so that way i can at least say i am financially secure enough to have my own place. my boyfriend has furniture from his apartment that he’s living at now, so i’m not too worried about that part. i feel like if we can at least have a bed and storage, we will be okay for the first month or two.i feel like when the time comes, it’s gonna cause problems between my mom and i. my mom would definitely call up some family members and complain to them and try and have them change my mind. i don’t want to deal with the backlash because it’s nobody else’s business. i’ve asked for advice among my friends who have been in similar situations, and they’ve all pretty much said that their parents got over it, it’s your life, you need to just do it because you’re an adult and they can’t control you or tell you what to do anymore. any advice?tl;dr: my mom tries to micromanage my life and i want to move out with my boyfriend, but it’s gonna cause backlash and problems that i don’t want to deal with.",4,1,"Posted this in r/movingout but nobody commented, figured I’d bring it here.

6712,"this is pretty long so i'll put a tl;dr at the bottom. anyways, i'm in a bit of a situation and i'm looking for advice on how to go about it. sorry of this is the wrong sub to post it in, but it's the best one i can think of for this situation.a bit of background: over the summer, i was in a bit of a weird situation. i was three month out of college without a job in my field (with the pandemic being in it's height) and unemployment benefits were ending. i also didn't have a license to drive so my options were pretty low. luckily there was an outdoor mall across the street of where i was living and i managed to find a job at a particular store there (don't want to mention what store it is). for the sake of the story, we will call this the og job. the pay was absolute garbage at $11 an hour (minimum wage where i live is $10 an hour) and hours were very variable (i could work 25 hour a week or 35 hours a week and nothing was ever consistent in the schedule) but it was a job and paid the bills so i kept it. fast forward a few weeks later, i got a license and a car. i made mention to my manager nonchalantly at the og job that i was looking for a full time job because i wanted to find one that was more consistent. (i felt comfortable doing this because this manager was very personable and gave me life advice). at the end of my shift my manager pulled me aside and asked me when i was going to start looking for jobs and i told her asap. she essentially said she really wanted to keep me there and promoted me to temporary key holder where i got a $0.50 raise even though i had only worked there a month and a half at that point.about a month later i moved 30 minutes away from the og job, making my commute 30 minutes there and back. my schedule was still really variable at the og job and my rent at my new place was higher, so i needed another job. i found one at a retail store making $18 an hour working pretty much 40 hours a week. i still kept the og job, mostly because i liked being around the people i worked with.in november, things started to take a toll on me. i was getting stressed out about having to drive thirty minutes to an from the og job every day  in addition to working my other job. it didn't help that there was a supervisor there who just absolutely got on everyone's nerves and made them feel stupid for asking a question even if they just started. i was thinking about putting in my two weeks at this point. but then, the manager that i liked from the og job said they found a full time job and that they would be leaving and i felt bad about quitting at the same time. so i stuck through it for another two weeks until i actually put in my two weeks.i originally talked to the assistant manager and told him i was putting in my two weeks, but he told me that he couldn't do anything about it because he wasn't the store manager. however, this day just happened to be the new managers first day. she had experience managing a different store in the same chain, so she kind of jumped right onto things. when i td her i wanted to put in my two weeksshe told me that i was a nessecary part of the store (or at least that's what the old manager told her) and asked if there was anything she could do to keep me there. i explained the situation of having to drive an hour every day to get to and from work and already having a second job. i also mentioned i needed more money for me to keep staying there. her suggestion was to have me work less days a week, with longer shifts but apparently couldn't do anything about money. foolishly i accepted. a few days later, the district manager came on and apparently my store manager of the og job made mention to them that i wanted to quit. so, the district manager told me (in a joking manner i think) that of she doesn't ever want to hear that i'm putting in my two weeks again and then gave me a coupon to go pick out a free product from the store for ""all my hard work"" (essentially like a 'thanks-for-staying' gift).well, now i want to quit for real this time. management has taken an absolute turn for the worst to the point where there will be three upper level management people working and myself working and all three of them will go in the back, leaving me to ring up and sell stuff to 40 customers at a time. corporates expectations are stupid and unattainable, and yet me and the lower level staff get yelled at when we don't achieve it. i honestly feel like i'm just being used at this place and that they're just walking all over me. plus, me driving an hour there and home and only working 18 hours a week (if i'm lucky) at $11.50 an hour is really just not worth the time and stress that i put into the og job. especially when i have a better paying job that is a 10 minute drive from my house. how do i put in my two weeks without them guilt tripping me or roping me back in? do i just upright quit and walk out or do i put on my two weeks? i am absolutely done with this job and am still not sure if i want to use them as a reference.tl;dr: got a job over the summer to help pay bills. pay was/is horrendous and hours were not stable, but it was across the street and i couldn't drive so i kept it. casually told my manager i was looking for more consistent better paying jobs, and they promoted me to temporary key holder to keep me there. eventually got a license and a car, and moved 30 minutes away. found a better paying job. few weeks later, i was stressing about the job and wanted to quit. verbally told the manager i was putting in my two weeks because of the drive i had to take and the other job i had and she asked if working less days and longer shifts would help. i agreed and stayed. manager told the district manager that i had put in my two weeks and the district manager told me (jokingly) to never put in my two weeks again and gave me a coupon for a free item in the store. management has become significantly worse, and i feel being used. i want to leave. what's the best way to do this without being roped back in?",2,1,"How to quit a job that I've tried to quit before, but keep getting roped back into",Adult

i don’t know if this is appropriate as a housewarming gift, but since our new apartment is literally ten minutes away from his work, he was considering using my bike to get there, but i’m worried it might be too small or that he’d just prefer to have his ownplease feel free to leave any comments or suggestions on nice things i could get him! i'm happy to answer any questions or make clarifications as well. he’s so strong and such a hard worker, so to see him struggle this past year has made me all the more motivated to do something nice for him and let him know that he's appreciated and that things are going to be okay.side note: i’ve decided against throwing a full-on housewarming party because you know, the pandemic. i considered maybe inviting one or two of his good friends over for a simple dinner, but i’m not really quite sure if that’s a great idea or what to expect (do we give them an apartment tour? do they bring gifts? what do people even do at housewarming parties?). i figured that a gift from me (and my friend who gifted the air fryer) and maybe facetiming some family and friends would suffice. if you have any suggestions for how i could organize something nice as well, please let me know!thank you in advance for all your help :)",7,1,what can I get my dad as a housewarming gift?,Adult

6776,"hey all. i'm a 24 year old female and back in september i moved out of my parent's house after 23 years of living in the same childhood home my entire life. i currently share a two bedroom apartment with my roommate about 20 minutes from where i grew up. needless to say, i'm basically living the same life i grew up in, just on my own. i've been dreaming of moving out of illinois, where i'm from, for as long as i could remember. my only failed attempt was going to college for two semesters in wisconsin before realizing i hated wisconsin even more. anyways, my point is that when my lease is up in august i'm highly considering moving somewhere new. i'd love to go west. maybe salt lake city or bend, oregon. technically, california is first on my list but i'd never make that happen on 30k a year.the problem is that i have no *real reason* to run so far from home. i don't have a job to follow, i don't have a person to follow. there's nothing chasing me out of town. in fact, i think i'm just too comfortable where i am now. i love having my family close, i live with my best friend, and i work as a preschool teacher in typical 9-5 fashion. **have you ever moved states simply for the thrill of it?** i don't know why i feel like i need the justification. maybe i just need someone to tell me it's possible and worth it. why do i feel like i have to stay where my parents chose to build their lives? of course, i understand that in order to make it happen i need to save money and find a job and a place to live. i get the logistics of it all. i just can't push myself to make such a crazy change for the hell of it.",41,1,Have you ever left your home state just for the thrill of it?,Adult
6786,"another year comes to an end and we move another year closer to death. its rather amusing, the concept of death lurking around any unspecific ordinary situation, the most consistent thing about this year has been the inconsistency that it had brought along. most of us entered (subjective to my social circle) 2020, with an amazing spark and outlook towards life. i personally progressed so much last year, that it made a world of difference to my personality and holistically to my existence. i took a leap of progress in terms of getting over the fear of commitment, academic fluency, the equilibrium between the flexibility and rigidity of my stance in different situations that i land myself into. yes, being accountable for my mistakes due to poor reasoning and choices has also come to an acknowledgment. coming from a close knitted nuclear family, it is extremely hard for me to make choices on my own which concerns my interest without upsetting or overlooking anybody’s feelings and requirements. this makes a cocoon of safety but at the same time, it creates a permanent and a hard to break out structure that does not allow me to afford taking small decisions about my life such as making impromptu trips with friends, taking a break from socializing for mental well-being, asking for privacy and staying out after 10.  following that context, i seemed to have finally came out of that cocoon because i moved to another state for college, rented my own flat and managed my monthly expenses; all of this gave me a little taste of liberty which was never experienced.my own room with no-one to knock on, with a door which can be latched, my own time for meals, my choice of meals, random night-outs, late-long night drives around through the quietest time of one of the busiest cities in the country i.e., new delhi.  sure, yes, living on coffee and consuming untimed meals does not really depict an ideal individual behavior, but i personally believe that on a journey of finding oneself, getting lost is an essential milestone. i started liking myself for the person i was becoming, i managed my own finances, i dealt with tight situations myself, i made my own decisions, and i was accountable for them. i guess i could ponder on this later xd.this random piece of text is an attempt to look around the events of 2020 and my observation of people over the internet. after we were forced to head back home from our colleges and jobs towards our hometown. it felt safe and sound because of all the chaos and death going around in the world; people were cherishing this lovely period as their best friends were in town and i think its safe to assume that it was the golden period of this year because of all the family members being present again under the same roof. then came the time where time stood still, everyone had heard all the crazy stories about everyone, there was no gossip left to forward, no celebrity breakups and no-good news from anywhere. what kept us sane was the internet- instagram, facebook, youtube and for those who could afford it- drugs, alcohol, and video games. you know how they say that everything is temporary? every drug has its effect limited to a time frame, then comes the downer and then sobriety hits home. people pursued old interests, picked up new hobbies, learnt instruments, dance etc. but humans being humans, they got tired of it and end of the day, everything remains bland and grey.what happened to the most energetic section of all the population demographic? the students eh? millions of them did not get a farewell, did not get to say goodbye to their best friends, and did not graduate. instead, they got their degrees through e-mails and whatsapp, universities shifting their lifelike boring classes to a screen making the education totally useless. i mean no disrespect to the teachers but if both the teachers and the students were asked the question of “how much were you able to actually teach /learn and how much of it do you think is effective/applicable in real life?”, my assumption could be wrong, but the assumption is a simple no, no we have not learnt shit, we do not like schools/colleges on computers and mobile phones but i guess itttiisswutitizzz.let us come back to the question of what happened to people, to enjoy the littlest moments in life, they have started measuring how big of a little moment they are having and how is it better than the person they meet every now and then. the question of who has more money and drip has become more important than who might need help or who might be the person on the verge of a breakdown. people follow these trends on tiktok and instagram where they must do weird shit to their bodies, dance on music they do not know the words to, swear in front of their respected individuals, lie about their mental well-being to seem edgy, act politically woke without studying an ounce of facts and so much more. i understand that people find pleasure in the littlest of things and moments but let us understand something together okay?we are living in an era where social validation has become more valuable than any currency in the forex market, it is something that an individual of every race, gender and age is feeding upon without any boundaries to content and risk of tremendous hatred hidden behind the curtains of anonymity. this trend culture has made people sell different parts of themselves to a mass of people who are there on the internet to consume media but are so fragile when it comes to content selection that if they do not like your voice, hair, eyebrows or even your size of nose, they will skip ahead. every alternate video is the same repetition of a joke revolving around one ancient subject… yeah you guessed it- sex! okay buddy, big deal, you have a huge penis, okay you have a small one, size does not matter, boobs are funny, cleavage is scandalous, you cheated on your significant other and that is cool because you are pretty and that does not make you any less of a good person because #fucknegativity.  people have become mean; they will not help another person if the other person does not have a favor they can return later.  now let’s come to what happened to music, let me be short with this one an quote some examples here:-real hot girl shitah(and if the beat live, you know lil ju made it)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odyody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (mwah)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah ah)ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odybody crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah, yeah)body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (mwah)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odyody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick rideleave it to the double thick thighs, twin sistersdrop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted upshe get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money upslide, slide in the bentley truck-a, the wraith truck-ayour bestie is a dick sucker, i big dub heras-salama-lama alaykum, you big hateryou nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussybring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussygive me everything you got for this wet-ass pussyhonestly, what the fuck happened back there?

7075,"i'm sorry this is long. i'm asking for advice relative to the experience i've had so far.my boyfriend and i need to move out of his parents' house. living here is immensely stressful especially due to his mother's mental illness. we desperately need advice or affirmation or something because we are lost. we've been trying to figure this out since march and different problems have come up.**apartments here**we both currently attend college full-time (year round, online) and work part-time in dead-end retail jobs. right now, we make enough for a very cheap rental apartment (studio &lt;$750) due to our state's high minimum wage. there are a couple of these in our city. we avoid about half of them due to dangerous neighborhoods. most places around us are $1000 at minimum (this is more of a ""second home"" tourist town). i have an email inquiry out right now about touring a place for $600 in the next city over. the last potential tour call i got was right before the quarantine and i had to pull out of that.our city is very depressed. it is one of the poorest in the state. there are only a handful of stores here. the population feels mostly 60+ years old (we are in our 30s). we have to drive an hour and a half in either direction to go to a mall or reach anything remotely relevant to our interests. additionally, although perhaps less importantly, i want to have a dog, but no where around us under $1500 allows pets. all of this makes moving within our current area a hard pill to swallow.**trying to move out-of-state**we *want* to leave the city and move out of state. we spent our entire quarantine researching states and cities, picking one specific place, and applying to full-time jobs in that city. the minimum wage there is federal minimum, but there are many more apartments for around $600. no place was hiring or interested in us. we were applying to essential businesses like groceries as well as non-essentials. i imagine part of this was due to quarantine business loss/hour cuts and part due to the fact our resumes listed an out-of-state address.then, i started having sudden health problems. it has gotten to the point where i am wearing a heart monitor for a month with various follow-up appointments at 6-8 weeks, and i have made neurological and other misc. appointments to try to find out what is wrong with me. these appointments have us pinned us down to our current area for the next 2-3 months.we thought a long time about whether it would be better to stay with his parents for a couple more months (or longer, depending on if i get a diagnosis) or if we need to move urgently. we decided to give up on moving out of state look for places in our area again, within the parameters of our current part time wages. so, basically, go back to the top of the post. this is why we are so lost and don't know what to do. we're very conflicted and it feels like there is no good answer.**back here again**we've been told to look into city housing or something like that. we've considered it a few times but have never truly attempted it. i'm worried about 2+ year wait lists.we've also briefly considered outright buying a home, but it's not something we want to do until we have stable careers. i've entertained the idea of a tiny house or a van/bus house, but i don't think we want to go down that route for reasons such as internet access and having our own space (we've lived together in a bedroom for over a year now).a few weeks ago, we were stoked to hear from a friend that a place in his building (4 units) will be available by the end of july. however, we found out that the building has a problem tenant that is destructive, so the landlord is waiting on the courts to reopen so he can evict that tenant before anyone else moves in. considering eviction can take a month in itself and there's no eta on courts reopening, we have no idea when this apartment will be open.it's another gut punch. it feels like nothing is working, and meanwhile the situation in the house is as terrible as ever. we're in such a state of confusion and desperation that my boyfriend is looking again for places out-of-state (new places as well as the original city we wanted to move to), even though we can't go for another 2-3 months. staying here another few months is a staggering and incredibly depressing concept, especially with no real end in sight.we want to get full-time jobs so we have more options, but this is nigh impossible until we graduate, and even then i don't know if it's possible in this city. i'll be done next year, but i need to build my career/experience in the meantime in spite of the fact my current job leaves my completely exhausted by the time i get home. my boyfriend won't be done for another three years. to cap it all off, he really wants to change jobs immediately. his main job is awful and he struggles with his second one;

7273,hey 😊 so i’ll keep this really short. i’m a college student and i’m kinda new to the whole adulting thing. and it’s really dreadful. to say the least. but most times when i see stuff about adulting it’s almost always all the really dreadful stuff like taxes and finances and all that. i think it’s more than that. i think becoming a full adult is also about taking accountability and informing ourselves and educating ourselves and others on how not to become screwed up bitter people who can only see the world through their own eyes. anyway. i made an instagram page called @theadultingclass that helps with figuring out the early steps of adulting like moving and saving and cleaning and all that but also that keeps you educated on several issues and spreads positivity and motivation for school and work. it would be great if you guys could check it out. thank you 🤍,3,1,Different take on adulting,Adult

(but none of the friends seemed close - he doesn't keep in contact with them since hs ended. the two girls he was involved with were hot messes and he seemed to act as savior and doormat to them)... he was accepted into a top tier private university on a full ride scholarship based on merit (his major is in the arts). fast forward to his first year of college... he's on the opposite side of the country in a large city. it was a rigorous program and he seemed to be on top of the world at first. i don’t think he made any friends, but he met a girl who had her shit together. i didn’t hear from him much, but i told myself that was totally fine... he left the nest and was living his own life.  but, by the end of the school year he basically was failing most of his classes, the girl broke up with him and he called me one day before finals in the middle of basically a nervous breakdown. my advice was to take his finals, not obsess on what went wrong at that moment, just finish and come home after finals and that i wasn’t going to judge him, but that he had a safe place to come home to and i’d be there for him. it’s been about 8 months. i encouraged him to “take a year off and work on himself”...  he’s working full time now, but not in a job that has any future, he’s also in therapy once a week. but he completely isolates himself. he goes to work but after work and on the weekends he keeps to himself. he was started on some depression medication - actually has been on several, trying to find the right one... when i ask him about next year he just says, “i don’t know”... i feel so bad for him. he seems so depressed and lonely. he barely talks to anyone. he sleeps a lot or watches youtube videos/listens to podcasts. on a side note i helped him get a leave of absence from school so that if he wants to go back it appears that he can, at least on probation. i’ve also told him if he wants to go to a community college next year &amp; live at home he can do that... but again it’s “i don’t know”... as a mom it’s gut wrenching to see him like this. so i need your advice. how can i help him? do i help him?? does he need my help?? yes he’s an adult and needs to be independent and figure his shit out, but is there something i can do? he doesn’t drive. maybe i should encourage him to learn? we live in a huge urban area where getting around seems to necessitate driving... i just wish he had some friends to go do stuff with. do i encourage him to talk about his thoughts about school etc? gah... i just feel helpless seeing him so hopeless. looking back life sure was easier and less complicated when it was about play dates and coloring books and soccer games... i wasn’t prepared for this. i thought he was on the “right track”. i just want him to be happy, whatever he does with his life. tl/dr: single mom of depressed son who flunked out of first year of college who is home now and is totally isolated and depressed and i’m looking for any advice or words of wisdom from the internet peoples... tia",4,1,Advice needed please,Adult

the things i’d lost interest in were starting to become something that i enjoyed again. sure i wasn’t making much money, but i was happy!then, the orders started becoming less and less, the places i went to started becoming sketchier and sketchier, before finally i just gave up on the whole affair (my last delivery was to an old man who flashed his dick at me, so, that was fun. but, alas, a story for another day.) and stopped using the app all together.rinse and repeat until i got my last job as a cashier in a dollar store. now during this time my mother started to plan my future for me (she literally told me that this was what she was doing) and that she wanted me to do a nursing program so that i could eventually become a phlebotomist, (something i actually showed interest in right after i’d dropped out of college. but, we never did.) i liked the idea, and seeing as how it was a short program where i could quickly find a better paying job to pay off loans and figure myself out more. i was ecstatic! we agreed that i should start in august, that we would go halfsies, well august rolls around and it doesn’t happen, my younger sibling goes off to college, we move into a new house, my stepdad’s retired and looking for a job. money’s tight, i understand that. she says that i’ll start next year. i go, okay. so, i stay at my job. and i keep working, thinking that, next year, i’ll do the nursing program, i’ll get a better job, i’ll pay off my student loans, and when i’m comfortable, i’ll go back to college in another year or so. perfect, i love it, this is a plan i can be happy with.then shit happens.the people i was supposed to move in with during my nursing program? they’re now moving far away, so i won’t have a place to stay. okay, i’ll keep staying at home. but, now mom and stepdad wants me to just go back to school, ‘you’re obviously ready, you’ve had enough time, it would just be easier for you and us if you just went back to school.’and at first i, reluctantly agreed. i was getting better, it would have been easier for them.but, fuck me sideways cause life wanted to throw me quite a few curve balls. my job popped me onto closings with 30hrs even though i’m part time. so i stopped seeing my therapist because i never had the time.then i got into my first car accident, totaled my car, got bronchitis- and had to go to work everyday with a sore shoulder and a terrible cough, that stayed for about a month, causing my manager who never got sick to catch it. which made me feel just awful. soon the holidays were upon and customers started to become even bigger dicks. my first ever complaint was filed, then my second a week or so after. both while i had bronchitis. so, i started to spiral again. i stopped wanting to eat, my sleep schedule was and still is atrocious, i started seeing my family maybe once or twice every week or two. the familiar apathy, pain, and doubt reared it’s ugly head. my interests meant nothing to me again, and that familiar fear began to grow inside me as the next year came closer and closer.what if i fail again? i’m just going to fail again. this is hopeless, i’m hopeless. i’m not smart, i’m stupid and everything i do is worthless. i’m worthless. i can’t do this.when i got home every night, i would cry in my car for awhile before going to bed. it was happening again.i put in my two weeks, so that i could have at least 2-3 weeks before school started to myself, to relax.that was a week ago. i’ve just fallen deeper into the wagon, i hate being home or awake. all i want to do is sleep. i’m falling back into old routines, and i’m dreading going back to school, because. i’m not ready. i feel like i haven’t grown, that i don’t know what i want in life, how to be happy, or even how to be a proper adult.i don’t think that i want to go back to college just yet. i want to go back to that nursing program, to become a phlebotomist, work off my debt, move out, live on my own, take a vacation, anything, something. just so that when i’m ready. i can go back to school with a clear mind.i just, how do i tell this to my parents? they seem set on what i should be doing and what they want me to be doing. but, i’m scared. i don’t feel secure with my own mental health anymore. the red warning signs are obvious to me, my depression and anxiety is getting worse again. i’m not financially able to support myself i’m completely reliant on them, there’s no out for me, no plan b. they want me to go back to college, just dive back in full time, no breaks, that’s what they want me to do. that’s my job now. and i don’t want that. i don’t want to go back to college just yet, i want to go to that nursing program we talked about all that time ago, i don’t mind if the rides long, it’s something i can get through and support myself. i want to be an adult.i just don’t want to disappoint them.tl;dr i’m not mentally ready to go back to college, family says i should be, but i’m not. i don’t want to disappoint them, i want to go to a nursing program so that i can be more of an adult. i don’t know how to tell them this.sorry again for the long post, if you guys have any ideas on how to help, it would be much appreciated.cheers!",9,1,"How do I broach the topic of “I don’t think that I want to go back to college right now, please let me go back to that nursing program we talked about instead!”",Adult

7720,"i hope i am posting in the right subreddit, haha. if not, i would be happy to post in a more relevant setting, recommendations always appreciated as always! so yeah, a couple of things have recently started bothering me about elle woods. i first watched the movie when i was like... 13-14? at the time, i didn't understand a lot of the sexual innuendos given that i was living in a very conservative country at the time. then i rewatched it over a decade later at the age of 26 in 2016 when i was studying for some standardized exams, in an effort to gain some inspiration actually - and i did, kind of! i particularly love the colours pink and purple so it was nice to see that it's totally fine to take notes in a bright pen if that's your thing! but let's dig deeper: honestly, we really don't have to dig that deep at all - anyone with half a brain should be able to see that, elle woods is literally swimming in privilege. first of all, she is gorgeous: blonde and blue eyed, not to mention slim. and secondly, consider her socioeconomic status: she clearly is from the upper crust and the only adversity that she ever faces (if it can be considered an adversity at all) is her own choices. i am not saying that she isn't smart... but she had the privilege of hunkering down and studying for her lsat because she didn't have to worry about a job or helping her family make ends meet. her only ""adversity"" was just not partying for a few months - whoop de doo, we should all be so lucky. same when she goes to college. i am surprised no one brings up the fact that the first thing she buys in college is a fucking apple laptop! those are expensive! i work full time as does my partner and there is no way i can just decide on a whim to go buy one! and why doesn't anyone mention that once she is taking classes, she has the luxury of not having to work to support herself and all she needs to do is simply stay in her luxurious dorm room and study - she has a freaking stairmaster in her dorm, for crissakes - and again, those things are expensive! i still can't afford one without hearing the wrath of my husband who will remind me that we still have car payments to make. oh, and getting her hair done while studying. sigh. i recently started thinking about this even more now that kylie jenner is the world's ""first self made billionaire."" while it's undeniable that the young lady has made an extremely big name for herself and no doubt is an excellent marketer knowing how to cater to literally millions of people out there who are clearly interested in her product, she isn't fucking self-made in the slightest. why aren't other people her age raking in billions? because they don't have the family name, nor the big bucks, nor the privilege that will give them even 1/10th of what she has achieved. privilege begets privilege indeed. i honestly don't find elle woods all that inspiring anymore. while i definitely still enjoy the movie whenever i see it and continues to remain one of my favourite movies, i look at it more as something to shut my brain off after a long tiring day, as opposed to viewing it as some kind of life changing epiphany inspirational moment that many people view it as and as i am going to be 30 soon, i have started taking shit a lot more seriously now! i look at people who are going to be 50 soon, who are imperishably unhappy... and who refuse to do anything about it! however, it would be mighty difficult for them now to make any kind of significant change in their lives given that they have family to support, bills to pay, etc. so i am trying to ingrain discipline habits in me now and do things that will reap awards later so that i don't have to look back to my life twenty years down the road and have regrets although i suppose i should say that i do find elle woods' work ethic very inspiring! so i take back what i said in the previous paragraph: i do find elle woods inspiring in the sense that, if you want something, don't let anything or anyone stop you! make a plan, commit to it, and work on it every single day! and don't let anything distract you or get in your way :) and yes, you have to believe in yourself because you are all you have :) what do you guys think?

(all of these wet/dry multi-surface vacs specify *area* rugs, which suggests that they might not be able to handle actual carpet.)as it turns out, on the canned resolve high-traffic carpet cleaner spray foam that my mom uses so much, the instructions actually say you're supposed to rub the foam into the carpet with a rubber brush, let it dry, and then vacuum the area. not the routine my mom does where she lays down the spray, leaves it to soak in, sets up the carpet cleaner machine with cleaning solution and hot water, puts down the second cleaning solution over top, and then has it suck everything up. i've tried googling cleaning carpet without a separate machine several times and have found advice that basically follows the same process as what's on the can of resolve and advice for spot cleaning, and advice aimed at busy households with pets and/or children and such.now, here's my thought- my mom might be insisting that simply vacuuming up dry resolve foam per the instructions doesn't get carpet clean enough because she's had dogs for a long time and my dad has been wearing his work boots inside the house for the last thirty years. when i move, i will be taking my shoes off at the door, i will not have pets (and my parents' dogs aren't allowed to visit per the complex's rules), i will be living entirely alone, and i have no plans to have people over. so my original plan of buying a shark vacuum and vacuuming every other week, and just scrubbing resolve into the carpet with a rubber brush monthly or so might actually be fine. plus, the shark has a vacuum hose so i can get under furniture and in gaps.i just need a solution that will let me do spot cleanings in case of spills, and routine monthly, bimonthly, or quarterly cleanings of my carpet so it, like, smells clean and isn't building up grime over time, like a responsible adult. of course, i would also like to not have to shell out for for two machines and find storage for them in an 865 sq/ft apartment if i don't have to. thoughts?tl;dr: mom insists i need a full carpet cleaner machine for my apartment i think because you do need one for an active household with pets, but i'm not sure my pet-less household of one does.",7,1,Do I actually need a carpet cleaner machine?,Adult

8207,"tldr at the bottomi am 19f, oldest sister, and since my parents divorce (split time 50/50) when i was 7 i had to take on a mature role. i’ve always felt the need to take care of my little sister because my paternal grandparents didn’t trust my mom’s family, and these same grandparents and dad fed me lies about how terrible my mom was. moreover i always felt the need to be the balance and mediator between my parents. it really affected me, but as i got older i learned to think for myself. i mention this because this is probably the hardest part of my childhood and caused me to grow up really quickly.this maturity gave me independence as an adult—ive had a pretty smooth transition to college so far. i know how to budget, study, and manage my dorm room. what i don’t know how to do is deal with the emotional stress that comes with knowing how hard and stressful relationships with family can be, and the pain caused when you feel like you can’t help your family. specifically, my mom feels somewhat unhappy in her marriage and sometimes talks to me about it, cries, etc. i joke that i am the “emotional support daughter,” but it absolutely breaks my heart that i can’t help her. although she always knows the right things to say when i come to her crying, i feel so helpless and that i can’t say the right things to her or help her. she gets so stressed with her business and her relationship, and i try to help around the house as much as i can by cleaning and maintaining while i’m home from school. she is really thankful for it, but i still get anxious and sad that she feels unsupported by her husband.moreover, my 14 y/o sister has recently confided in me that she feels non-binary (she is okay with being referred to as sister/she). it’s not a surprise as she liked to dress more androgynous  , but i get so anxious about how my parents will take it and having to deal with the backlash and ranting to me about it. i love and support her but i know my parents won’t. the biggest thing right now is covid. i’m currently at home and my parents are not super careful. my dad invited my sister and i to a knoxville trip with his fiancée, but i really don’t want to go to a hot spot right now. but now he seems really depressed taht we won’t go, as he’s dreamed of us having a snowy new years (we’re from florida.) i know i’m doing the right thing by staying home with my mom but i feel so guilty, and in general unsafe when my parents make decisions like these.my general question is how to deal with all sorts of emotions in such a stressful time, especially those gained as an adult. obviously as a kid and even teen you don’t always realize or feel responsible for such things, but now that i’m older i feel so much more emotional weight. i’m also just anxiety ridden about the world in general—getting job experience, paying for grad school, starting a life, money, car accidents, everything. please, any advice on any part of this post would be helpful. i just need to learn how to deal with such emotional weight, even when i know there people who have it much worse than me.tldr: as i became an adult, i became more aware of family issues and things in life in general that i can’t seem to fix, and it makes me feel anxious and helpless that i can’t seem to help my family or make them happy. i’m also becoming more aware that life in general is stressful. how do i cope and deal with these emotions in a healthy way?",3,1,"How do you deal with the emotional burdens of being an adult, especially those related to family?",Adult

8304,"new to reddit this is my first post. i’m 23f and i live with my partner (24f), my best friend from college (22f) and another guy that’s quite new to the house but fits in really well. we’re all quite close and love hanging out with each other, like yesterday we had planned to have a barbecue because it was sunny out, but nobody started preparing anything until i did, and by the time they started helping the sun was almost gone so we had the barbecue in the front garden. it was really nice and i started cleaning after and my partner and bff were like no no we will clean that which was nice! but it never happened, as usual, we all continued to hang until going to bed. my bff she’s always been quite a bad housemate, she admits it herself that she doesn’t care as much about cleaning up straight away or for days (you should see her room) but she’s really cool with us asking her to do things, but it’s kind of getting old now and i see my partner kinda jumping on that bandwagon of pfft we’re having fun and just ignoring the filth around them. i find it really frustrating because i always look like a nag or a buzz kill - all i want is for everyone to care as much as i do, but that makes me think i care too much?? i have a very; if it can be done now do it now attitude, like if we all have dinner together and then wanna watch a movie and smoke a few joints wouldn’t it be better if we all just quickly clean up now and then do whatever we want? but this doesn’t happen, i’m the buzz kill for wanting to clean but also the one who will end up doing it all the next day - like my bff and sometimes my partner would rather just ignore it all, and continue using the rest of the clean dishes and adding them to the pile.  we made a cleaning list a while ago, each week we deep clean a different area of the house, but even with this no one does their job until i do, like if i don’t care they don’t care. the new housemate has been my saving grace, he just cleans as he goes along and after he uses something - i’m not super anal i can be a slob too, i understand not wanting do dishes straight after cooking but leaving them for days i don’t understand - but him being here just highlights more how much i have to nag or baby the other two. my standards are that as an adult who is house sharing you have a responsibility to clean up after yourself not have someone do it for you, if we all do little bits as we go along it doesn’t become this big time consuming job that one person (90% of the time me but now sometimes the new housemate) decides they can’t take it anymore and does it.do i just have to deal with other people having different standards? do i continue to nag? i’m sick of it i feel like my mam. but at the same time, they seem happy enough so maybe i’m the problem. any advice would be very appreciated!",31,1,Does anyone else feel like they have to nag/parent other adult into doing everyday things they should be doing themselves?,Adult

8308,"tl;dr:  hired for my first job out of college with a relatively new company that works closely with its parent company. i’m doing work for the parent company that i wasn’t hired to do and not getting bonused for that work like the other employees because i technically only work for the child company, not the parent company that i’m doing my work for. without getting into a ton of detail, i was hired out of college to do a job for this company that’s only a few years old and is getting ready to really get some things going. they work with the support of their parent company, and every employee of the new company works for the parent company (until i got hired, i only work for the new one). i was excited for this opportunity because i like the company and i felt like i brought a lot to the table despite being brand new to the work world. now a month in, i’ve found myself working for the parent company about 80% of the time despite that not being what i was hired to do. in addition, i don’t get paid like i work at the parent company. each month, the employees of said company get a bonus based on company performance but because i’m technically only supposed to be working for the new company, i don’t get a bonus at all. i’m frustrated and feel like i shouldn’t or can’t voice my concerns. thankfully, i’ll eventually switch over to what i’m supposed to be doing at the end of the summer (hopefully). i know the company is in transition and this is a weird time to be starting a new job so some flexibility is required. i’m cool with that. but there has been no communication about what to expect and i’ve just had more and more work for the parent company sucking the joy out of working for the new one. so to finally get to the point... lol... what do i do here? can i/should i say something? i don’t want to sound entitled or ungrateful, especially being 22 and new to the job. however, there’s been no expectations set and it’s really frustrating. also the whole bonus thing seems super unfair. idk. i’m just frustrated and dreading clocking in tomorrow. any advice would be awesome.",8,1,First full-time job isn’t going the way I thought it would,Adult

8353,"posted on the mental health subreddit, new to this one, don’t know if this post is okay for this subreddithi everyone, i hope you all are okay, i’m a 19 year old girl &amp; this post is going to be a long one i just have a lot on my chest. my therapist is on maternity leave hence why i’m here. i am diagnosed with major depressive disorder recurrent, major anxiety disorder recurrent, and eating disorder not specified for reference. right before i turned 18 i tried multiple antidepressants and antianxiety medications (none of them worked for me) and i’ve been off them for more than a year now, when i turned 18 a switch went off inside of me it sounds silly but everything used to be so beautiful to me everything was so deep and meaningful; morning dew on the grass, the way the sunsets, driving, rainfall, conversations, emotions, everything held this grand meaning to me, until the day i turned 18, ever since then i’ve been living through this fog, i don’t feel much, i don’t feel these intense connections, i am just here, going though the motions. through 14-17 i was partying a lot, had a really bad eating disorder which i recovered from but recently relapsed. i dropped out of highschool my senior year which is a shame i’ve always been a smart kid in school but my mental state destroyed me, and i’m getting my ged as soon as this covid19 thing is over. i have an opportunity to move 7 hours away driving from my hometown and start a new life in my own apartment and go to college there. i’m really close to my family, really close, (codependent much). i work and have two close friends i see a couple of times a month. i’ve never had a lot of luck with friends or any type of relationship and that’s because i’m not secure in myself i feel like. my day to day includes waking up, talking to my parents for a while, going to work, going home &amp; talking with my parents, scrolling through social media and going to sleep. it’s funny because i always wanted to be this “free” person but i’m so self disciplined and love control that i don’t allow myself to be. my parents were always so cool with me and trusted me but i made these structures and boundaries for myself this need for perfection. in middle school &amp; highschool i was well liked i always put people first and was always there for everyone. i still am, i’m just overall an empathetic person to the point that i forget about me. im also selfish and don’t accept people when i don’t agree with their actions. it’s weird i’m a lot of things. i’m writing this sitting on the couch listening to a bon iver song it’s gloomy out, i haven’t even gotten to the point i’m just rambling. my mom she’s my bestfriend she was diagnosed with copd and emphysema when i was 16 (i was in costa rica at the time on vacation with my ex bestfriend) when i came back she had an oxygen tank and no one had told me, she’s hospitalized atleast 5 times a year because she continues to smoke even when she’s on oxygen. my uncle who i was close with died 2 months ago from a heart attack, he was as alone at his farm, no one had heard from him all day, my aunt drove to the farm and found him, he also had copd he never really took care of it either (still smoked and drank a bottle of jim bean everyday, it was a shock to the whole family, his family came from north carolina, i saw his dead body at the viewing and i held his hand and cried a lot. the week before he died my mom and my aunt really wanted to go to church (which was weird they never go) and i said outloud someone in our family is going to die and i thought it would be my grandpa or grandma but never him (this isnt the first time i’ve had this intense 6th sense, it happens when something that is going to change my life or someone else’s life is about to occur) ever since he died something changed, all i think about is how my mom could be next, i love her so much. i am grieving when she’s still alive. my mom tried to kill herself when i was 14 and was baker acted and attempted again on my 17th birthday and was also baker acted for a month. i’ve almost lost her twice and now i have to go through it again and i don’t know when and it’s killing me, i don’t know what to do with myself it’s all i think about, i picked up my eating disorder again as a security blanket and no one knows and i just want to scream and cry and i want to die before my mom does i can’t bare to see this. it’s so sad seeing someone deteriorate right before your eyes and they don’t want to help themselves it’s selfish but i love her i love my family they are all i have i don’t want to live in a world without my family i don’t have anything or anyone i feel like i’m just a kid. whenever i touch or look or talk to my mom i do it as if it’s my last time. i’m lucky to have a beautiful relationship with my mom, dad, sister, cousins, aunts and uncles, i know some people have it worse. i just don’t feel good i want to disappear. where did the time go?

8784,"i'm a big philosopher as a thinker, to begin with, and i'm guessing you know some introvert that can tell you that it is a double-edged sword (i get it from my parents).  i have deconstructed plenty things before, like putting up with someone, or handling social situations, for example, and there's an initial stage where it gives you more security in dealing with whatever thing gets you distracted or insecure or whatever, but then when you don't have friends to really talk about it to, your mind can get tunnel vision and take it too far, or rely on it too much, and re-wire your brain in a way you never intended.  what i mean by this is something louis ck said in a routine, ""here's how my brain works: its stupidity, followed by self-hatred, and then further analysis.  it's not a very efficient system of thought""but i want to talk about something frustrating to me... sexual fantasies and how they get irreparably ruined very easily.  when i was a 19 yr old living at home like most millennials, i, of course, explored masturbation in my room, not that i started at 19... that'd be late, right??.. nevermind.  what else are you going to do when you are seeing young girls my age everywhere but don't have any means to impress them with.  not to say i was lonely or friendless, and i held a job and also went to the gym, but just saying masturbation was very necessary back then.  there was a girl at my part-time job that generated a lot of fantasies for me in my special time, and this was pre-internet porn for me (not to say i'm middle-aged, or morman or anything.  we still had mid-2000s dial-up. its a post for another time of all worries of my damages cause i got to the internet later than my peers).  but eventually, after working alone with her for 2-3 shifts a week, we became friends, and while i still think she was one of the most attractive people i've met in real life..she was a cameron diaz looking girl who had brothers and liked to joke around.. i guess the friendship made me stop thinking about her in ""that way"" when alone.  but you really never stop being attracted to girls with a personality you like too... but i had a few sports illustrated swimsuit issues and would steal my neighbor's victoria's secret brochures with all those models- and of course some dvd of comedies with some gratuitous young hot girl who is only in the movie for the nude scene (caddyshack, american pie, etc).  it was an innocent time.. anyway, i'll continue.  it was at 19 when i was in my 3rd semester of community college, was not sure of my major anymore with growing pressure from my parents.  i was having a more balanced social life than i had ever had in high school, likely from observational learning from that friend at work; she was introverted too.  in retrospect, my connection with masturbation changed.  it was less about feeding my ego, and more just my routine to take a break from my stress.   and that's the confidence i was talking about that is, the pride before the fall.   don't worry ladies, you're perspective on that will be addressed. if any girls are still reading this,  i know that for decades or centuries married women have given men routine sex as a reward for good habits, or security, or to 'keep the marriage healthy"" but most don't climax every time.  but also reminding you that this is coming from a male's perspective and i may put two words like 'radical' and 'feminists' together later. actually, if you think i was a 19 yr old who would put american pie, old school, or caddyshack on pause makes me as complicit as the weinstein company, just slooow your roll for one second. that being said, of course, like everyone i have embarrassments from my youth.  maybe i jumped too far, and you wouldn't of thought of it until now but it kinda goes to show the kind of fear i live in today. but this community is about non-judgment, right?  i'm posting all this anonymously on the internet because everything here is just something i can't talk about to anyone irl.what was this about?? the dangers of re-wiring my brain so that i'm not myself anymore.. yea.i started wondering what was it about all those models in bathing suits that made me sweat without even thinking as a 19 yr old.  and since, i've matured and learned that an orgasm is basically the same brain reaction for a man or woman, and, for straight women, the path to get there is completely different. i still cannot fathom if it's not visual for you... you can't possibly be thinking of a guy's sense of humor while you masturbate if our orgasms are the same.  so it must be his smile, his height, his haircut, or a physical act you've seen or can imagine him doing.  all of those are strong indications he's a healthy person so masturbatory thoughts about it are pretty healthy.  all that plays almost no part in a male thought.  well, at least speaking for sex fantasies... but height and muscles are best-case non-motivating, worst case turn-offs.  and anyway, in conclusion, i want to say that the advancement of the last 10-15 yrs where girls are saying they want to wear make-up for their own reasons, and that if she wants to wear yoga pants she can and guys are supposed to be more evolved than to leer or gaze is all really confusing.  hormones are real.  i can understand a little concealer but why are you wearing so much!?

(1) sleep deprivation. you will feel the ill-effects of sleep deprivation long before you are falling asleep in class/the library or finding it impossible to get up for your early classes. you will lose focus, become more irritable, and more susceptible to depression and anxiety. spoil yourself with sleep above all other things, even studying sometimes, because it's an investment in the rest of your semester not falling apart.(2) having good nutrition doesn't just mean survive on food other than sugared cereal and ramen. if you can cook for yourself, foods like eggs (scrabled, boiled, whatever) and lentil soup are easy to make and super cheap. try to eat a few servings of fruits and vegetables every day - even if it's a disappointing apple from the cafeteria. carrots are also cheap, peel them and just eat them as a snack, you can dip them in peanut butter or hummus (cheap and easy to make with garlic, canned chickpeas, tahini, and a bit of lemon).(3) lack of privacy is the hardest one to pin down. but with dorm or group house living, it can be hard to keep other people out of your room either physically or just with the disruption of their voices. find quiet places and times to work and train yourself to work well there. plenty of students say, truthfully, that they can't study in the library because it's too quiet. it's just a new habit to get into. even studying in a coffee shop is a better option, because it's more like white noise from people you don't know.",17,8,"LPT: The 3 hidden thieves of productivity in college are sleep-deprivation, poor nutrition, and lack of privacy.

2749,"**some background:**i just re-refinanced my student loans (more on that shortly). i first refinanced about 80,000 in graduate student loans a little over a year ago. when i did so, i dropped my interest rate almost a full 2.5 percent (from a 6.8% variable interest rate down to a 4.09% fixed rate), while also cutting the payment schedule of my loan from about 25 years to 10 years. this refinance also consolidated the “shell game” of paying off multiple student loans (some subsidized, some unsubsidized, some pell grants, etc.) across four or five different loan service providers, each of whom seemed to change every 6-12 months. in short, this refinance took what was a stressful and confusing and frustrating amount of bookkeeping and organized my loans in a single, much more affordable, and manageable debt.i know that refinancing isn't always the best move for everyone because federal loans have certain protections in place (grace periods, deferment, income-based repayment, etc.), but my financial situation and credit score improved (800+ credit score now!) so much since the time i was in college about 10 years ago that this seemed like a wise move. given the tens of thousands of dollars this saved me over the total course of my loan, i feel like this was one of the best financial decisions i ever made. obviously, research your loans and your loan providers before deciding. i'm not a certified financial advisor or anything like that.**life pro tip 1:** **if you want to refinance, rates are lower than ever now! shop around!**honestly, i didn't think i could find a better rate than what i had last year, but, given that interest rates are so ridiculously low right now, i figured that i'd shop around and see if i might save some money. i ran price comparisons with 10 different loan companies. each quote takes about 5 minutes and requires a ""soft check"" on your credit, so it doesn't impact your credit score until you start the actual application. i found a handful of rate quotes around 3.35% for a 7 year fixed rate refinance, and even found one as low as 3.31%! i was able to cut a 9-ish year debt at 4.09% down to a 7 year debt at 3.31% while only increasing my monthly payments by about $100. given that i was already paying an extra $100 or so over my required payment amount each month, my day-to-day expenses didn’t change but i shaved two years off my debt!that's a huge reduction on what i thought was an already low rate! over the course of my loan, that saves me about $5000 (even more if i pay down the principal early).**life pro tip 2: if you like your current loan provider, ask for a rate match**i'll start with a bit of a plug here: after years of terrible student loan providers shuffling my debt around different servicers ever year or so, i was thrilled with the quality and easy-to-use customer service by my new loan provider: sofi. i was disappointed that they didn't offer the lowest rate this time around, and i really didn't like the idea of changing to a different company that might not offer as good of service.i decided to call sofi and ask if they'd consider a rate match. i was able to speak with a loan representative in less than five minutes and negotiate a match. they offered me a 3.29% fixed interest rate, which was .02% lower than my lowest offer.all i had to do is start a new refinance application, call the customer service representative again about the rate match, and then upload a screenshot of the offer from the other company. it took a few phone calls back and forth for me to upload the correct documents, but i never had to wait for more than a minute to reach a customer service representative.**bonus life pro tip 3: before refinancing with a loan provider, try calling their customer service line to test their wait times.**i learned the hard way early on in my student loan journey that some student loan providers are a pain in the ass. i had a series of nightmares, from a loan company accidentally sending me too much money once (then demanding i send it back as a lump sum) to another company accidentally putting my loan into repayment while i was enrolled as a full-time student (this impacted my credit and i had to have my state’s attorney general’s office intervene to get all of this sorted out; it was a mess), or another loan company initially denying me a grace period when i finished college (probably because the other company put my loan into repayment when they were not supposed to), or giving me incorrect start dates for my payments-- due to confusions about the grace period laws-- then demand payment earlier than initially quoted. companies caused a few other messes, but those were the most notable. i couldn't afford a lawyer, and i'm not sure if one would have been helpful, but i ran into a huge amount of headaches caused by evil and/or incompetent loan companies looking for ways to hit me with late fees. if i were not a fastidious notetaker (thanks, grad school!), i would have been in serious trouble.probably the most frequent frustration of all was that my loans kept changing service providers with minimal notice. because i never had a clear sense of who owned my loans or whom i should call whenever i ran into problems like those above, all of this felt like a shell game. whenever i tried calling a company to ask for help, i typically had to wait 20-30 minutes on hold before speaking to a customer service representative, only to find that they had shuffled my loan off to a different company.when i was started shopping for student loan refinance companies last year, i looked at rate comparisons first, then i tried calling the customer service lines for the top two or three offers. i intentionally tried to call lines there were intended to offer support for existing loans, and not support lines catered to sales/refinancing, because i know some companies might prioritize sales and neglect existing customer support (an inverse trick i learned during the ""shell games"" i talked about earlier: if you call a company's sales line, you might reach a support person faster. sometimes, this won't save you time, since they'll transfer you to a general hold line, but sometimes a kind sales person will transfer you directly). when comparing these similar offers, i used my experiences with their customer service representatives to help me decide.i’ll add a shameless plug here: i ended up going with sofi because i never once have had to wait more than a minute on hold when trying to speak with a customer service representative. i’m relieved that they offered a rate match on my second refinance, because i’m not sure if i’d have received as good of customer service elsewhere. there are some excellent companies out there—sofi has been great for me, and i’m sure others have some great success stories, too. watch out for the bad companies though!shameless plug: i’m not paid by sofi or anything, just a happy customer. that said, if you decide to refinance with sofi, use my loan referral code and we both get $200: [sofi.com/share/1208768?src=copy](https://sofi.com/share/1208768?src=copy)&amp;#x200b;",8,3,LPT: Now Is A Great Time To Refinance Student Loans; Here Are Some Lessons I Learned,Adult

3986,"hi, sorry if this is a bit long. i would describe this as my experiences that i had in 2020. i hope you can take something out of my life.**wow**i honestly have no other words. what happened? i’m baffled. this year was something else. this year was the most life changing of my life. hands down. it had its lows, it had its highs, but ultimately, everything changed. and it all started with a girl. here is my journey.my second semester of my senior year of high school. the first year i have ever started with a girlfriend. i was happy and content. i would describe 2019 as the happiest year of my life because of this girl. she was my first girlfriend and my first love. i loved her with all my heart. 2019 was just so amazing because of her. before her my life felt so dull and stagnant. she was the light in my darkness. i never could’ve guessed that i would learn one of the most important lessons of life at this point. and not just about life, but about reality. how everything can slip away in an instant without you noticing.she was so bright that it blinded me. it blinded me from everything falling apart in my life. my debt to my parents, my recent car accident, my school struggles, and ultimately my self improvement. she made me feel like i was enough as is, so why should i change? if i was enough for this girl who i loved with my whole heart, then why should i try to be better? i thought she had helped me move my stagnant life, but that was not the case. she was merely the best distraction from my miserable life. the eight months of our relationship were the best distraction from reality anybody could ask for. no money nor lust could overcome my love for her. i thought that by not changing i was helping us, but i was wrong. this is where reality shattered the fragile picture that i had painted in my head. of the boy and girl who were so in love that they could stay framed on that wall forever.in a single moment, my first love became someone who i used to know. that last month was truly painful. as the sand like foundations of our relationship began to fall through my hands, and she walked away. i was left clueless. i had my first mental breakdown walking to take my math final. i was unable to express any emotions. i couldn’t miss this important test, so my mind shutdown. that hour and a half felt like a second. as i put my head down on the desk after i had finished, i felt nothing. i just laid there. helpless. she texted me on that walk, that we couldn’t meet to talk because she wasn’t coming today after saying the night before we would talk. what else was i supposed today. when we separated, she ultimately never told me why. i had to figure it out myself. that was the hardest part.we broke up in january of 2020. it was my first heart brake of my first relationship with my first love. it took me months to get over it and i ultimately made a lot of embarrassing decisions during this time. i did a lot of things i regret. i acted out of pure emotion because i had no idea how to deal with this new crazy emotion. that first month and a half where i would do anything in my power to avoid seeing her was hard, but once the quarantine started was where the true challenge would begin. unable to go out or do anything to distract myself from this devastating feeling, i was forced to confront it straight ahead. the hours and hours that i was kept just thinking, “why?” were the most painful. i lost myself to addictions such as anime, manga, games, tinder, etc. after experiencing something so amazing how could i ever return to living stagnant.i tried to find girls that would give me that attention that i wanted. that light the left a dark whole in my heart. i never did find anyone to fill that hole. the hole was there before i had even begun dating her. she had just been so bright that i didn’t even see the hole. those long long days of quarantine made me realize this.it wasn’t all that bad though. my friends helped me through this. i focused on making money and bettering myself as much as i could. thanks to my friend i was given a huge opportunity when it came to the financial section of my life and no longer had to worry about debt to my parents. school became easy as it was all online and i passed all my classes and graduated. i started to work on some hobbies like working out and reading that made me feel like i was improving my lifestyle. it seemed like everything was looking up, but i just couldn’t seem to fill that hole in my heart no matter what i tried to fill it with. i had no idea why the hole was there or what i could do to do something about it. whenever i would think about the hole, i would think about her.there were several time i reached out to her after we had broken up. every-time i did, it hurt. it made me feel like i would hurl whenever i would even think of her, but for some reason i tried to ignore that feeling over and over. talking to her was even worse than just thinking of her. i would unconsciously wait for her reply constantly causing massive stress. i did so many embarrassing things to try to sate this feeling such as thank her for everything, re-confess my feelings for her and ask to go out again, and accuse her of cheating and write a horrible letter. i regret all of those things, because i didn’t mean any of them. later on i would try to be friends with her and text her again months after all those previous things, but then i realized that the feeling of hurling didn’t go away. that was when i realized that we couldn’t be friends. or lovers, or acquaintances or people who interact with each other. she would always be first and foremost above all else my ex. it took me a long time to realize that an ex was someone just like a friend or an enemy. it didn’t matter who’s fault it was that the relationship fell apart or what we had happened in the past. if it could’ve ended better than this, then why didn’t it. if it should have then it should have ended that way. but it didn’t. we were young.she was at the center of my change during 2020. she changed my life and she will always have a place in my heart as my first love. i don’t think you will ever read this, but if you ever do end up reading this and recognizing this story, thank you. i have become a better man because of you and turned my life around. thank you so much.well other then this major change, i ended up moving away from my hometown to attend college and had my first experience with the adult world. i got to meet new people in a city that i had never lived in before. quarantine made it hard, but i met some people that ended up being pretty cool. i had my first experience with alcohol and weed and learned why people can become addicted to it. i’m not saying i’m addicted or ever did get addicted, just that they’re enjoyable. i mainly just wanted to learn my limitations for both so that i could be safe in the future.this year was the hardest of my life. i had to undergo so many new emotions and experiences that i couldn’t have ever imagined were that intense. along with all my personal experiences the world was undergoing major troubles with various events that will probably make this year go down in history. as of right now, i would describe 2020 as the most life changing year of my life. i will never forget or act like this year never existed because it did. those feelings were real and just prove that i’m just as much human as anyone else. it might not be as bad as some others, but to me it was huge. to those who are reading this

803,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/joe-biden-labor-workers-rights-unions-wagesoon after joe biden is inaugurated as the next us president, he is expected to take several strong steps on the labor front aimed at reversing or remedying the policies of donald trump – who promised workers a lot and delivered little.but biden’s number one priority will be to tackle the issues left in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.healthcare to the electoral college: seven ways 2020 left america exposedrobert reichrobert reichread morebiden’s nominee for secretary of labor, marty walsh – the mayor of boston and before that a labor leader for decades – is likely to help advance biden’s promises to help unions expand. walsh, who had headed boston’s federation of building trades unions, is expected to support increased spending on infrastructure to upgrade roads and bridges, strengthen the economy and create good-paying jobs. as mayor, he pushed for construction contractors to hire more workers of color.with covid-19 still raging across the us, many job safety experts say it’s urgent for biden to do something that the trump administration has failed to do: issue nationwide regulations directing businesses to take specific steps to protect their workers from the coronavirus, whether retail, restaurant, factory or construction workers.trump’s business-friendly occupational safety and health administration (osha) repeatedly rejected labor unions’ pleas to adopt such safety standards.“clearly priority one is an emergency standard for osha dealing with covid and equally a focused, full-on press on inspections, enforcement and guidance. it means doing everything osha hasn’t been doing,” said david weil, a top labor department official under barack obama. “ultimately the only way we’ll get public safety and reopening is if we get worker safety.”weil, now the dean at brandeis university’s heller school for social policy, said osha under biden should get far tougher than trump’s osha in holding employers accountable for failing to take steps to minimize covid. many worker advocates were dismayed by the modest fines that trump’s osha assessed, for instance, a $13,494 penalty against smithfield’s pork-processing plant in sioux falls, south dakota, where at least 1,294 workers contracted covid. smithfield’s parent company had revenues of $24.1bn last year.biden has signaled he will take many other pro-worker actions.although trump held himself out as a champion of workers, he did nothing to raise the minimum wage or enact paid leave, while biden has repeatedly called for a $15 minimum wage and guaranteeing workers 12 weeks’ paid family and medical leave. biden has also backed far-reaching legislation that would make it easier to unionize, and his appointees to the national labor relations board (nlrb) are likely to reverse many trump labor board decisions that made it harder for workers to join unions.steven pitts, a longtime labor economist at the university of california, berkeley, said biden should pursue two sets of labor policies. “one is try to raise and protect labor standards like a higher minimum wage and tougher safety rules,” he said. “second is to build worker power into policy. too often we focus on the former and not the latter.”biden has indicated he will seek to build worker power by strengthening unions. on election day eve, campaigning in western pennsylvania, he promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen”. in his campaign platform, biden endorsed the protecting the right to organize act (pro act) which would make it easier for unions to organize workers by, among other things, greatly increasing penalties on corporations that break the law in battling to keep out unions.solid republican opposition, along with a filibuster, blocked efforts by barack obama and bill clinton to enact pro-union legislation, and it will be similarly difficult for biden to enact the pro act unless he musters 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.because senate republicans so often vote in line with corporate america’s wishes, it might also be difficult for biden to get a $15 minimum wage or paid family and medical leave through the senate.william samuel, director of government affairs at afl-cio, the largest federation of unions in the us, acknowledges that passing the pro act – a huge goal of labor – won’t be easy. he recommends that biden, in addition to pushing to pass the pro act, pursue a parallel strategy: “he should use his bully pulpit to support the right of workers to organize and to shame employers who trample on those rights” – for example, by criticizing amazon for firing the worker who led a new york walkout over covid-19 safety.“there will be lots of obstacles in his [biden’s] way and we can hope and pray he can use his executive authority and the bully pulpit to advance the cause of workers,” samuel said.because the senate might be a formidable barrier to pro-union or pro-worker legislation, samuel says biden should use federal procurement policy to raise standards for workers. many worker advocates want biden to require federal contractors to pay their workers a minimum of $15 an hour and guarantee them two-weeks’ paid medical and family leave.biden and his running mate, kamala harris, opposed a california ballot initiative in which voters – swayed in part by a $200m campaign financed by uber and other app-based companies – approved a measure that categorizes uber and lyft drivers and doordash delivery workers as independent contractors rather than employees. by defining them as independent contractors, the ballot initiative, known as proposition 22, means these workers won’t receive state minimum wage or overtime protections, won’t receive paid sick days or unemployment compensation and won’t have their companies reimburse their expenses, like gasoline.uber has said it hopes to pass prop 22-like laws or ballot initiatives to other states. but pitts said: “how do we find a way to stop the spread of prop 22 around the country – that’s an important thing.”it’s going to be a slog to undo all the damage that’s been done the past four years by the trump majority on the boardwilma liebmanworker advocates hope biden’s labor department will issue guidance that goes far to trump prop 22 by saying that under federal minimum wage and overtime laws, uber and lyft drivers should be considered employees, not independent contractors, because they are not truly independent: uber and lyft have great control over the work the drivers do, and the drivers are not really independently in business for themselves.weil, who headed the labor department’s wage and hour administration, said prop 22’s definition of independent contractors contradicts the definition under the federal fair labor standards act, a 1938 law that creates nationwide minimum wage and overtime protections. “you just can’t decide, ‘i can treat them as independent contractors if that’s counter to what our fair labor standards act says,’” weil said.the trump administration recently awarded an $810m contract to uber and lyft to provide rides to public agencies. worker advocates say the general services administration should use its power to set contract conditions to insist that uber and lyft pay their drivers $15 an hour and treat them as employees.labor leaders say they hope biden’s nlrb will reverse many of the anti-union actions taken by trump’s nlrb – for instance, making it harder for workers at franchises like mcdonald’s to unionize, making it harder for small groups of workers at larger establishments to unionize, letting employers prohibit workers from using the company email system to discuss union matters, letting companies bar union organizers from spaces open to the public, like corporate cafeterias.“it’s going to be a slog to undo all the damage that’s been done the past four years by the trump majority on the board,” said wilma liebman, who was nlrb chair during obama’s first term. “their overruling of precedent has been so sweeping. they’ve overruled precedents that went back decades.”liebman said the trump board’s reversals of precedent twisted a pro-worker law, the national labor relations act, in ways that always favored employers. but republicans say the trump board was merely undoing what they saw as the unduly pro-union tilt of the obama board.",6,1,"[The Guardian] Biden’s nominee for Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh is likely to issue guidance at the federal level to trump Prop 22 by saying

[https://geniussports.com/home/partners/](https://geniussports.com/home/partners/)&amp;#x200b;genius is above other spacs due to its mature market position and strong financials. the company has been growing at a 30% cagr over the last several years, with revenue growing 250% from 2016 to 2020 ($42m to $145m). 60% of revenue is recurring due to multi year contracts, and the top 10 customers only account for 30% of revenue, thus lowering flight risk of any particular customer. genius is already ebitda positive with 10% margins this year, and anticipates $68m in adjusted ebitda (adjusted to ignore stock based compensation, a non-cash expense) with 29% margins in two years. &amp;#x200b;in a year where sports were disrupted by covid, genius still grew revenue from $116m to $145m. they also successfully resigned their contract with the nba, ensuring a multi-year partnership with the premiere us basketball league. outside of the betting market, genius’s ability to aggregate data has led to an interesting agreement with the ncaa. until 2018, live data with college sports was incredibly inefficient. genius signed a contract with the ncaa to create a new software: ncaa livestats [https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/](https://geniussports.com/sports/sports-management/ncaa-case-study/). this is a uniform software for all divisions of college sports. as a former college athlete myself, i reached out to some of the athletic support staff from my university. they raved about how genius has improved efficiency and accuracy for college athletics. ncaa livestats has overhauled the entire industry.&amp;#x200b;i also think the ncaa presents the biggest upside catalyst for genius: march madness. march madness was cancelled due to the pandemic last year, but betters placed $4.8b in bets on the tournament in 2019. who has a monopoly on ncaa data? genius. who gets a 5% revenue share from all sports books for ncaa events? genius. with the number of states with legalized betting doubling from 2018 to 2020, we could see upwards of $10b spent on march madness this year.&amp;#x200b;along with march madness, secular tailwinds for sports betting suggest high upside for genius moving forward. 46 out of 50 states have either passed or presented legislation to legalize sports betting. as states such as ny, ca, tx, and fl legalize betting, revenues streams will swell. data will become increasingly important in this industry as live updates are constantly moving betting lines for books. with multi-year contracts with half of the us’s professional leagues, genius serves as an index for the entire industry.&amp;#x200b;additionally, with pfizer’s vaccine approval, there is little to no risk of massive sports cancellations in the future. genius still grew revenue during covid’s massive disruption. i imagine that the revenue numbers for 2021 will be fantastic.&amp;#x200b;now let’s focus on the stock movement and valuation. genius is valued as $1.4b, or 7.4x 2021 revenues. for a company with high cagr and an industry with massive tailwinds, this seems like a fair, or cheap valuation. note that genius is trading at a steep discount to lower margin businesses such as sportsbooks golden nugget, draftkings, and penn. while investors have been chasing the next hot ev ipo, genius has slowly climbed from $10 to $13. last summer, a rumored feac-sportradar merger led to feac pumping to $15+. sportradar was worth $2.8b in 2018, presenting 60% upside from genius’ current price to reach its competitor’s 2018 valuation! dmyd and genius announced their merger in late october during a market downturn, thus letting it go overlooked. i think this is a sleeper spac that will have a massive influx of news in q1, as its merger aligns with the climax of college basketball and the beginning of march madness. a single benzinga article pumped the stock by almost 20% last week. imagine the upside when the broader market realizes they can invest in the data behind the sports betting industry. &amp;#x200b;personally, i am long $166k in dmyd stock, and have no intention of selling anytime soon. always do your own dd, but i hope this post helps.",6,1,DMYD &amp; Genius Sports: Index for Sports Betting with Strong Tail Winds,Finance

1971,"**personal bias**:* i was swing trading $tsla since early this year with small-sized profits, but always exited positions because i believed it was overvalued. * finally decided to invest in a long position a few weeks before the split after really doing some dd and research on the company. * i'm in my late 20s, and anticipate investing in $tsla for the next 20+ years. * i own 13 shares with an average share price of $428. i have been dca'ing periodically on top of buying bits anytime it dips 6% or more.* i know these are rookie ass numbers and some of y'all have been invested way longer. i just wanted to share my thoughts on $tsla long term! ______________________**why i am extremely bullish**:1. i studied engineering in college like musk (actually he was in physics, but in a related, relevant field) and the concept of ethics + morality is emphasized &amp; deemed imperative throughout engineering + physics classes / seminars / programs. i kinda obsessed over musk this past year to try and understand his persona and character and thought-process and watched any interview i could find online, read his articles, watched live events, read reviews from past/current employees. it was pretty evident that this guy is interested in bettering the world (reducing emissions, decreasing dependence on foreign oil &amp; drilling, self-sustainability in homes, and more). from what i gathered, he genuinely believes in tesla's mission statement and most importantly, is confident in delivering. perhaps this is too anecdotal and emotional to have any real bearing, but i am bullish on companies motivated by the bigger picture (in this case energy).2. he has largely been focused on growth over profit, and this is the only correct approach imo to running a company that is tasked with introducing ground-breaking, societal-changing, futuristic technology to the world. ***here are some of tesla's major costs***:training a neural network to read the road like a human takes an extraordinary amount of resources. you want the ai to have seen every damn inch of the earth so it has exposure to different variabilities while driving and makes the safe, correct maneuver.  another is investing in producing in-house batteries. another is upgrading its facilities to better streamline production and increase efficiency. another is expanding its facilities themselves across the world like germany for example and then domestically like the giga in texas. another is solar technology. none of this stuff is profitable right now. no one is paying tesla for its efforts in optimizing the ai or for any of its other endeavors i just mentioned. they have a 35k car (model 3) to get an ev out there many can afford and thus build a reputation in the public of a working model..... its not to earn profits. tesla is focusing on solidifying its foundations now so that it can be profitable in the (increasingly near) future. 3. let's talk about the super high p/e value for $tsla stock. stock price keeps rising, but earnings stay low. this is the primary metric used by the $tsla bears suggesting the stock is overvalued and in a bubble that's about to burst. but if you agree with the points i made in #2 above, you can understand why the profits are low. $amzn had a period with a p/e of 1000+. in the ensuing years, though, its p/e came back down to more normal levels, but the stock price kept rising. why? because their earnings started to increase. and this is why it takes a believer and due diligence to invest in this stock. do you understand why tesla is focusing on growth over profits right now? do you believe that it can overcome challenges to produce a dope product (and service)? if you say no - then you are fine to think the p/e ratio is too damn high and you should not invest long term. but if you do your research, agree with their approach, and believe that tesla is going to become a highly profitable company, then who fucking cares about the p/e ratio! earnings will come and the p/e value will become averaged and normal while price will also increase. 4. there's the mandate to cease ice vehicle production by 2030-2035. it's a (largely) global mandate and so when that time comes, you're going to have to buy an ev. which guy do you think will have the most refined product? gm, porshe, volkswagen? or tesla, that has ***solely*** focused on ev for its lifespan? do you believe other companies can just magically catch-up and be on par with tesla experience-wise? keep in mind that many auto companies are being forced into ev. watch some (not so) old videos of gm mechanics &amp; engineers who proudly tout their gas-operated ices and mock evs like its some ridiculous technology. can you really believe that despite all these disadvantages, these same guys can produce a product superior to tesla? do you feel comfortable trusting a product with significantly lesser testing time than one who has been at it for years longer?5. autonomous driving. i keep reading that all the auto dealers can easily ""catch-up to the new ev technology"" to be on par with tesla's ev (which btw doesn't really make sense to me). but for fun let's say that somehow it happened. autonomous fsd needs to be tested thoroughly to be deemed safe for public use. won't that take years of trial and error and testing and more beta testing and changes and recalls and delays? like many of you, i've watched the fsd beta videos for tesla street driving ai. it is nothing short of incredible. yes of-course there are problems, though, and they are being worked on. this is all a normal r&amp;d procedure for fsd that any car dealer must complete before releasing to the public. how in the world can they catch-up so quickly then?6. as we have heard from the bulls (*maybe* *too many* *times...*), tesla isn't just a car company. its mission is to reduce emissions, increase self-sustainability (with solar panels for homes, cars), and revolutionize the electric grid with distributing solar power. also they sell these really comfy ass shorts. does gm sell comfy shorts? i'll wait.______________________**things that make me doubt tesla:**1. (this one is simply conjecture, not fact-based). a reduction in enthusiasm / effort towards tesla from elon musk due to having to manage all of his other endeavors. if spacex, starlink go public causing his workload to multiply, can we still expect tesla leadership to run the company with the same drive and motivation?2. i keep reading stories and reviews of tesla cars that need to go in for repairs shorty after being purchased. seat issues, door issues, tires falling out. my neighbor bought a model y and said he had to take it back the first week because there was problems with the seat not moving or something. he did say that after the repair, the car has been perfect and he'll never go back to an ice. still, pretty concerning that so much random shit seems to happen right outta the box. 3. even if they become the sole clear-cut leader in ev auto vehicles (2030), can we justify a market cap that compares to $amzn or $goog or $msft or $aapl? what if they also became the primary all-purpose electric energy solution for residence / commercial sectors? ___________**in summary,** i totally understand the doubts and uncertainties that many people have with buying $tsla stock, and even tesla cars. many investors see the p/e value and call it inflated / in a bubble. folks, this is futuristic, groundbreaking and developing technology. perhaps, just maybe, there are other metrics to gauge a stock then? i recommend reading tesla's engineering news, not just financial reports, to gain a clearer picture. due to some of musk's social media antics, the stock has become a meme stock / robinhooders joke stock (lol). all this time that tesla invests into its growth and r&amp;d (instead of profits), will pave the way for it to produce a leading, refined product in the ev sector. and yes, i did read elon's email about profits earlier today. please share your thoughts. thank you for reading.",2,1,Why I am bullish on Tesla long term.,Finance

2935,"amarin corporation plc (nasdaq:amrn) today announced that the chinese society of cardiology (csc) has included icosapent ethyl in its updated guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases for 2021 as published in the *chinese journal of cardiovascular diseases*. the guideline authors include “icosapent ethyl 2 grams twice a day (as studied in reduce-it®) as a treatment consideration to further lower atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd) in the appropriate patient population.”1  “inclusion of icosapent ethyl in the csc treatment guidelines further validates the increasing independent support and acceptance of this unique drug to reduce cardiovascular risk,” stated craig b. granowitz, m.d., ph.d., senior vice president and chief medical officer of amarin. “importantly, these updated guidelines also support that the preventive effect of omega-3 fatty acids on ascvd is not only related to the dose, but also to the type and formulation of omega-3 fatty acid and incorporates findings from the reduce-it cardiovascular outcomes study of vascepa®.”“with this new recommendation, icosapent ethyl is now included in the treatment guidelines or otherwise recommended for use by 13 medical associations internationally, solidifying its role as an important treatment option beyond cholesterol management for millions of patients worldwide at risk for a cardiovascular event,” added dr. granowitz. similar to europe, where the european society of cardiology and the european atherosclerosis society added icosapent ethyl to their medical treatment guidelines prior to completion of the ongoing regulatory submission and review processes for vascepa (icosapent ethyl), csc inclusion of icosapent ethyl in its updated treatment guidelines has been made separate from and in advance of completion of the analogous regulatory processes for vascepa in china.in november 2020, amarin shared positive, statistically significant top-line results from a phase 3 clinical trial of vascepa conducted in china by amarin’s partner, edding. the study, which investigated vascepa as a treatment for patients with very high triglycerides (≥500 mg/dl), met its primary efficacy endpoint and demonstrated a safety profile similar to placebo. this pivotal study mirrored amarin’s marine study in patients from the united states and other countries and showed consistency across the chinese and non-chinese study populations. these findings will provide support as edding progresses towards and through the next steps of regulatory submission and review of vascepa for potential approval in mainland china.the csc recommendation is classified as a category iia recommendation denoting that icosapent ethyl is useful and effective and should be considered for treatment of at-risk patients. the classification is an evidence level b recommendation which reflects that the evidence comes from a single randomized trial or multiple large non-randomized studies. csc cited that its recommendations are supported by the results of the reduce-it cardiovascular outcomes study. the csc does not provide endorsements of any brand name commercial product. accordingly, csc guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases reference icosapent ethyl. the csc guideline does not reference vascepa, the brand name of icosapent ethyl in the united states, and such guideline should not be construed as an endorsement or approval by the csc of vascepa.amarin acknowledges the rigor with which the guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases are crafted and approved by the csc, which is comprised of leading medical professionals in china who specialize in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease.&amp;#x200b;**about hypertriglyceridemia in china**  there were approximately 180.4 million hypertriglyceridemia (htg) patients in china in 2019, representing approximately 20.2% of the adult

3310,"to preface, i'm a 20 year old college student who just started to invest in august. i have no debt currently and won't have debt upon graduating (unless something changes or happens in the next year.) i had about $7,000 in the stock market - $6,000 in my ira and $1,000 in a brokerage account - which has grown to $7,600 as of today. i'm going to max out my 2021 roth contributions once i start working again. i recently read one of the posts here regarding diversification vs. hand-picking stocks. the insight i gained was: at my level of risk and the amount of money i have, i won't really see any gains if i continue diversifying and spreading myself thin. it'd be better to do research on one or two companies, be sure-fire in them, dump my money there and hold until it goes up. that idea seems really enticing to me and i might give it a shot. though, i'm still a little iffy about it. i was thinking of doing some middle-ground where about half of my investments, i place into one of these companies and the rest i leave in etf's/mutual funds. does anyone have any thoughts on this? it's just a little confusing because generally, all i've heard since the very beginning was to diversify - but now, it actually makes a lot more sense to be doing something like this because i can stomach the risk.",18,1,Diversification vs. Hand-picking,Finance

company working to change how we experience watching sports and make it better.* i am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. these are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion.hi everyone, thanks for coming back for part 2. if you missed part 1, you can read it [here.](https://onthemarkpicks.com/2020/11/30/deep-dive-1-part-1-of-2-draftkings-bringing-sports-to-life/comment-page-1/#comment-1) i’m excited to bring you the rest of my research on draftkings (nasdaq: dkng). let’s dive in.**can we 10x from here?**for someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon, and probably you if you are reading this, an important question to ask yourself is “do i think this investment could 10x from here?”. in other words, could this investment one day be 10 times what it is worth today? to try to answer this question, i will work through a pre-determined framework that i believe gives us the best path to find out.the framework includes:1. leadership – desire, purpose and ownership2. risk considerations3. price considerations4. explosive business growth**1. leadership – desire, purpose, ownership**for a company to do something as spectacular as 10x, we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership. in chris mayer’s excellent book “100 baggers”, he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “owner operators”. by this he means that the ceo of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves. why is this important? if the ceo has their own personal wealth at stake in the company’s stock (just like we do as shareholders) their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that ceo had no skin in the game. it’s also better in my opinion if the ceo of the company was also the founder of the company. for these founder-ceo’s that have money invested in their own company, it really is like their baby. would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid (the company)?having one founder in leadership is good, but how about three? you have to love that. these guys worked together to start this company 8 years ago, and today they hold the three highest positions within the company. jason, matt, and paul were all co-workers at vistaprint in 2012. vistaprint is a global e-commerce company that produces physical and digital marketing products for small and micro businesses. all three of them studied computer science/engineering in college with matt and jason picking up an additional majors in business/economics. this makes sense as matt and jason are ceo and president while paul is head of global technology and product. at vistaprint, they worked in various analytics and marketing roles and became good friends. they had a passion for fantasy sports. they liked season long fantasy sports, but saw a big opportunity in daily fantasy sports. they went to work right away on building a digital platform for daily fantasy sports from a spare bedroom in paul’s watertown, massachusetts apartment. talk about humble beginnings.i think that founder/ceo jason robins has really shown that he can take care of his baby and lead it to big wins. over the past 8 years, he has successfully lobbied in multiple us states for legalization of dfs and sports betting. he has helped dk obtain key partnerships with major sports leagues including becoming the official dfs partner of the nfl in 2019. at the time of the deal, jason was quoted in an article in the legal sports report by eric ramsey as saying:“throughout our discussions with the league, it was evident we share a common vision around the future of fan engagement, and we are excited to continue on this unique journey with the nfl as our ‘official daily fantasy partner” and calling it “a defining moment” for the industry.it’s very important that the ceo of a company like this, trying to essentially create a new industry in the united states, is tactful at getting deals done with key business partners and lobbying for change with the government. i believe this bodes well for dk’s future.also, jason is very respected and admired by his employees. on glassdoor, he has  a 99% approval rate. i’ve honestly never seen a ceo with an approval rating that high. i think this strongly corroborates my thesis that he is a great leader.also, draftkings has very happy customers. using net promoter score (nps) which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend. for dk, their nps is extremely high and is substantially better than their main competitor – fanduel. on a scale of -100 to 100, dk has a 71 nps, while fanduel has a 54. this is a testament to leadership’s commitment to creating a great user experience. it really shows that company leadership can follow up on their word and deliver what they promise.in terms of leadership, owning their company, jason owns about 4.3% of the company worth about $880 million at the time of this writing. fellow co-founders matthew kalish and paul liberman both own about 1.8% of the company, with their stakes each worth about $350 million. i think it’s fair to say that these guys are invested in the success of the company that they started and are motivated to grow their company’s worth for themselves and shareholders.**2. risk considerations**my investing strategy is to buy companies of high quality, that are growing at a rapid pace, and then hold my position in those companies for a long time (5, 10, 15 years or longer) as long as i continue to stay satisfied with that companies’ ability to execute their business plan and have productive quarters that meet or exceed expectations. it’s not “buy and hold”. it’s “buy and continuously verify”. if you are going to take this strategy, you have to understand the difference between risk and volatility.to me, risk is the possibility that i can lose my entire investment. as long as i am not trading on margin (i don’t) or short selling (i don’t) the most i can possibly lose when i buy stock in a company is 100% of my money. the risk i’m taking on is 100%. but what is my upside? is my upside limited to 100%? of course not. i can invest $10,000 into a company and it can grow to $100,000 (1,000%) or it can grow to $1,000,000 (10,000%). there’s really no limit. volatility is a natural side effect of being a rapidly growing, disruptive company, that at times the public may struggle throwing a valuation on. it’s your ability to sit through these wild price swings while maintaining conviction in the company’s long term prospects that will allow you to possibly experience a 10x or maybe even a 100 bagger.can we completely eliminate risk? no. but i do think there’s ways we can go about reducing it with our investments. before considering a company for investment, i have a list of a few questions i go through to see if there’s any red flags that i think could make the investment too risky for me.*question 1: is the market cap under $1b?*no. dk’s market cap is $20.5b. companies under $1b market cap are small/micro cap companies. penny stocks fall in this category. to me, companies this small are riskier because they haven’t built up enough credibility to get big time financial backing, they’re less known by the public, and less scrutinized by the public than larger companies.*question 2: is there one customer that accounts for over 10% of revenue?*no. dk had 1,021,000 monthly unique players (“mups”) during q3 2020, which is up 64% yoy compared to q3 2019. i seek to avoid customer concentration because if something goes wrong with that one customer or they lose them, it could have a materially negative impact on the business. luckily, with dk we don’t have to worry about this.*question 3: is the company a turnaround story that was recently struggling?*no. dk was founded 8 years ago (2012) and has been on an upward trajectory ever since. as a matter of fact, dk was founded 3 years after fanduel (2009) and did a great job of not only catching up to them but surpassing them on many metrics. i’ve used both and can honestly say i enjoy dk a lot more. since they were listed on the nasdaq on april 24, 2020 the stock is already up 160% from around $19.*question 4: is the company in an industry that is set to decline?*no. i don’t think i need to write too much about this. ultimately, dk is a digital entertainment platform. common sense should tell you that’s a good industry to be in right now.**3. price considerations to 10x**in this part of the framework, i want to focus on the price and the path to 10x from the current price. as of this writing (11/30/20), the market capitalization (market cap) of dk is $20.5b. for those of you that are new investors, i’ll give you a quick breakdown of what this means.market cap = shares outstanding \* price per shareso if company x has issued 1,000,000 shares, and each share is trading at $50, the market cap of company x would be $50m. for reference, this would be a very small company (a micro-cap) that you or i have probably never heard of.the market cap tells you the total value of the company as a whole on the stock market today.to achieve 10x in 10 years, a stock will need to have a compound annual growth rate (cagr) of approximately 26% per year on average for each of those 10 years. this would obliterate the s&amp;p 500 which has averaged roughly 13.5% per year the past 10 years.now back to dk. in order for dk to 10x in 10 years from this current point ($20.5b) it will have to reach a market cap of roughly $205b by the year 2030. for reference, disney (dis), has a market cap of $268b as of today. disney might be a good investment, but they’re not going to be worth $2.68 trillion dollars in the next 10 years. size of the company matters when trying to 10x. for reference, the highest valued company in the world right now is apple (aapl) at $2 trillion.disney is considered the gold standard of the entertainment industry. but keep in mind, disney’s position in entertainment is well established and if anything, would really be declining in the current macro environment if not for their disney+ streaming service. even one of the oldest leaders in entertainment like disney realizes the value of having a digital entertainment platform. however, with the disney story being very mature and in it’s golden years, the dk story is in the early innings. better yet, to quote dk ceo, jason robbins from the q3 earnings call, the sports betting part of dk’s business is “in spring training”. for those of you who don’t follow baseball, “spring training” means that the season has not even started yet. the entire premise of dk as a company in my mind is that they are a digital entertainment platform. with the current world macro environment including the immediate and long term impacts of the covid-19 pandemic, i believe digital entertainment platforms (especially ones where you can win money) are primed for success. i know it’s a bold prediction to say a stock is going to 10x in 10 years but i believe dk does have a long enough runway for that type of growth to occur. speaking of growth, let’s talk about that a little more.**4. explosive business growth**we’ve talked about the path for the stock price to 10x, but a necessary ingredient for that to possibly happen is explosive growth. i like to see that top-line revenue is expected to grow at least 20% for the next five years. it’s this type of growth that makes companies that appear very expensive today, actually not as expensive as they look. personally, when i’m evaluating a growth stock, the first thing i look at is the price to sales ratio (p/s). the formula for this is simple:price to sales ratio (p/s) = market cap / last 12 months of revenuefor dk, the current p/s ratio is $20.5b / $550m\* = 37\*\*to get $550m, i took pro forma jan 1 – sep 30 revenue of $320m and added projected q4 revenue of $230m from the q3 earnings call.to be fair, a p/s ratio of 37 is quite high. it means that as a shareholder, you are paying $37 for every $1 of revenue the company generates. and that’s before considering expenses. you might be saying, “mark, that’s outrageous, why the heck would i pay $37 just to make $1 of sales?”. the answer is one word – growth. by taking a stake in dk today for the long term, you’re essentially banking on two things.&amp;#x200b;1. revenue will grow rapidly over the next few years to      make this ratio more reasonable2. investors in the future will still be willing to pay a      premium to have a stake in dk (maybe not a premium as high as $37 for $1      of sales, but a premium nonetheless).in terms of explosive growth, it has been so far, so good for dk. in the most recent quarter (q3) ending 9/30/20, revenue was $133m which is up 42% from the same quarter in the prior year. analysts are expecting a similar trend to continue over the next five years, they forecast at least 20% growth each of the next 5 years.if the market cap stays exactly the same as it is today ($20.5b), then the p/s ratio by the end of 2025 will be roughly 7. that is a lot more reasonable than what you see today at 37. however, the market cap is not going to be exactly $20.5b by the end of 2025. too many things will have happened by then (hopefully mostly good things) for the company’s worth to be exactly what it is today. with all the runway for growth here, if management can execute, and actualize these impressive projected growth rates (or maybe exceed them?) i think investors will still be paying a high premium to have a stake in a company like dk.will investors still be paying a 37 p/s ratio five years from now? probably not, but it’s interesting to look at what the company’s value would be if that were the case.37 \* $2.8b sales = $104b.i don’t think it’s realistic to think investors will still be paying that high of a premium, but maybe the premium will be somewhere between what it is today (37), and what it would be with no price change (7). this is me just speculating and guessing for fun, but lets take the mid-point of that range (22) and see where it gets us.22 \* $2.8b sales = $62b.  this would be roughly a 300% return in 5 years under these assumptions with a cagr of 25% per year. not too bad! again, take this part of the write up with a grain of salt as i am making a lot of assumptions and doing a lot of speculation here.this concludes part 2 of my draftkings deep dive. hope you enjoyed and be sure to stay tuned for the next pick and

6094,"**millennials have it tough**everyone knows millennials have it hard. they are drowning in student loans, which are not dischargeable under bankruptcy, and are paid wages that have stagnated for decades. even for the lucky ones who have graduated and are making enough to pay down their student loans – a moment of silence for the *millions* who [took on student loans but never graduated](https://www.npr.org/2019/07/18/739451168/i-m-drowning-those-hit-hardest-by-student-loan-debt-never-finished-college) – their loan payment often replaces what would have been a mortgage.just as well, since housing prices have increased 150% more than inflation since 1971, putting home ownership out of reach for most of the generation. and while wages haven’t kept up with rising home prices, rents have come fairly close, which means that almost half of those 18-34 are *rent burdened –* spending [more than 30% of their income on rent.](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/09/millions-of-millennials-are-locked-out-of-homeownership-heres-why.html) not all millennials are so burdened with rent, as a third of millennials live with their parents – more in states with higher rents, like new jersey, [where almost 47% of millennials still live at home](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p20-579.html).all of this means that a full two-thirds of millennials have zero in retirement savings, and 72% have less than $1000 dollars in savings of any kind. most of the generation is living paycheck to paycheck, so lets hope the economy doesn’t fall into recession anytime soon as [the next recession will destroy millennials.](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/millennials-are-screwed-recession/596728/)looking at the situation broadly, as a generation, millennials have had three major problems:* education is now incredibly expensive.* housing costs in particular have surged well over the inflation rate.* wages have stagnated for decades.**the root causes of millennials’ woes**while the issues facing millennials are discussed ad nauseum, the root causes of these issues are rarely discussed and are not as fully understood as they should be.***the demographic upheaval***much of the stagnation in wages is rooted in the stunning and totally under-appreciated demographic changes of the last half century. wages have stagnated in large part because of the massive labor supply shock caused by the population increase from the baby boom, the integration of asia into the global economy, and the integration of eastern europe with the fall of the ussr.in simple economic terms, the price for labor is a function of supply and demand – and the last fifty years has seen a massive increase in the supply of labor. economists from the bank of international settlements (bis) charles goodhart and manoj pradhan explain in *demographics will reverse three multi-decade global trends* that:*between the 1980s and the 2000s, the largest ever positive labour supply shock occurred, resulting from demographic trends and from the inclusion of china and eastern europe into the world trade organization. this led to a shift in manufacturing to asia, especially china; a stagnation in real wages; a collapse in the power of private sector trade unions; increasing inequality within countries, but less inequality between countries; deflationary pressures; and falling interest rates* *.****the emergence of free-floating currencies***while demographics are a large part of the issue, the labor supply shock doesn’t fully explain the stagnation in wages, nor does it explain the increase in asset prices. this is largely the result of a major change to the global monetary system that occurred in the early 1970s. it was after this point that the link between productivity and wages broke down, and when the costs for education and housing began to rise faster than inflation.[https://imgur.com/a/r8a4zt9](https://imgur.com/a/r8a4zt9)between 1971 and 1973 the [bretton woods system](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/bretton_woods_system), which had dictated currency exchange rates since the second world war, broke down. nations began to devalue their currencies for competitive advantage. many nations did this to boost exports or to stimulate their own economies (for more on the mechanics of this see:[ why did china just devalue the yuan](https://www.cassandracapital.net/post/why-did-china-just-devalue-the-yuan)), and this was the reason for the start of the ever-increasing u.s. trade deficit. [https://imgur.com/a/iruukcu](https://imgur.com/a/iruukcu) the trade deficit, when combined with demographic changes in the massive labor force expansion, explains much of the stagnation in wages in the developed world. but the era of free-floating currencies has had a much larger impact on the world than merely creating trade imbalances.looking at the consumer price index (cpi) for the united states over the long term shows the immediate and sustained inflationary impact of the free-floating monetary system. most people today are used to the roughly 2% annual inflation. but before the current free-floating monetary system, such inflation only took place during wartime.[https://imgur.com/a/xyfczwa](https://imgur.com/a/xyfczwa)the new money from this constant \~2% inflation enters the economy through the banking system, with each new loan increasing the total money supply. because the new money enters the economy as a loan, interest-rate sensitive assets that people borrow to purchase, like housing and education, are the most impacted.[https://imgur.com/a/qkgry5t](https://imgur.com/a/qkgry5t)**the root of rising of inequality**interestingly, this constant 2% inflation effectively functions as wealth tax, but not on the wealthiest who are able to benefit by owning appreciating assets like stocks and real estate, but rather on the those who cannot afford to hold much of their wealth in appreciating assets, or who must pay higher costs for rent.this constant inflation helps to explain much of the rising inequality in the united states, as well as the rising costs for interest-rate-sensitive assets like education and housing. as the renowned economist john maynard keynes explained:*… by a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. by this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. the sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become “profiteers,” who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat.*a recent paper by mehdi el herradi and aurélien leroy, *monetary policy and the top one percent: evidence from a century of modern economic history*, lends empirical evidence to keynes analysis. analyzing the relationship between monetary policy and income inequality between 1920 and 2015 across twelve advanced economies, they note:*the last decades have been marked by a substantial rise in income and wealth inequality across the developed world. low-income households in advanced economies have seen their wages stagnating, while wealth has never been so concentrated since the dawn of the 20th century* *.*they conclude based on their analysis that:*the results obtained from both empirical methods indicate that loose monetary conditions strongly increase the top one percent’s income and vice versa. in fact, following an expansionary monetary policy shock, the share of national income held by the richest 1 percent increases by approximately 1 to 6 percentage points, according to estimates from the panel var and local projections (lp). this effect is statistically significant in the medium run and economically considerable. we also demonstrate that the increase in the top 1 percent’s share is arguably the result of higher asset prices* *.***understanding the root causes**if we are going to solve the issues facing millennials today, we need to understand the root causes of their problems. demographics are about to shift *strongly* in the millennials favor with the retirement of the baby boomers. but reform to the monetary system is urgently needed. not only because the system is now breaking down[ into currency wars](https://www.cassandracapital.net/post/the-strength-of-the-dollar-is-leading-to-a-currency-war-and-not-just-with-china) but because of the negative impact the current system has on inequality. and of course, while millennials have it hard, we should keep in mind that the boomers have their own problems – like the fact that [pension funds are going to be destroyed in the next recession](https://www.cassandracapital.net/post/pension-funds-are-going-to-be-destroyed-in-the-next-recession).",3,1,Monetary Policy is the Great Risk we face,Finance

6568,"**industry overview**domino’s competes in the quick-service restaurant (qsr) pizza industry with various competitors. the u.s. market is estimated to be \~$37.8bn and steadily growing.  this is the second-largest category in the broader $279bn qsr market. the qsr pizza industry is primarily comprised of delivery, dine-in, and carryout. unsurprisingly carryout and delivery are the two largest segments.domino’s is the leading market share leader for u.s. pizza delivery and the second-largest market share for carryout. the four industry leaders, pizza hut, papa john’s pizza, domino’s, and little caesars pizza account for 61% of the u.s. pizza delivery market and 51% of the carryout market.the international pizza market is more underdeveloped than the united states. domino’s is one of three companies with a global presence.**business overview**domino’s was founded in 1960 by two brothers. the two brothers initially focused on opening stores near college campuses and military bases. fast forward almost three decades and bain capital buys 93% of the business in 1998. a few years later, bain proceeds to ipo domino’s in 2004, and it’s been a public company ever since.domino’s has three different revenue segments:* u.s. stores* international franchises* supply chainwe’ll dig into these different business lines and how they all work.**u.s. stores**u.s. stores consist of both company-owned stores and franchised stores. roughly 6% of all u.s. stores are company-owned. these stores are typically used for testing sites for new innovation as well as training and developing future talent.there are more than 6,100 u.s. stores, with \~340 stores being company-owned and \~5,800 being franchisees. the \~5,800 franchised stores are operated by 777 u.s. franchisees. these franchisees are able to benefit from domino’s brand image with a low capital investment. the largest u.s franchisee operates more than 176 locations.domino’s has a rigorous process for u.s. franchisees. those interested in being a franchisee must manage a store for at least a year and graduate from its franchise management school program. this is successful as there is a 99% franchise agreement renewal rate. franchisees must pay a 5.5% royalty fee on sales and certain technology fees.stores must also contribute 6% of sales to fund national marketing and advertising campaigns. these contributions go into domino’s national advertising fund, which is a not-for-profit advertising subsidiary of domino’s.**international franchises**domino’s has more than 10,894 international franchises in more than 90 markets. the main source of revenue from these stores is royalty payments. domino’s top ten international markets account for 63% of international stores.domino’s grants franchisees exclusive rights to develop and sub-franchise stores and the right to operate supply chain centers in particular geographic regions. this means they can create their own domino’s in international markets. they control the franchisee options, the supply chain centers, and other decisions. these franchisees pay an initial one-time franchise fee and a fee upon the opening of each additional store. the master franchisee pays a continuous 3.0% royalty fee on sales,**supply chain**domino’s operates 19 dough manufacturing and food supply chain centers, 1 thin crust manufacturing center, 1 vegetable processing center, and 1 center providing equipment and supplies to u.s. and some international stores. the management team is continuously looking to expand and build more centers.domino’s sells food and supplies to more than 6,600 stores. domino’s believes that franchisees buy directly from them due to cost savings, efficiencies, quality offerings, and consistency. franchisees also benefit from profit-sharing arrangements with supply chain centers. this program offers participating franchisees 50% of its regional supply chain center’s pre-tax profits.**total addressable market**the global qsr pizza market is already well established with the biggest opportunity being in expanding in international markets and same-store sales growth in more established markets such as the u.s. one of my main concerns is just how big the pizza market can be. i feel as though the pizza market is already well-established, but domino’s talks about their fortressing strategy which is adding more domino’s stores within one area to improve on delivery times, customer service, and cost efficiencies (cheaper to deliver pizza the closer the customer), and other important areas.**competitive advantages**1. **brand**domino’s is one of the strongest brands in the world. they benefit from brand recognition almost anywhere you go in the united states and i’d bet it’d be similar in some foreign countries. there are definitely some die-hard domino’s fans and then there’s also your local pizza restaurants that arguably have better pizza than domino’s but these companies can’t compete on price. basically, when ordering from domino’s you know what you’re getting.2. **scale**since domino’s is the largest pizza company, it’s able to benefit from economies of scale through purchasing power over suppliers, can test changes on a small scale, and then roll these features out globally. scale also gives domino’s the benefit of operating leverage. as the international franchise store count grows, domino’s will collect royalty fees that do not require extensive operating margins so operating margins grow slower than international royalty fees giving domino’s operating leverage for this segment of the business. the same can be said for us stores that are not company-owned.**financials**domino’s breaks down revenue into u.s. stores which include company-owned stores, franchise stores, u.s. franchise advertising, then supply chain, and international franchise royalties and fees. other important financial numbers are global retail sales growth, same-store sales growth, and total store count. these numbers are all listed below.**2019:*** total revenue = \~$3.6bn* u.s. store revenue = \~$1.3bn* supply chain = \~$2.1bn* international franchise

in 2004. this isn’t random. domino’s has been able to build a brand and continue to expand in the u.s. and internationally while rewarding shareholders.domino’s has a share repurchase program and also dolls out dividends each year. this combined with revenue and net income growth is a good recipe for any successful company.domino’s also seems to be the original cloud kitchen model. many of its stores do not include seating which would increase capital expenditures. the majority of domino’s business is carryout or delivery.**future questions**1. **how long is domino’s runway?** domino’s is already a mature company with more than 17,000 stores worldwide. future growth will come from cost efficiencies and some store openings, but i feel like it’d be hard for domino’s to make a case that store count can double worldwide because of how many stores are already in existence. international store count can probably double at some point in time, but going from even \~11,000 international stores to \~22,000 will be a big challenge. the good part is that royalties and other fees associated with international franchises are basically pure profit since international franchises are operated by a master franchisee that takes care of all the headaches in foreign countries. through operating leverage, if the international franchise store count doubles, then the profit will more than double. domino’s only has a market cap of \~$15bn meanwhile companies like mcdonald’s have a market cap of \~$150bn. domino’s definitely has room to expand, so if i were to do a deep dive on domino’s i’d have to answer the question of how many stores can domino’s operate throughout the world.2. **what effect does uber, grubhub, doordash, and the food delivery market have on pizza delivery and carryout?** in the past, carryout and delivery were typically done by pizza companies. these companies often don’t have any seating in their stores and therefore benefit by having less capital tied up in stores rather than inventory, buying back shares, or paying dividends. families, college students, and professionals would order a pizza rather than ordering a bunch of different food from a chinese restaurant or whatever other food option there is available. how does the new wave of food delivery companies impact pizza’s delivery and carryout appeal? do families increasingly order from somewhere else instead of the pastime of fresh pizza delivery? are the costs of ordering from grubhub, uber eats, doordash too expensive for a typical family of 4? does the cheap cost of pizza relative to other options give domino’s and its pizza staying power in this new age of food delivery?**conclusion**domino’s is an interesting company that i’d have to put in the more mature bucket. it’d be interesting to figure out if food delivery is a net positive or net negative for domino’s and other pizza companies. domino’s has historically been a great investment for hopefully many people, but it might be too late for me. domino’s is already at the stage of giving out dividends to its shareholder base and that’s not what i’m personally looking for. i’m a young investor so i’m looking for growth and i’m not worried about short-term volatility in the pursuit of long-term gains.**fun facts**there are international domino’s franchises that are public companies. not all of these companies are specific to domino’s and these firms often combine various franchises into one holding company. but here’s a shortlist:* asx: dmp - domino’s pizza enterprises* bmv: alsea - alsea* l: dom - domino’s pizza group* l: dpeu - dp eurasia* ns: jublfood - jubilant foodworksdomino’s has very different food options depending on local customs. some of these were highlighted throughout domino’s 10-k such as the mayo jaga in japan (bacon, potatoes, and sweet mayonnaise), the saumoneta in france (light cream, potatoes, onions, smoked salmon, and dill), and some others. i thought these were funny and it’s always interesting to learn more about different customs in foreign markets.if you want more updates visit [weekly10k.substack.com](https://weekly10k.substack.com/). if you made it

6697,"tl:dr: i left over 15k in loans on the table when they could have been in the market making money for me. and i'm hating myself for being financially illiterate at the time.i'm sitting here painfully regretting the money i left on the table in student loans. my mom receives ssdi and had no income. so i received max pell grant, along with plenty of other school wide grants including a $500 a month stipend for up to six years for a first generation grant.as a black man and first generation student, i was always taught that loans were bad and stay away from them unless you really really needed it. (i can't blame those that told me this) but that wasn't the absolute best advice.i did end up having to take out about 14k in loans (even that was begrudgingly at the time) to finance myself through college as i had no financial support from my mom whatsoever.but now that i look back on college, i realized i will never in my life have that much access to capital without being exposed to interest for such a long period, in my life. i ended up leaving about 15-20k in loans on the table. truth be told it would be more, because you could apply for additional loans through the school that would have not been due until after graduation.it's water under the bridge now, but in the event my children do not need their loans to live or pay for school i will convince them to take them and at the very least, put them in an index and let it sit for 4-5 years while you're in school. pull it out pay the loans back, and they'd have themselves a nice little 2-3k graduation present. and that's on the super conservative tip. (maybe i'll do it for them and gift it to them as a grad present, perhaps match it if it doesn't get too high)any young guys in college reading this... if you don't need that loan money to survive and you have a tiny bit of discipline, max out those loans baby!! put them in voo or some other index at the very least.",6,0,Invest your student loans!,Finance

6928,"i'm wondering if i'm making a mistake in terms of how i'm thinking it's pretty safe to put as much money you want into 529 plans which are used for education. the way i've thought about it, in some cases, it could reduce the overall income tax burden on investment gains or at least be close to breaking even.i'll be in the 35-37% federal tax bracket for the foreseeable future. i eventually plan to pass on much of what i've accumulated to my children. so, my thinking is this what would happen to unused money in 529 plans: if money is withdrawn from a 529 for a non-qualified distribution by the beneficiary (my child who will be in a lower income tax bracket), they would have to pay: 10% penalty on the earnings + whatever % income tax bracket they're in (let's assume 10-12% if they're withdrawing &lt;$40k/year while they are still a student, without income). so then the taxes paid on the investment income would be 20-22%.on the other hand, if i invested the funds in a regular stock account, depending on trading strategy, i'd either pay 35-37% short term capital gains taxes or 15-20% long term capital gains taxes. of course, there's more flexibility for what to invest in in a stock account, but if we just use an s&amp;p 500 index fund for both the regular stock account and 529, then at worst, the 529 plan would cost an extra 2% on income, right? if someone's children end up using the invested amount and gains for qualified education costs, then there would be at least a 15-20% capital gains savings.so even if one is not sure how much college will cost in the future or how much schooling someone's children will end up doing, one should not fret too much about putting too much into a 529, correct?(this of course assumes no major changes in the tax code over the next few decades)",9,1,Safe to purposely put excess funds into 529 plans?,Finance

27,"backstory: im a first generation american born in nyc and have been living here ever since. i come from a blue collar family and it was drilled into from an early age to go to college and finish a degree. following the advice of my parents, i enrolled in college but always felt like it wasn’t for me. ultimately, i decided to pick up a job as a plumber’s helper between semesters of my sophomore year and haven’t looked back since. since then: i’ve been lucky enough to continue with my parents and build up a little nest egg. (almost at my 2 year mark of working full time). $16000 in a roth ira $9000 in a taxable brokerage $18000 in a high yield savings account.

545,"hi everyone, i am 20 years old living in nyc. currently a full-time student going to an honors college that pays my tuition, as well as being a full-stack developer when i am not in school.i am really stuck wondering if my pursuit of fi is stripping me from my identity. i grew up an athlete who was gifted academically. i played baseball since i was 4 or 5 years old all the way until my sophomore year of college when i quit my division ii institution's team to work more since i had lost $8k in the stock market during the spring of 2019 and it made me feel like if i didn't work i was screwed. i still had about $20k in cash, but i always told myself not to spend it. to put a little context on why i made those mistakes and put myself in the position to lose so much is because i live in an emotionally abusive household w a narcissistic father so i really am just trying to move out--which in nyc you need a lot of money to even think about affording a house. i made a lot of emotionally driven, and therefore hasty, decisions which cost a heavy stock market tuition.ever since i quit baseball, i have had an internship with a government agency where i am in my second year, they hired me at graduate salary when i am undergrad, already gave me a raise, and i am working on super prestigious projects for my resume. secondly, the entire office is essentially interns that got a job offer when they were in school. it is something that seems super promising for job/income security in the future--although i cannot say i would have sought to work there had i not been there already. i am not huge on office culture and the desk job scene, some days are worse than others, but if i were working only for a short period (i have until i graduate to make a decision--assuming they'd give me an offer) i can make do.the only gripe i have is that there is not a day that goes by where i am not thinking about baseball, or wishing i could be playing or fitting it into my schedule. granted, i did not enjoy getting up at 7am on the weekends to go practice, but after the practice it was alright. i have dreams about it, and when i see all my friends who i used to play with still playing it is gut wrenching.it feels like an almost impossible situation to make a clear decision on, because playing division ii baseball means i cannot have a job, and i can't take night classes, and i am giving all my free time up to baseball. i feel like a happy medium is just playing in a normal competitive league as i used to up until last summer, but i haven't been out there in so long and i've lost 20 pounds of muscle since i quit--it feels like a giant mountain i would have to climb.unfortunately, being a nerd and computer person, i don't naturally click with the typical college athlete anyways so i didn't form many personal relationships with my teammates which is one of the bigger reasons why it was to easy to quit, so it makes it even harder to get back out there when a lot of my friends wouldn't be there to throw a bullpen with, etc.theoretically, i could join the team back and play my junior year as if nothing happened because covid-19 cancelled the entire season last year (so i technically missed nothing), but that would mean quitting my job and living off of my portfolio returns, putting off moving out, and only having my freelance income sustain my spending.**current assets:**\- $28k brand new car i bought in february (fully paid off)\- $10k 2-year cd @ 1.5-2.8% apy (don't remember exactly)\- $20k investment portfolio\- $2k cash**yearly expenses:**\- $8-10k**current income:**\- $22-25k/yearmy goal was to have enough money to move out at or before the age of 25, but i feel like i am losing myself slightly. i really don't know how to figure this one out.**tl;dr** i am 20 in nyc and i quit playing dii college sports to pursue working for fi and moving out of my toxic household, but not a day goes by i don't think about playing sports and i don't know how to play while still working toward fi at the same pace since i would have to quit my job and i don't have too many people i can play with since i am not a typical jock athlete as most seemed to be at my age.",4,1,Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place (20M),Finance
548,"**intro**this sub often talks about the financial aspects of receiving a windfall, but i want to focus on the emotional aspects of inheriting a large some of money for those who are struggling with the emotions that come with receiving a large sum.  managing your emotions can be as equally important as managing your money and the two often go hand in hand. i would like to share a bit about two different paths that my brother and i took and share some of the emotional struggles i have had with receiving a large sum of money from a young age and how i manage those emotions. i hope that this post can help other people who might have similar feelings to what i have experienced.**brief background**when i was in my first year of college, about 10 years ago, my final grandparent passed away. my brother and i received a lot of money, about 750k each.  by the time i received full ownership of the money at 25 years old, it had grown to 1.2 million due to most of the money already being invested.  **what each of us did after receiving the inheritance**my brother has always been a hard worker and it’s something i admire him for.  he was working in a dead end job he more or less enjoyed, but that didn’t pay well.  he decided to pursue something else a few years after receiving the money and went for his masters degree. he now works at a stable job that pays pretty well and that he loves.  he lives in a hcol area and put down a large down payment on a wonderful house. when i was renting a room from him, he would leave early in the morning and get home later.  he probably put in 50+ hours every week and up to 60+ at times for the first couple of years.   as i said, my brother is a hard worker. there were many days or weeks that were very stressful and he was exhausted when he got home.  but now that he is more settled in the job, he takes off more from work to do the things he wants to do and indulges in some of his more expensive hobbies.  he has no intention of quitting his job and continues to gain a steady income.  on this sub, this is the recommended path. work like you would have done if you hadn’t received a windfall and enjoy the benefits of it growing.   for those of you like me who struggle with the recommended path i’ll share what i have done. i completed college and hopped around trying different jobs. first, i worked a job in my field of study.  then i worked in retail for a bit before i tried a different type of job in my field of study.  i ended up having a mental breakdown in that job.  my next career decision took me to a low cost of living country where i now work teaching english.for whatever reason, i have really struggled with working full time and adapting to adult life.  it could be argued that my inheritance has contributed to that as in full time jobs it’s really hard to stay motivated when rent and satisfying basic needs is not a concern if i leave my job.  it’s easy to transition the thought of “this isn’t worth it” into action.  it’s not that i’m a bad worker.  i always arrived on time to my shifts and rarely slacked off.  but after awhile in a job i start to realize the job isn’t really fulfilling and working for my mental health, and so i look for the next thing that i think will give me a sense of fulfillment.  therefore, i don’t know if i would have adapted to full time work even if i hadn’t received my inheritance.**guilt**there are some problems that come with receiving a lot of money.  i’m not saying these problems are worse than other peoples.  just that there are problems and one of the main ones is the feelings of guilt that can come from receiving a large sum.   over the years, i have felt a lot of guilt, whether from personal or societal pressures. i’m sure some of these aren’t only exclusive to people who have received money, but i still want to share them as i think they are pretty common among people who have received a windfall and are experienced to varying degrees at different times. here is a list of some of those things:1)feeling like i don’t deserve and didn’t earn the windfall.2)feeling like i’m wasting my potential if i don’t do something special with the opportunity the money has given me.3)feeling like my achievements are lesser than others.4)feeling like i have to solve other people’s financial problems.5)feeling bad for spending any of the money.6)feeling like i’m not allowed to have problems.include separate for not having to struggle like other people?**what has helped me with the guilt.**it’s important to work on these feelings of guilt because if you don’t, you risk the chance of making unintelligent decisions.  here are some things that have helped me in the past.1) it’s really interesting how we view what people deserve or don’t deserve.  people tend to think good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people, but the reality is a lot of life is random. so we might look at people working hard to get the same amount of money that was given to us and we feel guilty for not having to make the sacrifices they do. after all, we aren’t better than them so why do we deserve to not work like they do? but remember that the person who chose to give it to you deserved to give their money to whoever they wanted to. so i think it’s important to be constantly thankful for the people or person that gave it to you.  i feel less guilty when i see that money as something that was given to me so i could pursue whatever i want in life that makes me feel fulfilled and happy.  also, one of the things my therapist challenged me on is how to think about the idea of earning money. have i earned my initial net worth by showing up at a job and exchanging my labor for money? no.  but all the additional earnings that my investments make, is earned money in a sense.  not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that every dollar of gains is from money i chose not to spend, even when i could.  2) the idea of potential is often associated with career, but that is only one aspect of your potential.  but because people mainly focus on career potential, people will judge you if you don’t use your money to further yourself in your career or to start a business.  there is really only one potential in your life that i believe matters, and that’s feeling fulfilled and satisfied with life.  so do whatever brings you long term fulfillment and figure out what is truly important for you and distinguish that from what other people think you should be doing.  for me, it’s working for some of my own money while also having a lot of free time to pursue my hobbies and activities.  this obviously changes over time so just be aware that what brings you satisfaction now will probably be different even a couple years from now.  3) guilt about potential plays a bit into guilt about achievements.  it’s easy to look at other people’s achievements and compare them to your own.  when i compare myself to what other people are doing with their lives, it’s easy to think i’m not doing enough and this is amplified with the false belief that because i have the financial resources to do anything i want, it means that i could do anything in life. when really it means that i can pursue anything that i am willing to make sacrifices for.  it’s easy to look at another person’s income on this sub and think ‘wow, if only i put in the effort like that person, i could make 150k+ too.’ but in reality, you don’t know the true amount of effort that that person has put to get there, effort that you might not even be capable of.  you don’t know how many things that person had to sacrifice, the amount of stress they endured, or their goals that motivated them to achieve that level of income.but you know what you have sacrificed for your own personal achievements and they are things you can be proud of.  while it’s important to recognize other people’s achievements, it’s also important to recognize your own achievements and to take the time to be proud of them.4)  my first reaction, and maybe yours too, to hearing someone having financial difficulties is to want to help them.  and if i were to feel guilty about the money i have, i would probably feel obligated to help them out financially.  but constantly doing that would set me on the path to giving all of my money away and prevent me from reaching my own goals.  i have found that most of the time, people end up solving their financial problems on their own and are really just looking to vent. even just offering a listening ear is often a good enough way to help out your friends and family.now i’m not saying don’t ever give money to help people.  i think charity and helping out friends and family is noble and it is something i would like to do more of at some point in my life when i feel more income stable.  what i am saying is don’t ever feel obligated to give money to other people if you don’t want to or aren’t comfortable with it.  personally, i have my own financial and life goals and i’m not comfortable giving away large sums. but, if charity is very important to you, select an amount you are comfortable donating or donate some time to help out.  5) this can especially play off the feeling of not deserving the money you received.  so if you buy anything with ‘unearned’ money then you didn’t really earn that object and you shouldn’t be allowed to enjoy something that you didn’t earn.  but that type of thinking ruins the joy for anything that you spend money on, which is a lot of things in this life.  while i’m not advocating for spending without any care in the world, i am advocating for guilt free spending.   to help prevent overspending, it’s important to still have a budget no matter your level of wealth.  find an amount you are comfortable with spending per month/year and stick to that budget.  for me, i take out enough money to cover my basic needs and a little extra fun money, but i still leave enough to let my windfall continue to grow.  it can be easy to go over the budget when looking at your bank balance, but this is where a lot self-discipline comes into play.  this has serves two purposes: it prevents you from buying things frivolously and over time eroding your windfall.  and it also creates an artificial constraint where you begin to want to earn money.  as i said earlier, having such a large windfall has made money less of a motivation for me, but when i feel a constraint on spending, even an artificial one, it makes me want to earn money with my own skills.  the only exception i make is for important medical related things.developing some sort of professional skills is good and i really recommend any sort of skill that can be freelanced if you struggle with full time work.  it has been important for me to acknowledge that i wouldn’t have been able to pursue this kind of career path had i not received my inheritance.  feeling like i am still having to use my own skills to earn additional money has given me quite a lot of personal satisfaction.6) for the final point of not feeling like i can have my own problems. people are judgmental.  it’s a fact of life.  and people tend to look at those who have been very fortunate as not being allowed to complain about things or have their own problems.  but that’s not true.  are my problems as stressful as someone who has to worry about not making rent and barely being able to feed their family?  hell no! but someone having a more stressful situation than me doesn’t make my problems any less problematic for me.  so it’s okay for you to struggle with the guilt and other emotions that can come with having received a large windfall.   **conclusion**i hope some of the things i have written can help you a bit to navigate the emotions with receiving an inheritance or windfall.  i would be interested to know in what other ways you have felt guilty or other ways in which you were able to manage some of your guilt.",193,1,Dealing with guilt associated with receiving an inheritance,Finance

(sorry if this information is irrelevant. not sure what to include/exclude).however i'm not sure about the feasibility of this plan. it just seems so out of reach. not relative to my skill per se but rather where i am in life. i mean there are 9 people living in our 3-bedroom apartment, gangs in the projects where i live on any given day, dudes smoking weed in the hallways, piss in the elevators -- it truly is abysmal. i've watched countless, i mean countless, classmates go astray and assimilate into gangs, drugs, pregnancy , etc. by pure luck i managed to stay away from all of that.i think what draws me into the fields i mentioned is that they are highly quantitative and analytical and i am forced to try my hardest to excel. however, i am not sure how to go about anything really. i don't know anyone in any industry. my dad is a janitor and every uncle or cousin i know works a low skill labor job or has no college education. i fear that i will slowly but surely assimilate into that. i mean what makes me different?it just seems like my environment is getting ahold of me and this is precisely what i've been trying to avoid all these years.i'm really not sure what it is i need. really, if anyone (preferably those with similar experiences or knowledgeable on the matter) could offer some input or advice, i would seriously appretiate it.also, sorry if this wasn't really cohesive. pretty tired of writing from the semester.\* oh btw, i know the title doesn't really fully encompass the post but i just wanted to cast a wide net on the audience.",65,1,How to Rise out of Poverty?,Finance
17,"good afternoon everyone. this is probably going to be very long. but for whoever decides to read it all and reply i really appreciate you...i have a lot of alone time on my hands and it has caused me to think about my future and begin to worry...i'm 19 years old and i'm currently in school still. however i will be graduating may 2021, because i took a lot of college classes in high school, and over the summer to allow me to graduate 2 years earlier than the rest of my class. i'm pretty fortunate that my parents provided me with a car, education, and pay for my gas, car insurance, phone bill, etc. because of this i've been able to save all the money i earned from working in high school. i've always saved my money and didn't spend it on silly things. i also flipped sneakers in high school and made at least 15k doing so. i stopped focusing on sneakers when i learned about stocks in college. i had about 35k in savings, but lost quite a bit taking high risk investing in stocks because i'm young and wanted to take the risk but definitely made some stupid mistakes. it was upsetting, but i've accepted it. and i do not believe in having regrets, because i would have never known what would happen. i'm currently finishing up school and seeking an internship/full time employment. i'm currently collecting $150 per week in unemployment. i have a good amount of time on my hands that i've been spending at the gym, spending time with my brother, and family and trying to not think about money all the time and just enjoy my life now.however, i keep running into the problem that i'm having trouble enjoying things now because worrying about my future is always stuck on the back of my head. ultimately what i'm worried about is not achieving all my goals, and i have set the bar pretty dang high for myself. starting to realize it may be unrealistic can be upsetting, but i still genuinely believe in them all...anyway here's some more i'm struggling with... in about 5months or so my little brother will begin to drive and will take my car. my parents will help my purchase a new one... i can get a quality car and save my money, or i can spend about 15k of my own money too and get a very nice car. i currently have about 23k-28k, i'm not sure of the exact number. but buying a car will put me down to 8k-13k. the only con i see in this it will delay me a little bit from being able to put a downpayment on a house.i know dave ramesy would look at me like i'm crazy with this... i should probably just not put any of my own money towards a car and be happy with what i get. what i would get would still be a very nice car. but here is my ""argument"" i guess you would say for justifying the car purchase. the money i have is from working in high school and flipping sneakers. most kids my age spend it on alcohol, going out to eat, and overpriced sneakers and stuff. i saved all my money... also i feel like the money for a downpayment on a house is made mainly from my first steady paying job, not the money i made as a cashier in highschool you know?i'm looking for a full time job and i'm also concerned about my starting salary, and even salary after a few years. i'm living home with my parents and would save up for a downpayment. i guess it's time to get into my goals now. i really would like a nice house maybe 500-600k.. i know someone mentioned to me that this was a lot for being young and single at the moment. i don't believe in renting because i'd rather live at home and save money. and i don't want to put a downpayment on a house that i don't want to keep forever because i feel that is a waste of money as well... maybe not though because i could flip it... but also meeting a significant other, i'm not sure when that will happen. i'm planning everything as if i will have no financial help from them, but idk if that's stupid or not and adding to my stress. it's weird, i'm not sure if i should purchase a house alone and then try to meet someone, or meet someone while i'm still living at home. it's a little weird to have someone at my parents house.. i wouldn't want to jump into buying a house with someone if i'm unsure we will stay together forever you know?so after the downpayment, i would have to pay my mortgage over time... the price of the house would all depend on my salary... and i learned my salary would need to me more than my mortgage, living expenses, and also 6k to max out a retirement account roth ira.. and maybe even more for a 401k... i know i haven't been successful with stocks really, but i learned a lot and i'm ready to stop making high risk dumb decisions and get serious with etfs and high quality companies consistently investing in a roth ira. or some sort of retirement account as soon as i get my first job. now... after all these expenses i still need to be saving money for things i want to make me happy...  but like i just said... i had about 36k but lost 8k in stocks.... it was at one point only 5k but i tried to get it back all too quick and too fast which resulted in dumb decisions... i don't want to fall into that trap again... i've accepted the loss and see myself starting fresh now with 23-28k in savings.... also depending in the 15k car purchase... i'd like to start a roth ira/401k, but i think that would be easier with a steady income... i'm also wondering how everyone else invests? max out the 401k employer match, then max roth ira, then the rest of the 401k? and then i wonder if people have their own individual self brokerage that isn't a retirement account that they invest in too.. but yeahthe other thing, 2020 has showed us how unexpected life can be and just... getting a nice car now would be one goal checked off the list... and i could start to enjoy it now. instead of having to wait and possibly never getting it because anything could happen.but back to saving for things i'd want and that make me happy... i mean... buying furniture and stuff for a house and anything that needs to be redone needs to be factored in, and also i know i said i set the bar high for myself but a boat maybe like 20k... if i'm able to keep a large enough savings pool...also, i want to be able to afford starting a family, and being able to provide for my kids just how my parents provided for me and my siblings. i know i'm young, and for some reason worrying about this instead of going to the park and playing football with my friends and enjoying my life in the present...the best advice i got was.. as long as you take little steps everyday towards your long term goals you should be happy... all that is in my power is to finish up school which i am and save my money which i am... besides that i feel there's nothing in my power. i know i was all over the place, and this was very long. i know i set the bar high for myself and i know i'm already very fortunate. complaining that i'm only getting this car instead of that car, and worried i won't have a boat. i should just be thankful i have a car and stuff in the first place, but i'm still shooting for high goals... i don't mean to sound ungrateful. if you don't have anything nice to say please keep your comments to yourself. or maybe actually, knock some sense into me so i could stop taking things for granted. i hope some people could help my find clarity. thank you.",6,1,19 Years

218,"i already made a previous post yesterday, but seeing as i hardly got any interactions, i wanted to test my luck when there is more people active. basically, around 2 years ago in high school, i took out a loan for my mom in order to start building credit to which she agreed to pay it off for me. the loan was set to last a year for $500, and the payments where $60 a month even. being my mom, i took her word for it, and i went ahead and took it out for her under my name and under my chase bank account (i had chase savings + checking and bank of america checking account), i set up payments, and she had access to my account to which she would deposit money in it for when she needed to pay things online, for convenience and to pay the loan. every month, i would check to see if the payments where made, and for half a year, everything was running smoothly. so i stopped checking my account (it really was not mine, i only opened it for my mom) since i was dealing with school, sports, college essays, work, other typical high school things, and just worried about my bofa account (i know i could just check my phone, but it seriously just went to the back of my mind) anyways, fast forward to seven months after that, and i had just started my first year of college. all of a sudden, i get a phone call from that loan establishment, saying i was 5 months late on payments, and debt started to collect. i didnt have my number connected to the loan establishment, so either my mom gave me there number or they had to search for a way to reach out to me. needless to say, i went to check the paperwork, and after trying to check my chase account, it was closed and had been closed for quite a while. i assume they closed it after the payment bounced back and having a negative amount. i then confronted my mom, to which she was sorry and tried explaining what was happening. but the point is, she just decided to not pay it and screw me over by the sounds of her excuse. we dont have a bad connection, but that definitely ruined my trust with her. but this isn’t about us or her. this is about how i can restore or remove the remark from my credit report. i payed off what the debt has collected, and the account was closed, and all remarks where made to the credit bureau so my question is, what can i do? this one loan has been the cause that has caused me to lose out on many future loans and harshly impacts my credit. and the thing is, it is only on my transunion credit report. my credit for equifax and experian are both 689 and 701 respectively, and being a 20 year old i would say that is not half bad. but most banks only look at the transunion credit, and either deny me or raise my interest to stupid high rates. do i have to just accept the loss, and wait for it to fall off? is there a way to build my credit and make the bad report masked by everything else? every and all advice will be highly appreciated. i want to be able to refinance my car soon, but i know since my credit is so low (570), it might not be of much help. i currently only have on credit card, to which i just took out last month, besides my car loan",16,1,Repost: How can i fix my credit?,Finance

(waiting to hear back if it’s approved)but here’s the kicker: fall 2021 i will be in law school and not allowed to work for at least the first year. i plan on taking out student loans to cover whatever i don’t get scholarships for and my bills. but i’ll still have this va debt to pay? question: do i just need to add the va debt payment to my student loan amount to pay monthly while in school? also i crashed my car and my insurance won’t cover it (long story) and it’s 4k to fix.. it was a 16k car and i owe about 3k on the loan still. it’s a 2016 car. my plan was to sell my car before starting school bc i won’t need it and i want the cash. it doesn’t even have 40k miles on it. great condition other than the cosmetic damage to the front. question: how do i get money to fix my car? should i take out a loan for that?i’m looking for jobs rn but i can’t bartend bc i’m high risk for covid. i plan on working and saving as much as i can until i move for law school. tldr: my dumb ass wasted great bartending money. covid drained me. i have 5k to my name and a 18k debt hanging over my head. 4k in damages to my car to be fixed asap.. where do i go from here? how do loans work :( thanks i’m advance to any help. i know nothing about finances. i want to start saving and investing. but i just have no idea where to go or what to do right now.",6,1,24 ano found myself in a pit.

549,"hey everyone! i am new here, and i've gone through lots of threads so far and am excited about the wealth of knowledge y'all have to share.so here's my story:i'm 25, been employed as a teacher in orange county for 3 years now.i have lived in orange county for 7 years. six of those 7 years were spent renting a 3 bedroom apartment in irvine with my elderly dad, who is a vietnam veteran, and two siblings. my dad has been receiving rental assistance which reduces the amount paid by him to around $1200/mo.for the past year, i have lived in an apartment with my boyfriend in costa mesa. my family continues to live in the irvine apartment. there was not enough space for all five of us to cohabitate in the irvine apartment, and my boyfriend and i figured we'd take the opportunity to attempt independence. we pay $1800/mo. split evenly.a few months ago, my dad's rental assistance was reduced so that he now owes around $1800/mo. he has also just finished radiation treatment for throat cancer. in addition to his other health issues, including multiple sclerosis, it is important that i continue to live near or with him.given this change, and how long we've been in the area, and my recently acquired tenure at my job, we are interested in buying a home in orange county hoping for a monthly payment between $3k - $3.5k.my dad lives off of government assistance totaling around $45k annually.my sister (22) is putting herself through school for physical therapy with two years remaining. she does not make enough at her part-time jobs (especially during the pandemic) to significantly contribute, although she does pay the electricity bill at the irvine apartment.my brother (19) is receiving grants to pay for community college, does not have a job, is focusing on passing classes.my salary is around \~ $56k. i have a little over $100k in savings, but i don't want to drain my savings on buying a house.my boyfriend has two jobs and makes around $20k annually. he has a degree in marketing and pr but is deadset on getting a job in the skateboarding industry and despite his best efforts has not broken in yet. he may resort to acquiring a salaried position in his field regardless of the industry soon, but no telling when that would be. the pandemic has put a wrench in things for sure.i am working with a realtor, and have been approved for a $700k fha loan. we are looking for a 4 bdr 2.5 bath home (any style).we have viewed two homes so far, one in lake forest and one in santa ana. lake forest was promising, but the hoa is $411, which is a little high considering we won't be using the community amenities much.here are some of my considerations:1. we could go all-in on a home in the $500k-$600k range in orange county. there are some, although the neighborhoods will not compare to what we've become accustomed to in cushy irvine. by my estimates, closing costs + downpayment + other expenses could total $35k.2. i could buy a home that's big enough to house about half of us while the other half continues to rent an apartment. build equity, then sell and hopefully move to a house that can suit all of us within 5 years.3. we could buy a home in the $400k range way in the hell out there and i could brave the commute, but from what i've seen in other threads here, it doesn't seem like that's encouraged by anyone.4. we could buy a mobile home in a community with lot rent that keeps our monthly payment in or around the ballpark of $3k, although i've seen mixed opinions on whether buying a mobile home is just pissing money away or not.i know some will say, ""maybe you aren't ready to buy.""that may be true! however, if we don't buy, our options are to continue renting separately as we are, paying collectively $3600/mo to rent apartments, or we could move into a house for all five of us and pay just about the same. the way i figure, if:\- we've been here for 7 years\- i'm going to be here for a while still, on account of my job\- my father and i's incomes will be steady for the foreseeable future\- the incomes of my siblings and boyfriend should increase in the coming years&amp;#x200b;might as well build equity instead of putting our money in someone else's pockets, right?&amp;#x200b;so, what i'm hoping to gain from this community is:\- any advice you may have for a buyer in my position, who is a young first-time buyer who is only 3 years into their career and doesn't have a family history of homeownership to rely on for guidance\- any advice on buying in orange county on a lower middle income\- anything i'm overlooking or not seeing. i'm sure i sound ignorant and that's because i largely am. i'm reading and asking questions and such, but all of it is very nebulous until the process becomes tangible to me.\- any resources i can read/watch/listen to in order to become more knowledgeable about all of this&amp;#x200b;mostly, i just want to find a comfortable home for my family. especially in the case of my father -- after all he has been through, he deserves to be comfortable.&amp;#x200b;any advice is appreciated!",29,2,Advice for a potential first-time homebuyer attempting to buy in Orange County?,Finance

employment: $70k/year and monthly take-home is $3,800 as an entry level position. i'm currently not putting anything into the company retirement option (minimal employer match &amp; no match until after the first year, which just became available for me).expenses: credit card payments over the last year average to $1, 013/mo. debit card is probably another $500. these include misc. like food, gas, online classes, gifts, some travel etc. haven't exactly been frugal...on top of this, my living costs (car payments + rent) = $1,100/mo. i live with my so, our finances are separate but we're sharing costs. their name's on both the car &amp; apartment leases. student loans:$62.5k, in 4 separate groups (by year), interest rates are smallest on largest loans ranging from 5.3% on $20k to 6% on 10k. federal unsubsidized, all of which were supposed to go into repayment last august but are all in covid forbearance. i opted for extended repayment for flexibility but with intention to pay much more, the combined estimated monthly would have been around $400/mo minimum. i dislike the idea of paying this for years on-end and consider throwing everything i've set aside into halving this debt. however i wouldn't mind if the alternative means giving me a leg up on purchasing property/other long-term investment.savings:the reason i'm here asking for advice. i have low-risk stocks my relative setup when i was born for my college tuition, after which i still have about $15k in the account. i honestly don't fully understand them and don't want to really mess with it unless i'm emptying it all to put down on a house or similar. advice welcome. on top of that i have another $25k in savings set aside over this last year that was supposed to go towards student loans. don't have a designated emergency fund or retirement &amp; up until covid happened, i was plodding along with assumption that paying student loans was the best roi.other considerations:financial experience: limited, in case it's not apparent.  i do have good credit (fico score = 780) but not much credit history; parents were cosigners on my college apartments, they helped with undergrad tuition (loan in my name). i've never owned a car or had considerable loans/purchases other than tuition. my so owns the car. i've never missed a credit card payment, expenses are minimal. graduated with masters degree and i've retained employment through the pandemic so that's a big plus in my book. i imagine it'd be hard to get approved for a mortgage on my own, however see below on relationship.more about the job: i have a year at my company  but i'm looking to transition into my preferred industry that realistically i'd expect a pay cut to around $45 - $50k/year for entry level. the transition would be to pursue my passion and field of study. some of the current experience translates but pay cut would be inevitable (this would be worth it to me just for the job fulfilment alone).  with covid the sector is struggling a bit more than my current industry.  i have my masters degree but again no experience in the sector; i have yet to land an interview so may be some time before it materializes.relationship: serious committed relationship of several years; this is the person i want to spend my life with! have yet to combine our finances and could also use advice here. they make considerably more than me ($110k/year) so the combined income would of course change the financial landscape i've detailed above significantly. don't know their full financial situation but i believe they do have a few grand in credit card debt and they have the car ($400/mo for 5 years), no other major loans. we're late 20's/early 30's so naturally talking about big life choices on the horizon like marriage, moving &amp; buying a house, year off for travel etc. feeling a bit stagnant in our current living situation and looking to mix it up. obviously this pandemic changes things but feels like we're both doing solid compared to most. my industry is typically conservative (traditional office, work up the ranks &amp; earn license, limited time off, no remote work) which limits where/if we could move. in contrast my partner's is unconventional (tech) that allows for flexibility to work anywhere.so there you have it! any advice (&amp; criticism) welcome, just happy to have someone else's perspective. if you've read this far, thank you! i'm not very financially savvy, don't understand investing, real estate (or even taxes) so i'm a bit nervous to make a bold decision but also don't want to just sit around with my hands tied. mostly i just recognize that i have this opportunity of liquid assets and am much more fortunate than many during these times. i think about single parents or business owners who really are at the end of their rope; just feels like i should be doing something with my situation that others may never get.",1,1,"I've built up $40k in savings: investment property, open Roth IRA, or student loans?

1588,"hi everyone!i would like to start of by saying that i am not the parent but the daughter in this situation. i wanted to post here because i wanted to get insight from actual parents to see where their thoughts land on this. i am currently a fourth year in college and recieve a combination of scholarship and financial aid due to my parents not making that much money (both work minimum wage jobs). i am also first in my family to go to university in the united states.i have for the most part paid for college expenses (whatever financial aid does not pay) myself or have taken out subsized loans for expenses related to housing fees, student activity fees etc. as i am getting close to graduation, i have been getting quite anxious about paying off my student loans, i should have around $10k to pay upon graduation.i am living at home this school year to save money and also because of the pandemic. before this school year started, i asked my mother if she could help me pay the $800 school bill that my aid and scholarship did not cover this quarter. she said she did not have enough money and if it was any other time she would have helped. i know my dad would provide me the money if he had it, but he owes around $40k of money rn so i know he does not have the means to. being home this quarter though, i can't help but see my mom frivolously spending money to buy new furniture, a tv and jewelry. i even sort of tested her and asked if she could buy me a pair of earrings and she had no problem buying me that, but not helping me pay for my tuition. i've also noticed when it comes to the serious stuff like getting me braces, paying for our pet bunny's health expenses, my mom refuses to contribute yet she will go off to kohls every weekend and like spend $600 on random things that fill our house. a couple other examples is that my parents refuse to buy a washer and dryer and so they go to the laundromat despite having a built in laundormat space in our back porch. another more extreme example is that when our '98 car was stolen, my parents went two years without buying another car and made me get up at 4am every day before school to drop them off at work just so i had the car to drive to school and pick them up from work after (they def had at least $250 they could have put aside for monthly car payments + insurance).i also come from a south asian family and typically education is very important in our culture and parents will go through anything to make sure their kids have university covered so i am quite upset that my parents have not helped in any way. i also really want to attend grad school but have no idea how i'd financially do it since i don't get financial aid post undergrad. when i was a kid i remember asking them to start a college fund for me and my mom also said she did not have any extra money but def wasted money on a lot of other things for me. i kind of feel hurt that my parents (mainly my mom) does not seem to care about my education. they have however been kind to provide me with food and a roof over my head and esp. pay for my health insurance. i also have been working for the past 3 years doing internships etc. and have been saving money to pay off my loans and am about halfway there. hopefully applying to scholarships can help too.the part that gets me really frustrated is that when my mom starts complaining about money to her friends she says things like ""oh my daughter is in college..time are tough"" when in reality she does not pay one bit of it.so my question is, is this something i should be concerned about? should parents try to help pay for college if they have some sort of means?...or do i just sound extremely ungrateful and entitled? i know i hope to be a parent one day as well, and i know for a fact the first thing my kids are going to get is a college savings account.",15,1,Parental Assistance with College Expenses: Should parents pay for their child's college tuition if they have the means to?,Finance

3178,"already received a bit of suggestions from best friend and partner. could use some more help. that's why i'm here. let's cut to the chase. about my situation right now:* i'm 25. i'm a mtf transwoman. i have depression and anxiety. * i live with my mother, who feels entitled to every ounce of money i make. bringing up how she helped me get my car and my laptop and etc and that i owe her. i'm grateful for all that she's done, but i didn't ask for any of it. she ""graciously"" offered, but not really since it seems like that everything she does for me i have to pay her back. what's worse is that she's transphobic and refuses to acknowledge me for who i am. i have gone through millions of arguments with her telling her that the money i earn is my money but that doesn't get through her head, instead she yells and yells and guilt trips me and uses whatever emotionally manipulative tactics to get me to ultimately surrender my money to her..... this has worked so many times, more than i'm ashamed to admit. i can't let her win this time.... not anymore. this is my money that i want to use to change my life for the better and find that independence i never had... she's put me through so much mental trauma.* i currently do not have a job right now, as of today. so my work history is zilch. but i have 3 potential job offers. a hire event for one of them is tomorrow. in the meantime i doordash fulltime. i'm also trying to practice programming specifically in the area of front end web development. i'm hoping within the next several months i can at least try to aim for an entry level position as a junior web dev. i'm also going to start online college soon. i'm going into computer science. i'll be doing that part-time. i plan on maintaining 3 jobs, two part-times and the 3rd being my doordash.* i currently do not have a car. my last car was totaled in a bad rear-end accident, from which the $10k settlement is coming from. * my credit score is around 544 so it's terrible.  though my so's score is excellent, at around 700, close to 800. * i've been with my so for 5 years now. we are both desperate to move out from our parents' houses. she also does not have a job at the moment. she got let go from her last job. like me, she has depression and anxiety, although her anxiety is on a very severe scale. she's applying for unemployment and will be doing doordash as well. she is trying to start a business with her art that she's been wanting to sell. she also wants to try to get more commissions. she's just started and she's pretty new to all this. i told her i will eventually help her with a website. she does not have a car as of yet either. * my so and i are also both interested in investing. we want to establish a savings, put money for retirement. i'm more interested in a little riskier investing to potentially get great rewards. but seeing as in my desperate situation every last dollar counts and i'm not steady with a job yet, it's not a priority right now. * when i called the adjustor this morning and she explained to me and my mom over the phone that i was gonna get $10k, i immediately told the adjustor to direct deposit it into my bank. after the call ended, sure enough, my mom and i got into an argument. she said she demands that i transfer her all the money. i told her this money could really help me, that i put it into my savings and whatnot. she didn't care. she brought up how she helped me buy that car in the first place so therefore that money is hers. the argument continued till she offered me to keep what was left over after giving her 8500(the $ she helped pay for my car), i told her no i don't want $1900, she said fine $2k. i reluctantly agreed. then for some fucking reason because i double checked the math and realized that my settlement minus the $8500 leaves me with $1900, she then was like ""oh well then you get $1900 because i need exactly $8500""... fucking christ. and yes, i agreed and i hated that i agreed but i couldn't stand her voice as we had argued for so long. but after calling my so and my best friend who pointed out how much bs that is and bitch slapped the common sense right back into me, i realized that this is obviously fucked up and i shouldn't stand for it. * so i'm getting the money direct deposited into my account this monday, and i'm going to tell my mom that i change my mind, i'm keeping all the damn money that i got for my fucking accident! and i'll probably end up tell her to fuck off. there is a 99.99999% chance that this will result in arguments lasting hours if not days (which i do not even want to bother wasting that time). so i'm gonna give my mom an ultimatum: let me keep my money or i'll take my money with me as i leave this house.    * so if it comes down to the latter, and i'm forced to leave for the sake of my sanity and financial security, i need to know what my options are to get settled, to step into the world of self-reliance for the first time and how i can sustain myself and have a bright future from all of this. basically, i need to know what can i do to make the most of this $10k short term and long term.      * my best friend suggested that i buy an rv that's decent enough to live, sleep, eat, and work in. it's a bit of an investment up front but she told me it will lead me to paying less in rent per month at most rv parks.       * my so is open to the idea of us living in an rv but she prefers to find a studio or a house with enough decent space for her to work on her art business. i would love and honestly prefer that too. the issue with that is judging by our lack of jobs and job history right now, we won't qualify for majority of apartment complexes or rental properties for that matter. although my so's credit is great, her lack of job will definitely outweigh that good. &amp;#x200b;so this is just about everything that's going through my head right now. i'm pretty fucking stressed. i'm pretty fucking lost. i'm in a way grateful... in a weird way... that life has moved in a way to me receiving this generous sum of money. which is why i can't afford to lose it right away.... no matter what my entitled mom says. the worst thing is that she literally got over $100k from her mom's house, when my grandma passed away. she even told me months ago that once she get's that money, i won't have to help her with money anymore... such bs that she's changing her fucking mind and decides that it's not enough until i pay her back for everything she's gave me....some ""generosity"" that is.... &amp;#x200b;please reddit, help me out here. and thanks for reading....",1,1,"Receiving a settlement of around $10,000+ this Monday.

4065,"alright so i'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this but here we go, i have rather unexpectedly inherited roughly 250k usd depending on the day. i say unexpectedly because it was from a childless uncle who my entire life was a broke musician unfortunately passed away and turned out to be worth over 3/4 of a million dollars from some smart investments and well his own inheritance. he left this money to me and 2 family members making my cut \~250k depending on where the market lies. i guess for context i should mention that i am 23, a recent college grad and working in the software industry specifically for the us gov't. i also have had a rather finance savvy upbringing and my dad recently retired at 53 with a considerable sum of money and throughout my life he has taught me many things about saving money and the stock market etc, i guess what i am getting at is that i am young and obviously have much to learn about business and the market and money in general i have had some pretty regular exposure to it over the course of my life.i currently am about 5 mo into working my first real job in my field and am enjoying my choice in career. i have spent the last few months adjusting to things and starting to get the hang of being self sufficient, for the first time in my life i am fully paying my own rent, utilities, food, insurance etc and while it sucks to see how much of my paycheck goes down the drain to that stuff it makes me pretty happy to be financially independent and already planning for retirement. so as it sits right now about 230k of that money is invested in the stock market(assume that to be less after it tanks bc of stimulus uncertainty in the morning) and most of it is put into dividend stocks, energies and similar strong but slow long term companies, my biggest position currently being about 30k worth of nee, who coincidentally my dad used to work for.over the past month or so i have been getting much more interested in the stock market than i have before. this has been a crazy year and i watched this portfolio go from over 250k when i inherited it january down to 180k at the lows and now i am back around 230k as it sits right now. lately i have been thinking about how lucky i am to be this young and have this amount of money to my name and while originally my plan was to leave this account alone and let it get the (hopefully) 7% a year return that stock market (theoretically) gives and have it be well into the 7 figure range by the time i retire, lately i have been thinking that there might be better ways i could put that money to use.over the past few weeks i have been playing around with some of the dividends that account has accrued on some speculative investments and options with mixed results, although i am at a net profit currently, and while i think that is an entertaining diversion when i am bored, i don't really see it as a consistent way to grow the portfolioi guess my question is, is there any other options i should consider to put this money to work for me? was looking into swing trading and options and other market related plays and while i enjoy it i just don't really see it being a consistent revenue stream. was considering purchasing a rental property because the roi seems to be higher than the market in theory, and considering if i were to buy the house i am currently living in/renting and rent it out for the same price i'm paying i would make anywhere from 11%-20% according to some online calculators(currently paying $1400 a mo and the owner had the property listed at 149k before i rented it). my dad thinks i should reinvest a lot of the dividend stocks and mutual funds into some potentially stronger positions, personally being in the tech field i tend to lean towards tech companies was thinking mostly aapl and msft and some others (obviously i would put a lot more thought into this if i were to do it, just my initial thoughts) the thought of liquidating this account is kinda scary to be honest, especially considering the tax implications of it but i just figured i should really do some digging on my potential options going forward.i appreciate everyone who took the time to read through this whole post and give me their .02 on my situationthanks",29,1,"Inherited a considerable sum of money, What should I do with it",Finance

4550,"“price search” and “price comparison” don’t exist for college because their financial aid websites tell us their pricing process is customized around the unique financial needs of every family. tuition sticker prices are everywhere, and those are easy to compare, but only about 10% of college shoppers have the means for sticker price and end up paying it. the harder thing to search for is the “all-in cost after grants” because every college has its own financial aid office, its own endowment, and they all configure their pricing software differently. but financial aid awards are not “custom made” because there are too many financial aid packages for colleges to hand-produce every march (5m+ financial aid offers for new students).it turns out that most colleges use one of two software packages to configure the financial aid grant amount (elucian or powerfaids), and that the aid itself is algorithmic, performed in batches. but every college checks different flags in the software, and inputs different endowment amounts. some colleges work hard to arrive at large grants and a low “all-in cost” that signals how much the college wants the student. other colleges don’t put much work into this, because some students tend to show up anyways. for someone advising a student where to apply, it would be hard to catch this, since the colleges don’t put it on their websites. the key insight is that year after year, most colleges are pressing the same buttons in their financial aid software and delivering similar financial aid packages to students with similar family incomes. what this means for prospective students is that whatever financial aid packages a college configured two years ago, they are likely to do it again in the upcoming year.now gets to the neat part - if only we could understand what aid packages a college built two years ago, across different sets of family incomes. as a result of the higher education reauthorization act of 2008 ([https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019036.pdf](https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2019/2019036.pdf)), we can, it’s just really well buried in a database only well-known to financial aid gurus. they are called the grn4n32 and npt432 variables. these two pieces help us paint the picture: how many students are in an income bracket (say, $48k-75k), and what the average “all-in price” was that those students had to take out loans for (or pay the bill in cash, if they’re wealthier).this data can now be used to generate a high-impact application strategy where a student can target colleges on the all-in total cost they are likely to achieve, based on what students with similar family incomes paid two years ago. students can also save on application fees, because seeing how colleges award aid (generously or like the grinch) can allow students to avoid applying to badly priced schools. here’s an example of it working and delivering a potential $97k savings, using the search tool at [makecollegecheaper.com](https://makecollegecheaper.com/?utm_source=reddit) to return the grn4n32 and npt432 variables. both nyu and tufts are ranked #30 in the latest us news report (they are tied).  you can look at the third column, ""avg cost"" for family income $0-$30k, and see that 44 students attended tufts with families in the $0-$30k income bracket from 2017-18, whereas 657 students attended nyu with families in the same $0-$30k income bracket. because there are large numbers of students at both schools in that income bracket, we can see that the average cost being calculated from those samples is pretty useful. and now we can do some quick math: a student from a family income of $0-$30k could go to nyu and expect to pay all-in $29,080/yr, or they could go to tufts and expect to pay all-in $4,679/yr. tufts is a much better value; tufts has configured their financial aid algorithms to work differently than nyu. the savings over 4 years is ($29,080 - $4,679) \*4 = $97,604.",0,1,Why is NYU charging low-income families &gt;96% of family income per year?

4774,"hi! i’m a new parent, suddenly panicking about being behind financially. i would love some help figuring out how to set ourselves up for success if anyone has thoughts. apologies in advance for the length of this post!first, some context:i’m 40 and my wife is 39. i’m making $175k/year. she makes $60/year. we live in the bay area and are renting a 1-bed apartment for $2600/month. we’re planning to stick it out here as long as we can stand it to save money. we’re currently able to save $5,000-$6,000 per month. we have a four-month-old baby. when our parental leave is up in a couple of months, my wife will either quit her job or work part-time from home, depending on what she’s able to figure out with her company. i also work from home and can help her watch our son. we have no debt, around $45,000 in savings (i had a large increase in pay about six months ago), and around $50,000 in 401ks (we got started with these a bit late). i’m new to investing, but interested. i’m currently auto-investing $300/mo into an index fund, but i know that’s not a whole lot. i also own 6500 options for a pre-ipo tech company where i worked (it’s going public in 2021) and have another 6500 for the tech company where i currently work. both companies are projected to do quite well, but there’s obviously never a guarantee of anything with ipos, so i’m trying to to factor those in too much. our plan is to move back to minneapolis, where i’m from, and buy a house. however, i’m not eligible to wfh from another state until i’ve been with my company for two years, which isn’t until february of 2022. my questions are:1. since we plan to move in a couple of years, does it make sense to rent in the bay area until then? or is there any world in which we buy something smaller here to live in until we move, then either sell or rent it when we move? 2. assuming we continue to rent, the plan is to save up a sizable down payment on a house in minneapolis. is it best to just keep that money in a high-yield savings account until then, or is there something else we should consider?3. i’m feeling very nervous about retirement. since we’re late to the game, what’s the best way to build it fast? my wife’s company has a 5% match on her 401k, but mine doesn’t. we’re both contributing 10%. should we  contribute more? or invest that money in an index fund/something long-term?4. finally, we want to start our son off on the right foot financially, since time is on his side. not necessarily a college-specific fund, but something that will compound and grow, and that we can continue to contribute to. thank you for any advice you’re able to give us!",16,1,New baby = financial wake-up call,Finance

6495,"from reading other posts, it seems there's a pretty widely accepted rule of thumb that you should have 10-12x or 10-15x income in life insurance. but i don't get why that's the way it is.in my own situation, my wife and i (who don't currently have life insurance) are having a kid soon. my thinking is that i want this insurance primarily to cover the cost of bringing up the kid if one or both of us dies. thus we should get 20-year term life policies.to calculate how much we need, it seems to me that we should figure out what sort of income the kid would need, including college tuition and accounting for expected inflation. we've already discussed with family members who would take care of the kid if we both were to die, so we're not anticipating additional housing costs.as an example, we could anticipate a caregiver would need $50k a year before taxes to pay for education, food, etc. that would leave us at $50k \* 20 years = $1 million. then add let's say $250k for college and we have $1.25 million. thus my wife and i should each get a $750k policy. if one but not both of us were to die, the other person's $750k should theoretically take up the slack; we make about the same amount of money anyway.one flaw in this whole thing, it seems to me, is that the need for insurance diminishes as the term of the insurance goes on. the kid will need less of a payout at 16 than he does at 3, yet as far as i know there's no way to adjust it over time.another issue i see is that we have a bunch of savings that the kid would inherit, thus reducing the total amount he needs from insurance. should we simply subtract that amount from the calculated total above?we don't currently own a house, but i could see how if we did it might change the thinking, given that perhaps one of us would want to be able to continue paying the mortgage after the other died. should we factor in a prediction that we'll eventually buy a house that we'll want to potentially stay in?and finally if we had another kid in the next couple years, we'd obviously want more insurance. is it easy to just add on to a term life policy as you need to?am i thinking through this decision on the right lines? anyone have any guidance or suggestions?",9,1,How much life insurance do we need?

7022,"i (27f) consider myself a saver more than spender and would say i'm fairly financially-wise, but am a little torn right now as far as what my debt vs savings plan should be. i'm going to include all the details i think are important, so sorry for this being so long.financial overview: i went to a small private college to get my bachelor's and accumulated ~$33k in student loans. i've paid a little more than half of that over the last 5 years; my current principal balance is $14,600 with an average interest rate of 4.4%. i had one private loan that i paid off first, and have since been working on my federal loans. i pay a little extra every month and usually a small lump-sum with my tax return. i currently have 4 federal loans (previously 5; one paid off entirely) with the following balances/rates: $4k@4.1%, $4k@3.61%, $3k@6.55%, $2k@3.15%. i put all extra payments towards the 6.55% loan. for the past 7 months, since federal loans currently have no interest, i've been putting my monthly would-be payment into a hysa (0.5%apr) instead with the plan of making a lump-sum payment before interest is set to accrue again...and with pipedreams of loan forgiveness, which i know is incredibly unlikely. i've been keeping track of what portion of my savings is intended for my loans.i had been driving a 20+ year old car until i bought a new one in 2019. i know i shouldn't have bought new, but wanted to live a little (also bought a sensible vehicle). i put $6k down and financed $23k @2.99%. that balance is currently at about $15k. in an ideal world i'll pay that off early, too, but that's not my current focus.i have excellent credit (800+) and two credit cards. i use my credit cards to pay for basically everything to get cash back, but always pay the full balance and have never carried a balance. the only debt i have are my auto and student loans.i've got around $11k in savings, which includes about $3k earmarked for student loans. my current monthly base take-home pay is ~$2,400 with base expenses (rent, car insurance, car payment, student loans, utilities, etc.) of $1,710 + ~$640/month budgeted for gas, food, pets, miscellaneous expenses. i also work a second, part-time job which earns me an additional variable income of about ~$200/month net pay. i have $300/month put directly into my savings (i know i should be saving more) and try to put any extra money i may have into my savings as well. i try to follow a zero-based budgeting method as best as i can, but am certainly not perfect. i am actively seeking a new job which would hopefully have a yearly salary of $60k+, but of course i know better than to count my chickens before my eggs hatch.here's my question: i am looking to purchase a home hopefully in the next 6 months or so. i would be purchasing the home with my partner, who has about twice the savings i do, but a similar salary (also looking for a better job). my first instinct is to put that earmarked $3k and maybe a little more towards my student loans, but then i question whether i should prioritize saving for the cost of a home/downpayment. i know, either way, we'll almost certainly be paying pmi. i'm already slated to pay off my student loans about 2 years early, and i know i could just keep making my monthly payment once 0% interest stops, no harm no foul, the loans will still be there after i buy a house. especially with no interest accrual right now, it's very tempting to just keep the earmarked money in my savings. i could also just pay the $3k loan @6.55% which would bring my average interest rate for the rest to 3.85%, which isn't terrible. i also feel like this is the best time to attack my loans since there is no interest and i would still have enough in my savings for an emergency fund and a small amount to put towards the house, but i'd really like to have more in my savings. it's not like my student loans have crazy high interest rates, so the yearly interest isn't costing me a fortune, but i know the longer i take to pay off the loans, the more money i'm losing in the long run.any advice about what i should prioritize or maybe an alternate strategy i haven't thought of would be much appreciated. thanks in advance!!",91,1,The age-old question: Should I focus on paying off student loans or saving for a house?

7191,"i graduated in august and have been working in my degree related job since september. i’ve been looking around in investment opportunities so i can create some passive income. what my ideas have funneled into, is investing in properties to eventually rent out. me and my so’s (23 and 22) net income is $6200/month, and it’s very likely that will increase to $7000/month in a few months. currently, we have 0 debt between us. we had scholarships and our parents assisted with college expenses. we both have cars that are fully paid off through us working through college. we currently have approximately $30-40,000 saved between us. we live with my parents for now, so expenses are very low (only food/gas/helping with groceries).i guess my question is this. is investing in properties a sound plan at this point? i want to purchase a $160,000 house with a $40,000 downpayment in the next few months. with an estimated budget, we can afford to pay $3,000 per month towards the house, and pay it off in ~3.5 years, while having around $2,000 left over ever month to go to emergency funds, savings, or any other miscellaneous costs that come up. at the end of the 3.5 years we plan to save for another down payment and move to a more populated city with lots of job opportunities in our field, and rent out the first house. is this overly ambitious? is there a better way to make a return on investment that isn’t strictly “saving for retirement”. the overarching goal would be to do the same with the next house, and have multiple rental properties by the time we are 40-45. and at that point we would have a self sustaining income where we could essentially live how we wanted without worrying about losing our jobs or anything like that. any thoughts or comments are appreciated, thanks!",25,1,I graduated recently and I’m looking to buy my first house.

7604,"hello.if this isn’t the subreddit for this i apologize. i am just trying to get advice and perspective from people outside of my family. i know this is long so bear with me please. i understand i am very lucky to have grown up in the household i did, and i am fortunate this was even a possibility at my age. i live in northern california. during the summer of 2019, my brother and i went in together to purchase a house as co-owners in northern california where we live. at the time, i was 21 and my brother was 20. my parents had saved up during our childhoods for my brother and i to go to college. this money was in two separate accounts, one for each of us. he and i chose to go to trade schools and got scholarships along the way, so we never had to touch those funds. we decided to use these funds, about $40,000 each, towards a down payment on a home we’d be purchasing together. even with the two of us coming together, we were still short on the amount for the down payment, so my grandma gave us the rest to use for the down payment. we acquired the house and agreed everything would be split 50/50 between my brother and i: mortgage, utilities, bills, etc. our mortgage was $2400/month.my brother immediately moved his girlfriend into the house, which i was against. i didn’t want another roommate and he forced one on me. because she still had thousands of dollars left in student loans, she wasn’t able to pay rent or bills. the only bill my brother started paying 2/3 for was the water bill. this was the case from june 2019 to december 2019, so half a year. starting january 1, 2020, everything was split in thirds. april 2020, my brother and his girlfriend had a baby, so now it’s the three of them and me in the house. because of covid, interest rates were very low, so we decided to refinance the house with a different lender. this brought our interest rate down a considerable amount. we finalized the refinance in november 2020, and the original loan was paid off. there is no payment due for december. january 2021 starts the new reduced payment. i had applied for a new job in april 2020, and officially got the job. i start this month. i moved out of the house in northern california and got my own apartment in southern california where the new job is. my brother and his girlfriend are taking over the full cost of the mortgage and bills, even though i’m still a part owner of the property. i will be paying for half of the property taxes though. we also had our sewer lateral replaced this year, which we had to finance. we split the payment equally. one of the motives for us refinancing was to make it affordable for them to live on their own in the house. &amp;#x200b;my brother and my mom put together an agreement they want me to sign. here is the agreement they came up with. i have edited the document to exclude personal identifying information:we, “*me*” and “*brother*”, entered into a mortgage agreement together for the property at “*address*” on june 5, 2019. the original loan amount was $389,500, held with “*first lender*”. each party contributed equally towards the down payment.on november 23, 2020, “*me*” and “*brother*” entered into a new refinance mortgage agreement together, held with “*new lender*”. the new loan amount is $385,450. the new appraised value of the above-named property was $520,975.both parties agree that all equity before the refinance will be split equally between them 50/50 (the difference between the new appraised value and the original loan amount = $135,525) and both parties will recoup their portion of the down payment, as long as the value of the property allows.both parties agree that any equity after the refinance will be split 1/3 to ""*me*"", 2/3 to ""*brother*"", with the following exception(s):both parties entered into an agreement with “*plumbing contractor*” on august 21, 2020 for the repair of the main sewer line at the above property address. the original loan amount was $13,594.14, payable over five years. the monthly payment is $270. each party agreed to pay 50% of the monthly payment until the loan is paid off, or the above property is sold, whichever comes first. “me” will receive back 1/3 plus $45/month for each month of the total money he paid towards the sewer loan out of the new equity when the above property is sold. the upkeep and maintenance of the above-named property is the responsibility of “*brother*” as long as he lives on the property. both parties agree that any major repairs needed at the above property will be the responsibility of both parties in the following amounts: “*me*” will pay 1/3, “brother” will pay 2/3.all money due monthly for house payment expenses and sewer line loan will be paid out the joint checking account “*account number*” held by “*me*” and “*brother*” at “*first lender bank*”. surplus money held in the joint account will be used only for emergency house purposes agreed upon by both parties.“*me*” vacated the above-named property to live in “*southern california*” for his new job on december 1, 2020. “*me*”, as a courtesy, gave opportunity to “*brother*” to find a roommate of his choosing to fill the vacancy. “*brother*”, along with his live-in girlfriend, “*brother’s girlfriend*”, chose not to have a roommate, and would assume the monthly mortgage payment of principal and interest in the amount of $1599.20, with the first payment due january 1, 2021. “*brother*” and “*brother’s girlfriend*” are responsible for all utilities expenses at the property.both “*me*” and “*brother*” agree to pay 50% of the monthly property taxes and homeowners insurance due for the escrow account held on the new refinanced mortgage. the approximate monthly escrow amount $575, and both parties understand that the property taxes are not a fixed amount and may be subject to change according to city and county taxes, and changes in homeowner insurance premiums. “*me*” remains part owner of the above-named property and is entitled to the tax write-off as set forth by law. in the event that the relationship between “*brother*” and his live-in girlfriend “*brother’s girlfriend*” dissolves, or “*brother*” and “*brother’s girlfriend*” are unable to make the monthly mortgage payment, “*me*” and “*brother*” agree that the above property will be listed for sale and sold immediately.if either party decides they want to sell the property for any reason other than noted above, they must provide the other party a minimum of 90 days’ notice in writing.if said property is sold, “*me*” and “*brother*” agree that all equity money will be held in joint accounts with their parents, “*mother*” and/or “*father*”, until either party decides to purchase a new home independently. both parties agree the equity money is intended for the sole purpose of purchasing property.any future changes to this agreement must be discussed between “*me*” and “*brother*”, and a written addendum to this agreement must be signed and dated in front of a notary public.&amp;#x200b;i ask for advice on the situation. should we have this agreement looked at by a lawyer before signing? are the contents of the agreement fair for everyone involved? it is also my understanding that for us to sell the house, he and i both would need to agree to sell. this agreement however includes a way for me to sell the house if i wanted to as long as i give 90 days’ notice. what happens if my brother refuses to sell? will this signed document hold up in court? we will be signing in

7720,"hello, all. i apologize if this is not the place for some of the things i am seeking answers for, but i would really appreciate some objective advise from a bunch of strangers.i am about to be, let’s say between 30 and 34. i was kind of a late bloomer with college and knowledge altogether. i did not grow up in a family or household that taught you how to use money properly, etc. when i was young i received a fairly substantial inheritance from deceased grandparents i’d never met. let’s say $100k. looking at it as a, “gift,” and, “for college,” was drilled into my head constantly by the adults around me. i was never told or taught to invest this money, so it pretty much went as quickly as it came. now that i have a brain, what i did with that money is one of the biggest regrets of my life—especially because the year after it was mostly gone, i fell incredibly ill. i wound up having an autoimmune disease. i was normal one day and then had a period of a few months where i became almost completely disabled. i could hardly walk, breathe well, etc. and i was failing to be diagnosed. this went on for five years. five whole years of not being able to work. counting on family that was not financially secure, pretty much i almost became homeless. it was the lowest point of my life. i was lucky enough to be diagnosed last year and am now being treated and doing pretty great! i got covid and almost died, but aside from that, i am doing fairly well with symptoms management. while i was sick i did everything i could to learn about money, budgeting, and investing. i would say i’m not too shabby with knowledge at this point, but definitely am not an expert. my issue is, i don’t know what to do anymore to make money. i know that sounds kind of ridiculous. but i feel so lost from being...lost, for five years. now six because of this fcking virus. i have a bachelors in english literature (i now regret this, too) and planned to work in film. i was on my way when i got sick, now i don’t see how to get back into it because it’s not financially friendly, and i am no where near as privileged as i was prior: inheritance money, full health, young and able to work for free or peanuts while working my way up. i worked for a small company for awhile and was almost at management level by the time it ended for me. my issue is that i feel like i’m teetering on the brink of either complete ruin, or total success. as in, i’ve seen what losing everything looks like so i have a pretty firm grasp on what is important. i know i need money and how to do stuff with it that will benefit my future, but i’m having a hard time figuring out how to get there now. it feels like the choice is mine, but i don’t know where to turn or how to keep moving forward when all the doors i wanted to open are closed off to me. i also have this huge block of space on my resume, and it wasn’t that plump to begin with. i got sick only a year out of school and working.i know this is about job stuff, but it’s also about finances. job gives finances and...i hope someone understands what i’m aiming at here. i just need some advice about how to move forward and have the financial life i want and need. i feel like i am this very capable person, but nowhere and everywhere seems like my option right now. does anyone understand? and jobs are ridiculous right now. there’s barely anything being offered remote that isn’t a scam, and everything else is essential work that puts me at risk—especially since we don’t know the deal with being reinfected at this point. i’m sorry this is so long! thank you in advance to anyone to takes this on.",17,1,Financial Life On The Edge Of Everything &amp; Nothing: How To Swim Instead Of Drown From Here?,Finance

300/mth with current expenses but obviously would hinder my savings. i've currently been paying off 1000-1500/mth on my mortgage (payment is under 500) excepting my furlough for 4mths and during renovation spurts. plus socking away 2k a month regardless. &amp;#x200b;i don't know anyone personally who has financed a second home, and the one person i know who did was married with large incomes. ideally i'd pay off this house and then finance another, or buy outright but if the right house comes along.... is that even a feasible thing for a single person to do?ifso, what other factors besides credit score (\~740) debt load (75k for house and thats it) income etc?i haven't figured out what the plan is for current house is in 4yrs. i may sell, i may rent (3-4bdrm houses in my area rent for like 2k a month. lots of big companies moving here so prices are rising for the last decade) hell i may let my kids live there after i move as adults if they want. my urge is to find a house i love finally (my ideal is 20's era bungalow with as much original features as i can get) and do work on it while i have my current house so i'm not dealing with the renovation hell i've been in for the last couple years. lol. added bonus if the kids and i can travel up there by car easily and stay there whenever the mood strikes. but i can't sell current home until dec 2024 (youngest turns 18) because the payment is nearly half of the going rate of 1bdrm apartments in the area....so might as well stay and work on paying it off since i can't relocate. it's a bit early to consider buying.... but in ideal world i'd buy future home roughly 2022 and give myself time to do intrusive renovations while i'm not actively living there.&amp;#x200b;tl;dr - single woman with decent savings and low debt can i finance a second home?",3,1,Buying a second home - not even sure feasible?,Finance

9814,"hey all - i'm just very perplexed about how to proceed with this. my wife has gotten periodic calls about a debt that isn't hers.the first call came about twelve years ago. this was shortly after we were married and her name was changed. they had her maiden name, social security number, and an address that her mother had lived in while my wife was in college (but that my wife never used). we really don't believe her mother stole her identity - while that's always a possibility, it's very unlikely given the family situation.the people on the phone made it sound like was a legit debt and we made the mistake of giving them a credit card over the phone to pay it off (something like $100, we figured let's just get this off our record).over the years, she'd periodically get similar calls, always using her maiden name, always listing that as her address. we've ignored them.today she got another round of them. she has the cell phone plan for the whole family in her name, and we all got calls. it's this serious sounding voicemail that says she has pending litigation and that she has a right to contact the plaintiff before a lawsuit is filed.i decided to call and talk to the people. the first guy tried to get info out of me, which i wouldn't give him and he said, ""good luck in court"" and hung up. i called back. the second lady was a little nicer (at first). i explained that if it's a legit debt i'd pay it off today, but that i think it's not correct. she disclosed that it was an online payday loan lender and the debt was taken out  about seven years ago (long after i had paid off that previous debt collector with the same address). this new debt would be many years after my wife changed her name and many years after her mother was no longer living at the address they have on file.this would all be fine, but the thing that confuses me is that the lady didn't seem to try hard at all to get me to pay what they're asking for. she didn't even give me an amount. she said that her client would rather take me to court because they will get more money that way and that she is a ""mediator,"" and that they have to mediate before going to court. she wouldn't provide any documentation about the debt and said i could request it in discovery. she got very rude at the end and ultimately hung up on me. she had told me that the total they will sue me for is around $1500 and the current settlement offer is lower than that (but she didn't say what it was).but none of this makes sense. why didn't she pressure me to take a settlement amount on the phone? are they really going to bother suing over such a relatively small amount of money? $1500 hardly seems worth the trouble.we pulled my wife's credit report and this debt doesn't show up on there. we've purchased two homes since the original loan was supposedly taken out. both times we had to pay off weird things that popped up on the credit report, but this obviously never came up.my bullshit detector is high on this one, but i can't seem to figure out what the scam is, if it is a scam. i would have expected her to pressure me to pay something on the phone, and while she left it hanging as an option, she almost steered me away from it.also, it's worth noting that she didn't ask for our current address when i told her the address she has is an address that my never has never lived at. she said that once filed in court, the court will determine her current address and will serve her there or at her place of employment.can anyone shed any light on what's actually going on? thanks!",13,1,Weird debt collection attempt (maybe stolen identity?),Finance

9966,"i, 27m, believe am in a unique position and looking for some guidance and how i should approach my career, investments, and financial situation moving forward.location: southwest united states (not california; lower cost of living)education: ~50 community college creditsbetween the ages of 23 and 25 i worked for a government contracted construction company in the underground pipeline industry. i started as a laborer and worked my way up to a more specific trade. i also obtained a class a cdl which i still hold today. the job entailed a heavy amount of travel and inconsistent hours (days/nights) as well as long shifts sometimes lasting as long as 20 hours. during the time i worked for the company i saved approximately $23,000 in a 401k.after two years in the company, i grew tired of the traveling. i applied for a position at civil engineering firm in my local city as a construction inspector. i took a pay-cut to $25.00/hr and 40 hours a week with no overtime in 2018 (approximately 50k/yr). i took the job because i enjoyed it; outside all day, paperwork (but not staring at a computer all day), no labor, and easy hours.when the field work gets slow, they have an inspector go to the office and do office work. i’m a bit more computer literate than most other field personnel, so they kept me in the office for an extended period of time. during that time i learned lot – gis experience (esri software) and gradually a lot of civil engineering experience.fast forward a year and a half and am in the office full-time feel i am basically irreplaceable. for instance, the senior gis specialist resigned and one particular gis software extension he learned by taking a week-long course out of state. i learned the software by reading the user manual online and have automated a lot of the previously-manual work of the extension. i am the only individual who can fully operate the program.i train eit’s (engineers-in-training) out of college with engineering degrees. i also completed a couple large projects and have been given new projects. i complete most of the “grunt-work” of the projects. because of that i go to meetings with the city and answer a lot of the curve-ball questions because i am the individual who knows. point being is i am buried with work now - working in an office in front of a screen all day, handling multiple projects for multiple cities, and (after my review recent end of year review) am now paid $28.40/hr from $26.70 last year. this is a decent hourly wage, i know. my gripe is there are construction inspectors (doing the job i applied for) making $30+ who are incapable of doing a good job at their job. i spend a lot of time fixing errors in their paperwork in the office. basically it comes down to “lack-of-experience” aka my age. the thing is, too, is that it is less the $1.60/hr i care about than the principle. here is where the plot thickens…i’ve been working remotely since march due to covid-19. the $23,000 401k i rolled over to an ira and, by the start of the year, it contained $28,000.while working at home i’m missing two hours of rush hour traffic per day so have some more time on my hands. i’ve managed to turn that $28,000 into $163,000 by trading various stocks. and, for the record, i did not get lucky in one single trade. i’ve placed probably 100-200 trades and do not “day-trade” – more so swing-trade. i do not do high risk options; just extensive research and educated purchases.  my net worth as of today is currently $202,535. my debt is $8,600 on a 2016 honda civic with ~30,000 miles plus a credit card which i pay in full every month. on the side i drive for doordash ($20-$25/hr in my area), work for my buddy's moving company which i enjoy ($25/hr), and another friend's pressure washing company (about $20/hr). i also created, this past summer, a niche stock-tracking spreadsheet of which i accept donations and have probably received $1,000-$2,000 worth of donations – it’d be more but i don’t quite have the time to update it as much as i’d like. if i did, i feel i could charge a nominal monthly fee. i also have an llc for a cbd product company and probably a 300-year supply of cbd isolate i purchased from a hemp farm, but haven’t had the time to get off the ground. as the stress builds in my current job and i sit soullessly staring into a computer screen eight hours per day i feel i am capable of making the jump to being self-employed. i can work on my projects, help my friends with their companies, and fill in any gaps with doordash if necessary.i am looking for advice in regards to this thought process.first off, am i crazy for feeling this way?secondly, my big concern is health insurance. is there a way i can obtain health insurance cheaply or maybe a good part time company to work for that would provide it?

it's why i even have the emergency fund i do now, and why i have some investments in the market. but i feel like everything may come crashing down and i don't want to make any stupid moves. i renegotiated my rent so i can stay here through next year and the pandemic's hopeful end (god please!!). i have enough between my parent's social security money + the savings i have to forcefully conjure to keep us living here comfortably for another year. i had to renegotiate my rent at a bit of a higher price. of course, the landlords are taking advantage of everything somehow going up in price while people are suffering, but it was about $1k difference and i didn't think it would be worth having to look for a new place. now i am also running into dental issues and think i'll need to use at least $2k to make sure i can keep my teeth longterm. now i'm eating into my own emergency fund, and i know it's an emergency fund, but it's the only cash i have left of my inheritance, about $10k. i don't even know what i'm asking for. i do not want to end up in poverty. i'm a somewhat intelligent person. i have a college degree. i went through hard times and it has thrown me into a dimension where everything is hard. i have to fight against a parent that acts like a child when it comes to budgeting and spending. i am 31 and i want a life. i want a career and to be married someday, but sometimes i feel like i'm raising my mother, and that i am so, so behind and it's so hard to see that this will all be a memory someday and i will have the life i want. can someone please tell me this isn't that bad and there's a way out? i don't know what i'm looking for!

12417,"hey yinz,need some life finance advice. my father passed away a couple years ago and i inherited a small house. after selling it and with some expenses, i'm sitting with about 70k in the bank leftover and have about another 10k in my emergency/misc account. i currently have about 45k remaining in public student loans and am debating whether i should use this money to buy my first house or pay off my students... or both if possible? honestly, i know very little about finances and even less about buying a home. i was raised pretty poor so have any money is relatively new to me. so to give you some context:i'm 29yo, single (and have no plans for kids), and live in pittsburgh. i earn about 80k per year with a fairly stable federal government job. that will probably gradually rise over the next decade, perhaps making around 100k sometime in the next 5-10 years if i do everything right. right now i'm on an ibr student loan plan (i didn't make much right out of college) and about 4 years of payments into the 10 required to get the public student loan forgiveness. however, that will probably be near a wash as my ibr payments continue to increase and i'll likely be close to paying off the loans after a full 10 years anyway, regardless of the public student loan forgiveness program. i have good credit and no other financial burdens (newer car that's also paid off). i'd like to stay in pittsburgh for a while, perhaps even the length of my career. house prices in the neighborhood i'm looking at are currently in the 200-300 range, with 250 appearing to be the common number for comps to what i desire. with the right house, i'd probably be living there for a long, long time. the market in my desired neighborhood will certainly get hotter and pricier with each year.my initial plan was to immediately pay off my student loans and then save over the next few years for a solid 20% down payment on the house i desire. however, i also feel like the 900/mo i'm paying in rent every month feels like a complete waste. so fellow redditors and finance gurus, i need your advice.   do i...  \- stick to my original plan. pay off student loans now, save for probably 3 years or so and buy the house i desire. and if this, should i put my remaining 20-25k in something like an etf? \-buy a house and keep paying student loans (500/mo now and will probably increase to 700/mo in the next few years by my estimates). \-do both? if i pay off my student loans, i'll have 20-25k for a down payment. obviously that's not 20% for 250k, so i'll certainly be feeling higher payments and probably get smacked with pmi. also, it seems there may be at least 10,000 in loan forgiveness looming with the new admin. does this change any of that?   any help is appreciated. thank you.",7,1,Help!

12991,"my gut says this is an easy question: out of pocket. but i wanted to make sure i'm thinking this through. i'm a k12 teacher and have been accepted into a local phd program (phd in curriculum and instruction). i could go full-time as a student on fellowship and finish in 3-4 years, but the stipend is $18k/year and offers some benefits like health insurance. however, financially, that seems to be out of the question as i can also earn the degree going part time while making $58k/year with excellent benefits and contributions to a defined pension plan. i also should note since it usually gets brought up when referring to teacher retirement: my state has both a defined pension and access to social security. the cost of attendance and estimated final cost for the phd program is $75k. after discussing my plan for completion with my advisor, she estimates that i will finish in 5 years. there is the possibility to switch to a full-time student with funding at any point in my time as a student, but that's not guaranteed as an option. simple math says that this is $15k/year to pay out of pocket. my wife and i combine to make ~$120k/year. we have room in our budget to pay the $15k/year with some sacrifices. however, it would most likely take away from my roth ira contributions, which i've been maxing for five years now. in terms of post-graduation earnings: my school system offers an automatic $8000/year raise for a doctorate. the degree also opens doors to other higher paying positions that are not available to me as a teacher. for example, according to my system's salary schedule, our director of curriculum and instruction makes between $88k and $102k (not sure what year she is). if i were able to land a tenure-track position, the average salary of assistant professors of education (according to public expenditure reports of public colleges) are $65k - $80k from the people i've looked up. what concerns me though is that i will be limiting my retirement investment to pay for school. the earning potential is certainly higher and would guarantee a better pension. however, losing 5 years of compound interest with those contributions makes me question paying out of pocket. not to mention, there will be $750/month we have to make room for. that limits general savings, luxuries, size of vacations, etc.",38,1,Is it better for me (my situation) to pay for a PhD out of pocket or use student loans?,Finance

13185,"a little desperate for someone to point me in the right direction, so here we go.this is a situation my partner is in, although we both feel the impact due to how awful &amp; unethical these practices are. my partner (26m) has been out of college for nearly 3 years now. we both live in georgia and attended the same college, which he spent five years at. unfortunately, his parents (mother and step-father) did very little research, and put very little thought, into the whole student loans thing. they went with sallie mae, the notoriously evil private student loans company, and had his step-father co-sign on the loans. they also never cared to read the fine print that states interest has no limit to which it can increase. i can't help but be a bit mad, but i know not everyone is informed on the student debt crisis. i, however, am very lucky my parents helped research with me so that i could take the federal loan route.i believe my boyfriend has either 8 or 10 loans. the interest rates on all are very high, one being at 13%. the monthly payments end up being half of what he brings home each month -- leaving very little wiggle room considering other costs such as rent, food, etc. after countless attempts, he's come to terms with the fact that sallie mae won't adjust his payments to income-based, they won't give him any options for forbearance, and they generally won't give him any options to alleviate the hardship he faces. he tried refinancing with his bank (student loans are $80k), but was denied. i never understood how miserable this could make a person, and even using the word miserable to describe it's affect is an understatement.currently, he is in delinquent status on his loans. i believe he has three months of missed payments until he goes into 'default' status. we've researched lots on people who default on their loans and end up going into collections. some are able to do a pay-to-delete with the collections agency. ruining his credit wouldn't be the end of the world -- luckily, i'm a homeowner and he lives with me. he doesn't have anything to his name, although he does make car payments. although he has been paying the loans for almost 3 years, they have continued to increase. it seems like it will never end.the issue here is the whole co-signer thing. if he went into default, they would come after his step-dad. i've been trying to research relevant laws in georgia, but have had little luck finding anything..my primary question is this: what options are available? 1. loan consolidation? i doubt sallie mae would allow him to take this route because of his payment status2. refinancing? several lenders have denied him (annual income w/o taxes is $55k, student loan principal cost + interest is probably $85k, and his credit score is below a 650 due to delinquent payments.) i've even tried seeing if a lender will refinance his biggest loan of $20k with no luck3. filing for bankruptcy? i noticed that if you were to file for chapter 13 bankruptcy in ga, there are more protections for the co-signer. i know this isn't ideal.thanks in advance!",7,1,"Private student loan options w/ cosigner - default, bankruptcy, etc.",Finance

13957,"hello all!i am having some difficulty deciding between two job offers i have received within the past week. i currently work as a gov't employee in a dead end job. i worked 5 years prior in the private industry out of college in mep consulting, the company started to dry out so i decided to take a stable gov't job in a completely new field while i hunted for my next career. i have just about maxed out my current pay scale (gs-11 / step 9) \~92k, and started hunting for a career last february.offer 1: amazon (operations engineer)i was contacted for a position as an operations engineer overseeing new warehouse deployments at amazon, they offered me a compensation package as follows:base salary: 72,000year 1 bonus: 26kyear 2 bonus: 21krestricted stock units: 20 (currently worth \~66k)**year 1 estimated total comp: \~$101k**amazon vesting schedule: 5%/15%/40%/40%the big potential issue with the job is that it is advertised as travel intensive (\~80%), i recently got engaged last october and am worried that i will be called away very frequently for this position to the point of ruining my life. in the interview process the team mentioned they try to alternate the travel to be fair to the whole team. i will say that while the interview process with amazon was long and grueling, everyone i interviewed with were some of the brightest and smartest people i have ever met. i have wanted to work for a big company like this for a long time, a dream of mine since college. i have been applying to faang companies for years and this is the first time i have had a bite, let alone an actual offer. amazon also told me i would be able to work wherever i wanted and could be remote full time.offer 2: local gov't contractori had been waiting to hear from amazon for many months after interviewing with no offer. a recruiter messaged me on linkedin for a position near me for a role that would be similar to the industry i worked in for 5 years out of college. i had intended to leave that industry to seek something new, the mep industry can be stressful and very boring at times. this new role would be more of a project management type role where i would be overseeing aspects of the construction industry and located at a government facility for 3 years as part of the contract they plan to place me on.**the pay for this position i negotiated to is \~105k**there are a couple of notable things about this position, the company currently only has 11 people and has only been around for 4 years. they say my offer isn't contingent on them landing a government contract which they promise should be finalized within the next week, but the recruiting firm also recommended that i not give my two weeks until it is finalized.the next interesting item about this role is the position promises to pay (up-to 50%) of your salary as a bonus on project close-out, the ceo mentioned this is to incentivize people sticking through to see a job fully completed. i realize this can make the salary really spike up on job completions..my fear is the nature of a business as small as this, who is to say that there would even a next job. the ceo said he expects to have 20 people working for him by the end of the year, that is almost double the current size of the company! the company has 2 locations, one in dc, one in south carolina. i see the appeal of being on the ground floor of a business like this, but i fear there are some serious risks with a company this small and young. i also fear i will just be a butt in a seat to be forgotten in the middle of a gov't facility attached to a contract. the ceo stated he could see me around 120k when i get my pe, i have already taken it once (almost passed it) and i expect to get it within the next year.the job pays healthcare premiums, offers 4% match, and will give the week off between christmas and new years as pto.bottom line:job 1 @ amazon: year 1 pay (\~101k), 20 units of stock (\~66k current value) that will grow and vest over 4 years, travel heavy (80%)job 2 @ gov't contractor: year 1 pay (\~105k), paid health insurance, opportunity for 50% bonus based on salary for project completions (i will assume 3 yrs min to complete a project), located locally.i feel like both jobs present a great opportunity, there is just a really large appeal getting incorporated into a company like amazon. i hear it is a lot of hard work but there is some real growth potential and money to be made. the second job will pay a more stable income yearly that isn't dependent on stock, i am worried about working for such a small company that hasn't been around for a while and might have bitten out more than they can chew (hiring prematurely to contract award/doubling size within a year)any insight or help anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated as i make this decision. i thank you all for your time.",0,1,Advice on competing job offers (Amazon vs. Gov't Contractor),Finance

15505,"so i am 23 years old. i am going into my last year of school starting this spring, for my finance degree. the only other job i have worked is a remote telemarketing job, that pays 10 an hour with some small commissions for each sale. i have been searching through indeed applying for countless other remote jobs, to see if i can find something better/more interesting.  well i currently have just been offered a job, after a couple phone interviews with 2 business partners in the real estate wholesale business. the job i would be working is commission only. i would be calling people from my home, and asking them if they want to sell their home. if they say yes, i would be peeling back the onion a bit more, asking them about the condition and things like that. after i get enough information from them, i would then transfer the to a higher up, to set an appointment to go look at the property.  so basically my job is to set as many appointments as i can, so that i can increase my chances on the company buying the house from them. the company would then sell the property for a gain, and then 14-30 days after the company sells the property, is when i would get my commission for it. the man had told me that the average money i would receive from commission would be around $1,000 a house, sometimes more so of like $2,000 if it is a big property.  basically, i would not be receiving any money for the first month most likely, because he says i need to build a ""pipeline"" which i guess makes sense. he had told me that this is not the job for someone who cannot handle rejection and make a lot of calls per day. this is also a 1099 job, but he wants me to set up a schedule where i can put in at least 20 hours per week.   i had also asked him how many others were working my position, and he told me i would be the 3rd person, as they recently hired the first two very recently. he had told me that only 1 person was making the calls pre-covid, and that he was very motivated and calling tons of ppl per week, but then covid happened and they shut down the wholesale side of the business for a few months. they are just recently getting back to starting up their wholesale side again, hence why i found their application on indeed.  thing is, is that i actually have a phone interview this friday, for an inside sales job that pays $11.80 an hour, its not a 1099 so id be an ""employee"". do i tell him that i need more time, and that ill get back to him at the end of the week?&amp;#x200b;is this something worth risking? does it sound like it could be a good opportunity? i like to think it is possibly a good opportunity, but it comes with the risk of not getting paid and then me eventually quitting and wasting weeks/ a month or so of my time. then again, i am a college student living at home, where my father makes me pay pretty much nothing to live here, besides my phone bill. so realistically i have time to be wasted (not that i want to, but its not like i'm struggling to pay bills living alone). it seems like i could potentially make a good amount more at this job than the $11,80 an hour one, but i also could potentially make way less or nothing, and waste my time. the guy had told me that if i put in at least 20 hours a week and i am doing a decent job, that i could make around $40k a year doing something like this, but is that just him sugarcoating it? i have no idea.   i had also asked him if ppl were really willing to sell their homes during this pandemic, and he said that it seems like ppl are just as willing to sell, and that he plans on 2021 being a big year for ppl to sell their homes. i do not have a lot of knowledge about real estate, but it has been something  that i have been interested in, even before this job came along.",13,1,Commission only job.

should i feel bad for 87 other people, because i demanded a raise, and their livelihoods are on the line because a pay raise would result in a possible epidemic?they are in another precarious december again, i took pto for our scheduled 'furlough' the day they cancelled it. i had to suffer 9 months of filing unemployment, requesting pto or losing out on furloughs and hours i couldn't make up. my 'loyalty' was stretched thin before the insurance change, even worse as they fumbled their way thru the pandemic.so my question is, we're stretched thin, we pay a lot to live where we are at, is it the right time to ask for a raise, while the company is in a slump. my 401k is almost dry, that's how i got to being totally debt free, but i have 2 kids, one a special needs who is 21 years old and a daughter about to graduate who i want to send to college.first things first is to move to a cheaper location, i fuel up once a month due to proximity, we spend excess in groceries right now because we can afford it, and i have about $12,500 in savings, i did help my mother with close to $18k for medical bills.community college, and i'll help with student loans there and after.my finances are are ok, and i can afford 3-4 months without a job, but i'll never get to that level and build what i have built, so i want to keep moving, i don't want another pathway, and it's not about a promotion, it's about equal pay that put off because of the insurance.i set my bar low, $25 an hour and i couldn't even reach that in 7 years, but without me they wouldn't get the money they are looking forward to for 2020. so no leverage there unless i move forward on to operation overload, but history tells me it wouldn't matter one bit, and i squandered any two weeks notice that would have had impact but i don't shit like that.but i don't know, that's why i'm here for any advice, suggestions and if this out of order and breaking any rules please delete and i'll find somewhere else, because im lost and want to be prepared this time, thanks to everyone reading and i'm sorry for the disorder, but if more information is needed i'll provide what i can honestly and truthfully. thanks.",9,1,"Asking for raise, due to benefit changes and matching fair market value.",Finance

17520,"tldr: mlm essential oil mom hooked financially illiterate me up with a primerica rep that i didn't know was a high-fee mlm company as well and i invested into both an intermediate account(2 class a mutual funds) and a roth ira(1 class a mutual fund) with her. it seems my investments are currently up and i'd like to get out and roll-over my roth ira to fidelity or other if that would be smart so i'm seeking a little advice and clarification(questions listed at the end).from the title i think everyone can already tell where i'm going with this unfortunately. my mom sells doterra essential oils and i have been outspoken against it for years especially as a college student now studying molecular/cellular biology. i will say that my mom has helped me to be smart with money growing up, but because of our rocky relationship i have also tried my best to be independent of her which included saving my money often and working various jobs since turning 16. a couple years ago, she met someone who was a primerica rep in one of her ""networking"" circles and urged me to meet with her and invest as well as open up a retirement account. i was very financially iliterate in much of those areas and my mom knew that and i said i would consider talking to the rep but i didn't want to commit to anything or even set up a meeting with her yet...my mom gave her my contact info and next thing i knew the rep was texting me and we had a meeting set up the next week at a random starbucks. the woman seemed nice and knowledgeable, i had no idea primerica was an mlm, and i trusted my mom(at least with money-related things) and so i invested into two mutual funds within an intermediate account(sblgx and shmmx both class a) and a roth ira with one mutual fund(shapx class a). only in the past year have i found that to be a mistake and learn about primerica's high fees, mlm business model, and more. it seems i am currently up in my investments and slightly in my roth ira, but i would like to get out as soon as i can and as soon as its smart to (hopefully now since my account is up). i would like to take out my investments and roll over my roth ira to somewhere better like fidelity. i have not talked to my rep in forever and she does not know of my plans to leave yet and it seems that she won't be pushy if i try to but i can only hope. so my questions are:1. does this sound like a good plan and fidelity a good option? i've since become more financially literate and continue trying my best to learn more every day and so i don't want/need to pay large custodial fees for someone to ""manage"" my account(s).2. i've gotten conflicting answers on termination fees for rolling over a roth ira from primerica to another company like fidelity, but should i start this process with the company i'm rolling it over to first as i've heard primerica might be reluctant to help me leave?3. should i do this all before january to avoid any 2021 annual fees(like the custodial fee) from primerica?4. (might be a dumb or highly subjective question): once i roll my roth ira over, it seems best to invest in a reccomended and well-researched ntf, but do you reccomend investing in etf(s) as well/instead?i've tried to do the best i could researching a lot of this, but i just need a little help with the if and how i take the next steps (setting up an account with/calling fidelity?). i'm 21 now and so i don't care if my mom is against me leaving primerica(she is, i've brought up the possibility before), but she doesn't know i'm actually wanting to do it now and would not want to help me with any of it nor would she likely understand even if she did want to help me undo this. despite hating mlm's with a passion, they still found a way to prey on me and so i hope i can only help others not make the same mistakes in the future. thank you all and i apologize for the long post!",20,1,"Mom sells Doterra, has a friend who is a Primerica rep, and I was 19(now 21) with some hard-earned money and no investment or Roth IRA knowledge at the time which they both knew...",Finance

17572,"hi all. was sent here from r/investing with a question. seeking advice from anyone who has dealt with and / or knows about whole life policies as a form of long term wealth management and growth. the basics of my situation: (age 28) i currently trade in my roth ira account with schwab, have a decent amount of crypto stored up that i bought back in early 2017, i'm getting into real estate (purchasing my first rental property this year), and i also dabble in daytrading with an etrade account (stocks and selling options contracts). above and beyond my current investment allocation (i work as a private contractor, so it depends on ""what type of year"" i'm having) i have about $300 / month to spare in investing at this time, above and beyond my current diversification strategy. a few years back, my dad got me looking into something called an irc 7702(j), which is an irs code for a whole life policy type, that allows for 1/3 premium payments towards death benefit and a 2/3 ""paid up additions"" that earn interest and dividends in the account, and can be used as collateral to borrow against the policy, getting lent money from the insurance company via a line of credit they take out. i started my first policy about 6 months ago, opting for the $900 plan, meaning i pay $300 towards premium with $600 towards paid up additions each month. however, with covid and contract work in my relevant industry being sketchy, i am only able to just pay the premium each month and $10 towards the paid up additions (the minimum required to keep the policy going). when i reached out about possibly canceling the policy, i received a lengthy, sales-pitchey email from my agent explaining i can cancel anytime, but i must be ""misunderstanding how my policy works for me"". i'll post the contents of that email below, but basically i wanted to know what the general consensus would be on me being able to better utilize that $300 / month extra cash flow. since i am only able to just barely pay the premium and only $10 of the actual paid up additions, would it make sense to find better use for maximizing that $300 / month, or am i jumping the gun wanting to surrender the policy so soon? thanks in advance! here are the contents of the sales pitch response: *your overfunded, maximized whole life policy isn’t an ordinary ”investment”.  it is a financial tool.  a multi-faceted financial account, that we call the “wealth maximization account” (wma), and it does the following:**it provides a tax-free death benefit to your heirs.**the death benefit funds will bypass probate.  the policy acts as its own will and trust with a direct designated beneficiary.  so, there’s no additional court costs, time delays, or attorney’s fees.**it provides tax-free cash to you, while you’re alive, in the event of a terminal illness.**it can provide tax-free dollars that you can use to cover medical expenses, long-term care, college education costs for your kids, or retirement income funds for you and your wife.  it can do all of that without cashing out the account, or limiting future growth.  how?  you’re not using your money!  instead, the insurance company allows you to use their money (fully collateralized by your cash values that are still compounding in your account).**it provides guaranteed interest, plus non-guaranteed dividends that can grow tax-free.  those dividends provide inflation protection.  dividends generally rise with interest rates.  furthermore, there’s no stock market risk involved.  so your funds are safe and protected.**it is private.  nothing is reported publicly, and nothing is reported on your state or federal tax return.  you’ll never get a 1099 interest statement.**a portion of the cash values are protected by state law from your creditors, so there’s a layer of liability protection.**if the insurance company becomes insolvent, you have several layers of protection.  first, as a policyholder of a mutual company, you are an owner of the company and are entitled to your share of their assets, unlike a stock company.  second, there’s a huge pool of stable and highly profitable insurance companies all around them that would be chomping at the bit to gain the policyholders of the insolvent company and would likely buy them out before a bankruptcy would ever happen (much like what happened when massmutual purchased met life a few years ago).  third, each state has an insurance guaranty association that collects funds from each insurance company that does business in that state each year and holds those funds reserve to make the policyholders that live in that state whole if a default were ever to happen.**you can keep your money in the cash value of your account, while simultaneously using the insurance company’s money to invest in other areas.  so, while your funds have been in the account over those 15 years, you’ve been able to use those funds to invest in other areas at the same time.  for example, you could take out a policy loan, using the insurance company’s money, to purchase facebook stock.  so, you don’t have to decide which one is better (the life insurance or facebook).  you don’t have to sacrifice one to get the other.  you can do both at the same time!  funnel your cash through the life insurance policy and then use the insurance company’s money to invest in stock, or a business, or cryptocurrency, or whatever you want.**you control all transactions from start to finish.  you decide if, how, or when to take policy loans, make additional payments, or loan repayments.  it’s totally up to you.  there’s no loan repayment requirement.  you basically act as your own personal bank.  you still get to use that $7.64 million of cash as you see fit, even while the policy is providing you and your family with all of the benefits i just listed.  you’re enabling a dollar to work more effectively, without losing access or control of the dollar.  you’re creating additional gains at the same time on the same dollar.  in the stock world, we call that arbitrage!*",7,1,Whole Life Policy [ IRC 7702(j) ] Question // Maximizing My Extra Cashflow,Finance

18315,"very long post, short version is at the bottomfor the past 6 years, i have been living paycheck to paycheck, making just barely enough money to cover my bills, and i honestly haven't had enough money to shop for groceries in years. i have always had to go to a family member's house for dinner, or my roommates have had to pay for food. what i am asking for is advice on how to get ahead and pay off my debt so that i can actually have some quality of life for the first time since i started working at 18 years old (i'm 28 currently). for background, here is how i got into my situation:at 18 years old, i shipped out to basic training in the air force, which i had wanted to do since i was 7-8 years old. 4 weeks into training, i was sent home on a medical discharge on a condition i wasn't aware that i had, so i went home to live with my dad and began working at taco bell until i could begin college. i started college for mechanical engineering, and quit my job at taco bell and started working at pizza hut because it was much closer to my school. i was quickly promoted to a shift manager at pizza hut, and really enjoyed the job, and shortly after being promoted they made me full time, so i could actually pay my bills and afford to drive to school. i wasn't happy with the major i was in, and changed majors a total of 2 times. i still didn't think i would happy with a career in the major i was in, so i finished my semester and did not go back, and continued to work full time as a manager at pizza hut.still enjoying my job, i was offered to train to be a general manage, and was thrilled. i loved my job, and was going to get paid a livable wage to do it. after a year and a half of training, i was still not offered my own store, so i was being paid $11 an hour to do a general manager's job, was constantly called on my days off to help talk the manager through problems, and basically had no time for a life, the job just kept getting worse. so, i started working at a bank as a teller, and within one month i was promoted to a full time desk job at $13 an hour. i continued to work full time at both jobs for 3 months to pay off my car, and 3 days after i paid off the car the engine went, and i had to buy a new one. i spent a few hundred on a car from a relative, and a few weeks later, that one died on me as well. after that, i purchased my first car from a dealer, and went down to only working at the bank. i loved the bank, and was hoping to be promoted there, but it was a small local bank with only 4 branches, and all of the employees had been there for 20+ years, so i had many years to wait before i would be able to advance.i decided then to go to school for electrical lineman, which was in texas, so i quit the bank, and took out a $20,000 loan from sallie mae (my first big mistake). a few weeks before graduating, i was having bad back pain, so i got an x-ray. i have two discs in my lower back disintegrating, bone spurs on multiple vertebra, and arthritis. the doctor told me a career as a lineman was not going to work for me. also during school, i tried to trade in my car for a cheaper one, and the salesman asked for my keys and license. after showing me a few cars that would cost more every month, i said i wanted to leave. 3 more salesman talked to me, and wouldn't give me back my keys so i could leave. after being there for 8 hours, i told them the only way i'm leaving with a car is if its cheaper than my current payment, and they take my car for trade (they wanted me to leave it on the side of the road to be repossessed). they finally agreed, and after i signed the loan paperwork, i saw that they increased the loan amount by $4,000 without telling me, i'm assuming because they were mad that i was there for so long (this was my second large mistake).i moved back home, and started back at pizza hut, and started and finished an online degree in healthcare administration. i looked for jobs in that field, but everywhere wanted a bachelor's degree, and every job i could have taken paid less than my $14 an hour pizza hut job. so, i started school again, for radiologic technology, and loved it. i finished one year, and during my summer clinicals, i couldn't work enough while doing clinical to pay my bills, and i was at risk of having my car repossessed. so, i dropped out of school with the intention of getting caught up on bills and continuing the year after. pizza hut couldn't get me ahead, i was just barely making it paycheck to paycheck, and then i had to start making payments on my $50,000 worth of student loans, so i was screwed. my dad finished his respiratory therapy degree and got a job in virginia, and rented a house. a few months later he bought a house and offered my girlfriend and i to take over his lease, as there were a lot more jobs around and it was a chance for me to start over and get a good job going. then, covid. now, i live in a house with my girlfriend and between the rent and utilities, my stupid car payment, and student loans and credit card, i cannot make enough money to pay my bills. i work at walmart full time on overnights stocking shelves for $11 an hour, and have a per diem job at a hospital as a patient registrar which pays $15 an hour, but they are only guaranteeing me 25 hours per month. i don't know what to do to get myself out of this mess. i did some quick math, and if i stay at walmart and the hospital, it will take me over 15 years to pay all my debt. i can't live this way for 15 years, i can't do anything with my girlfriend like dates, i can't afford food so she pays for that, and i can't even contribute to utilities. it will be months before i even catch up on my late bills, and i recently got a call saying the bank i got my car loan through is close to repossessing my car. i can't think of a way to get out of this hole, and i need help. please, any advice i can get will be helpful. i know about the strategies to pay off debt like the snowball method, the problem is i can't find a job that will let me break even every month, let alone make extra payments on debt. i tried to talk to attorneys about bankruptcy, but they said it wouldn't help me because it would only get rid of my credit card debt which is $3000, and it would cost $1500 just to file. i could get rid of the car debt that way, but then i wouldn't have a way to get to work and i can't afford to buy another car. i tried debt consolidation loans, but everywhere says that my debt is too high and my income is too low. the short version:debt: $400 car payment, $80 car insurance, $80 cell phone, $120 credit card, $400 sallie mae, $200 federal student loans, about $130 a month for gas, $500 for my half of rent, $200ish for utilities. so, a little over $2000 a month total. my income from walmart is about $1300 a month after taxes, and my job at the hospital will only bring me about $400 a month guaranteed.i've made a few bad financial mistakes and now i feel that my life is ruined. i am horribly depressed, and it's affecting my relationship, and if my girlfriend and i split i will be left to pay all the bills, which i

18337,"pre-apologize for the long post, just trying to plan our future here! i'm looking for some advice/suggestions so that we are make the right choices with our money. we both only have a basic understanding of finance and retirement savings choices and that makes us a little nervous about some of these big decisions.student loans are paid off! my wife and i pursued an aggressive payment schedule (\~2k/mo) to pay off our student loans and, now that we have achieved our goal, we agreed the money would not influx into our normal budget but rather all go into retirement savings.with the 2k/mo student loan payment gone, we figure that's another 24k/yr after-tax or 30k/yr of pre-tax income (assuming 25% tax) to invest. our only other active investments have been our minimum-to-receive-the-match 401k contributions and 315/mo to a roth ira we started recently. we will continue the 410k contributions, but are not committed to the roth - so i will throw the roth into the total we are looking to optimize our investment strategy on. trying to speak the same language on all this, if i think of the roth that in pre-tax dollars (again assuming 25% tax) that's about 4700. rounding it all to a nice whole number, let's say we have a total of 35k/yr in additional pre-tax dollars we are looking to invest in the best way possible.here's some background on our situation and goals with my questions at the end.**stats:*** age: both 29* pre-tax salary income: 128k1. 78k salary and yearly raises \~4% (yearly bonus of about 10%, but we would prefer to keep this as fun money)2. 50k salary and yearly raises \~2%* current monthly expenses: \~5k (including 2k/mo that was toward loans). we are fairly comfortable with our monthly budget and have calculated our ""oh shit we both lost our jobs"" monthly budget to be about 2k* debts: mortgage at &lt;3%, no pmi and no intention to pay ahead of loan* emergency fund: \~12k, we add 500/mo from our monthly budget* current investments:1. 401k: 8% of 78k salary (6240) to receive 4% company match. company uses vanguard and the current balance of \~45k is invested in vffvx2. 401k: 5% of 50k salary (2500) to receive 5% company match. company uses t rowe price and the current balance of \~5k is invested in trrnx3. 403b: \~13k sitting in old 403b account, expense ratio sucks need to roll it into a new account4. ira: \~3500 in a roth ira account, been adding 315/mo**money goals:*** retire early, but no clear number in mind - maybe 55?* raise a family (2-3 kids), including paying for their college (we cannot put our children through what we went through - no 17 year old can be reasonably expected to understand the burden they are agreeing to)**questions/discussion:*** the first investment that seemed to make the most sense to us, was to just start maxing out our 401ks. for the 78k salary, that would be bumping from 8% (6240) to 25% (19500), which would add 13,260 in pre-tax dollars. for the 50k salary that would be bumping from 5% (2500) to 39% (19500), which would add 17k in pre-tax dollars. this would eat 30,260 of the additional 35k pre-tax we have to invest. is this the best strategy? i certainly like how easy this would be to manage, but the t row price expense ratios seems high.* next we were considering maxing out an hsa. we each have our own health plan, but only 1 has an hsa. that would be another 3500 pre-tax from the total. i really don't know anything about this investment strategy other than people say it's a good approach. i suppose i might be afraid this would get eaten away by medical expenses and not really be a retirement savings account.* if the two items above are the best approach, that would only leave 1240 for further investments. but we also plan to keep our budget stable and continue to add raises to our retirement savings, so this piece is also sort of where do we go next. the clear answer seems to be maxing and ira for the both of us, but i cannot get a hold on whether the roth or traditional is the best option. i've read the resources on this site and it seems from a pure dollars standpoint traditional should be worth more cash in hand in retirement, but it also sound like it's more or a limitation if we retired early. how would we pay for any years prior to 59 1/2? this is the topic i feel the most confused on, so really appreciate any feedback.",5,1,Student Loans Paid Off - Advice Transitioning to Retirement Savings,Finance

19416,"i am an 18m college student. i got a credit card in september, because i wanted to be able to build a credit score. it is 0% apr until april. i had signed my mom up as an authorized user because i thought it might help my credit increase faster, because her score is over 800. recently, i had a business idea that involves some decently sized purchases(several hundred dollars), and my limit is $1000. &amp;#x200b;so, i made the purchases and ended up with a balance last month of \~700 dollars. i didn't particularly care, since being 18 i have a credit history that is about 2 months long, so the point loss would bounce back quickly once i started having 0 balance. the problem is that i didn't realize it would also adversely affect my mom. she just told me that her score dropped by 30 points (which i think is crazy since she is 60 and has had essentially perfect credit for \~40 years) due to my card being overutilized. is there anything i can do about this? she has never once used the card they sent for her. is there any way she can get those points refunded? i am moderately freaking out. &amp;#x200b;thanks.",15,1,Mom's credit score dropped because of my credit card.,Finance
19417,"tldr:  trying to figure out if its best to pay for a $40k+ garage, as we are trying to avoid having to have our home appraised for a heloc or loan.  we have $15k saved for it.we're looking to have a 40k garage built asap.  we have about 15k dedicated to it right now, but could pull 40k together to pay for it in full if we really needed to (and then repay the accounts we borrowed it from over the next 2 yeasr).  the reason we are wracking our brain on how to pay for it in full, is that we don't want to have our home appraised for a heloc or loan.  there are a few reasons for that:1. our house is in a constant state of construction, partly because my husband is burned out but refuses to hire contractors, and partly because we are living in a house with way too much stuff  (sports equipment, tools, renovation crap, hobbies, etc).  it's a wreck and we don't really want to give anyone a tour, much less have them value our home based on it as it stands today.2. we think our house is actually undervalued on the state assessment, and are worried having the house appraised higher and raising our property taxes.3. my hubsand's whack and just doesn't want anyone in our house.  we aren't hoarders, but sometimes it feels like it as i'm overwhelmed by what work the house needs, and the massive amount of stuff we have occupying the first floor.  a garage would be a godsend and make finishing the renovations so much easier.  i am able to do most of the internal finishing work myself if everything wasn't in the house.  it's overwhelming for me, as i work long hours for my job, and i spend nearly every waking hour cleaning and trying to work around the house.  my husband is burnt out and just refuses to work around the house.  i love him to death, and we joke that he's just lazy...but... he's lazy!  he's been ""renovating"" from the beams up, for 16 years.  we've been married for 5 and i've spent almost every weekend and vacation day working on the house.  he doesn't help much around the house and getting him to work on a house project is usually grounds for an argument, or a let down.  this is all probably irrelevant and tmi, but i'm sure there will be comments about ""just finish the house,"" which believe me, would add years back onto my life.so we are hoping to either pay for the garage in cash, or somehow get a reasonable loan rate w/o getting an appraisal.  we owe about $35k on our house (15 year loan, we always paid extra... at the bottom end of the amortization table at this point).   a quick call to our preferred bank, and they insist we would need an appraisal.  actually, looking at the local property site, i think our house might be appraised at half, if not 1/3rd of its current value... $100k.  so we would be looking to borrow about 45% of our equity.  our combined income is around $130k net, or $200k gross.  what would you suggest?  i don't see much point in paying the house off early, if the bank is going to require us to get an appraisal no matter how much equity we have available.  i've thought about getting a 0% interest credit card for a large portion of it.  if we only relied on the $15k saved, and did not pay off the house, we can afford to pay $2k - $2.5k per month, in order to pay it off before incurring interest... so i figure at that rate we would be paying it off in 14-18 months, but we'd really be tightening our belts to do so (we will have 2 kids in college at that point).any thoughts, input, guidance, condolences, etc are appreciated.  sorry for the long winded explanation.",15,1,Pay off House or Pay for Garage?

20928,"i'm not completely sure this post belongs here, but this *feels* like the right sub for it. i want to write about my most prized possession: my logitech 5.1 surround sound system.i bought these speakers in 2008, when i was just about to start my second year of university. i'd long been annoyed by the quality of sound that desktop computer speakers provided, and laptop speakers were nothing short of a joke. that said, i was a college student who wasn't exactly rolling in disposable income. i'd worked all through high school and could never justify spending the money on speakers; i'd tried buying a pair of cheap, $25 speakers, and i was woefully disappointed.by 2008, i was moving into an off-campus house, where i was going to have a decent room. with how much time i spent reading, researching, and writing as an aspiring political science major, i thought i could justify the expense. that said, i had a *lot* of other priorities. my parents' deal with me was that they would pay tuition and rent, while i'd pay for the rest - i was fortunate enough to grow up in a family that could afford to send me to school and graduate with minimal student loans, and i don't for a second pretend that i am in any way ""self-made"".""the rest"" turns out to be quite expensive - food, books, clothing, and other incidentals all add up, and i'd had no luck finding work during the school year, as the jobs around either would've required me to rearrange required coursework or were work-study jobs that i couldn't get. my money for the year was earned over the summer, when i waited tables. i did some math and figured that i could afford it, so i went to find speakers. i did extensive research and eventually settled on the set that sounded decent, could attach to the headphone input of my laptop, and cost a reasonable amount (\~$150), and i took the plunge.at the time, i'd never spent more on any luxury in my life (books are a whole other story!). i got them, and i took *meticulous* care of them. they would be dusted every week, placed in strategic places, and treated generally well. when i moved (which was twice a year because college), i took great pains to wrap the cords and box them up such that they would not be damaged in transit. my university was an expensive, private school, with many people who had never needed to consider finances in their lives. for them, if something broke, they'd just get a new one, and they behaved accordingly (i don't begrudge them this, but it was a point of contrast in approach that i find notable). by my senior year, friends literally could not believe that my bedroom speakers were from *before sophomore year*.as i sit, 12.5 years after spending $150 on a set of 5 speakers and a subwoofer, i am listening to music - on those very same speakers - in the home office that i own. i am married with two children; i was recently promoted and earn decent money now. i've spent more on things (bought a house, bought a car, engagement ring for my wife, wedding rings for ourselves, countless kitchen gadgets and fun home stuff)and yet, it dawned on me today that these speakers are my most prized possession. it seems so silly, but they truly remind me of being a 19-year-old kid who agonized over spending $150 on something i didn't absolutely need. the care i took of these speakers means that they still function as well as the day i bought them - aside from their shape, distinctly late-2000s, and the logitech logo, which is at least two rebrandings ago, you'd really have no idea that these speakers weren't brand new.i wonder whether i'm the only one who has a seemingly small (and silly) thing that has, over time, become a truly ""prized"" possession.",0,0,My most prized possession,Finance

21029,"so, growing up with parents who did everything wrong financially (no retirement savings, no knowledge of how finances even work, always late on bills and this always paying late fees, highest loan rates, and spending all or more than they make to live for the day), it took me until i was in my 20s before i really started to get it. i am now 46, and i have a large ira and 401k (i have a tiny roth because there was only 1 year when i was below the limit and could contribute).my oldest is in college, my second is starting this fall, and youngest is 14 in hs.i have no 529s, since i always maxed out my own retirement and savings and while they were younger i had no extra for a 529. i am helping them with college (they will borrow some, i will pay some, and they are encouraged to pick schools with merit awards to reduce what they need to borrow over what i will pay).but i would love to get them compounding investment accounts early in life that can come in handy later. for two reasons: 1: so they don't have to go the route i went, which was absolutely broke and desperate until my late 20s, dealing with college loans, no help from anywhere, having to pay my own rent (no living at home with my parents after college bonus), and having kids in my 20s to make matters worse. reason 2: learning about finances, investing, compounding young, and the benefits of starting early - at an age when most people in the country cannot fathom how important starting young is.one route is opening a roth ira, but the challenge here is that they don't really have earned income. the pandemic has thrown a wrench into things, and my wife and i shut them down from working. the jobs we see for teens are without a doubt the highest risk jobs there are, so we have not allowed them to work. we may open that door again this summer, hopefully things have gotten much better everywhere. once they are working, i would look to offer to match their contributions, so if they earned $2000 one summer working and put $1000 in, i would give them $1000 as a gift and they could use that to ""match"" and max out their income to roth.without the earned income, they can't really put money in a roth. one idea i have toyed with is using my own llc to pay them actual income, and have them do stuff for it to earn it. helping grandparents, babysitting, whatever ... legit work items. are there any legal concerns with paying your own kids through an llc so they can contribute?outside of the roth, any other suggestions? i guess we can open straight up investment accounts (no tax breaks) where they would have to annually pay any capital gains on realized gains?whatever we do, they will have skin in the game. either sweat equity, or a matching scheme. i don't believe in trust fund baby stuff, but i do think helping them is good. one great thing my dad did for me when i was a teen, his one good financial insight move as a parent, was when i was in my teens he said he would match whatever i saved for my first car. i was able to save $1500 (1980s) and he helped me get a $3000 used car. i really felt like i worked for that car, and treated it with much care as a result.thanks for advice.",5,1,Investment Account Ideas for Kids,Finance

21799,"how does the deduction change for federal borrowers this year?more that 35 million federal student loan borrowers have been in an interest-free forbearance period since mid-march. the value of the student loan interest deduction this year will be a lot smaller for most of those borrowers.instead of claiming the total interest paid over a 12-month period, most borrowers have only paid interest for january, february and the beginning of march, before the cares act set interest rates to 0%.there are still plenty of people who can claim the full interest deduction this year. there are millions of borrowers with private student loans who weren’t granted any relief on their interest rates this year, though some may have gotten temporary hardship forbearances from their lenders.there are also millions of borrowers with older federal loans that did not qualify for the relief in the cares act. that includes borrowers in the federal family education loan (ffel) program, through which the government backed loans that are actually owned by commercial lenders, and those with perkins loans, some of which are owned by colleges.there are also income cutoffs to qualify for the maximum value of the deduction. if you’re a single filer, you need a modified adjusted gross income of $70,000 or less. if you’re married and filing jointly, the cutoff is $140,000. borrowers earning up to $85,000 (single) or $170,000 (married) can qualify for a partial deduction. (those income limits are based on the irs’s most recent guidelines, but the agency hasn’t released a 2020 update yet.)loans that count toward the deduction include any loan used to pay for an eligible student (you, a spouse or a dependent) for qualified education expenses, such as tuition, fees, books, supplies, and room and board, at an eligible institution.finally, there are a few other stipulations to be able to claim this deduction, including that your filing status isn’t married filing separately and that you can’t be claimed as a dependent on another person’s taxes. you also can’t claim the deduction for payments you made on someone else’s behalf (like a parent helping a child pay off debt).since this is a deduction as opposed to a tax credit (which reduces your tax bill dollar-for-dollar) it takes a little math to figure out how much the deduction is actually worth.the maximum benefit from the student loan interest deduction is $550 this year, but the average amount — even in a typical year — is smaller. the average deduction is about $1,000 according to irs data, which suggests that the average benefit is around $200, says mark kantrowitz, publisher of savingforcollege.com.the value of the deduction depends both on how much a borrower earns and how much interest they’re paying on their loans. say a borrower has the average student loan balance of about $37,500 at 5% interest and is on a 10-year repayment plan. they’ll pay more than $10,250 in interest alone if they make only the minimum payments for the full repayment period.that breaks down to roughly $1,800 in interest they could deduct in their first years of repayment. (as you continue reducing your principal, the amount of interest paid also declines.) if you earned $50,000 and paid $1,800 in interest, the deduction would save you $396.of course, there are millions of borrowers who have six-figure student debt balances, and plenty who have interest rates well above 5%. private student loans often carry rates that are double that. borrowers with large balances or high interest rates can more easily hit the $2,500 maximum deduction.",20,1,You Can Deduct Student Loan Interest on Your 2020 Taxes Even if You Skipped Payments Last Year,Finance

22826,"first off, this may be obvious to a lot of people, but i feel like many people are not aware of it, so i thought it was worth writing about anyway. if you are paying federal loans in the united states on an income-driven repayment plan like paye, repaye, or ibr, your monthly student loan payment is based on your adjusted gross income (agi) then subtracted by 150% of your state's poverty level. for example, if your gross income is $100,000 and you are married, you'll pay \[$100,000-(1.5\* $17240) \]\*.1 per year in student loans. this comes out to $7,414 a year or $618 a month, a pretty hefty portion of your salary.however, let's take a look at the calculation methodology. it's based on adjusted gross income, not gross income. that means contributing to your 401k, traditional ira, or engaging in behaviors that reduce your agi will have a compound effect. also, the student loan interest deduction will also reduce your agi, but you'll be deducting that regardless.let's imagine you save 20% of your income in a combination of a 401(k) and traditional ira, your new agi will be $80,000. instead of paying $7,414 a year in student loans, you now pay $5,414 or $451 a month. an additional 10% savings to the taxes you save from these deductions. also, this is likely a higher percentage of your disposable income than 10% because most college-educated people are not living at the 150% of the state poverty line.this just shifts the people away from using roth 401(k)'s and roth ira's, and benefits those that save a higher percentage of their income. for those that have high disposable incomes, high debt, and two working members, maxing out two 401(k)s results in a $3,900 reduction in yearly payments, which could change the decision of whether to refinance or go on an income-based repayment plan. also, for those wondering the additional compound interest on principal will not outweigh the reduction in payments.**tl;dr: reduce agi, reduce monthly and overall student loan payments.**",3,1,How to save money paying back student loans on Income-DrivenRepayment Plans,Finance

23648,"hello!  i recently voluntarily left my job of approximately 18 months for a better opportunity. i expected to have to repay a prorated portion of my relocation lump sum bonuses i received (2 year contract)they finally reached out with a statement about a month after leaving. i signed the contracts, and i am willing to pay what i owe back. however, i am a little lost at the break down and was hoping someone could shed some light on this to see if it is at all accurate, and if it is not, what changes need to be made to correct this before extending correct payment. i received my first relocation bonus august 2019 for moving from my college town to my first assigned location (in &gt; ky (in work location)). it was $5,000 broken into 2 payments. the first half was 30 days before my start date, the second 30 days after. the second bonus was a lump sum $7,000 for moving to a new location, paid december 2019 (ky &gt; oh). this was only one payment. both bank statements reflect the full amounts stated, so these are “post tax” amounts. the first $5k was prorated to approximately 30% of the original value, leaving me to owe approximately $1.6k.  the second $7k shows as $11.3k on that line (i’m assuming pre-tax value? but i’m entirely unsure) prorated to about 50%, leaving me to pay about $5.7k. in total, they are saying i owe them $7.3k in repayments prior to “tax corrections”. they did include tax corrects of $2.5k, leaving me with my final balance due at $4.8k. doing rough math in my head at my time of resignation, i planned to owe approximately $2.5-3k, but admittedly i am not the best at math. my first question- is there any clear reason anyone here can see as to why the first bonus shows at the lump sum paid to me, while the second shows the (again, i’m assuming) pre tax value of my lump sum? would it be correct for me to ask them to correct the line from 11.3 to 7?  my second question, is there anything i need or should be doing to reflect this for my taxes this year?  thank you in advance!!!",3,1,Relocation Bonus Repayment Question!,Finance

25591,"hi all,forgive my noobness, it's my first time posting to this sub. in the past when i was a teen and in my mid 20s i was pretty terrible with money: low income, no savings, f\*\*\*ed around on a credit card. usual dumbass behaviour you can expect from people growing up with very little guidance.now that i'm in my 30s, i'm much more stable. i have a decent job that i went to college for, i don't party even 10% the amount i used to, i have a car, i have an apartment, i have a gf, i have the majority of a 10 year plan all thought out and timelined. what i don't have however is a viable way to secure the money necessary for a down payment on a house. i live in a part of canada where the average home price is well over $600k (cad dollars). my monthly take home is about $3200 after taxes and deductions based on a $52k a year salary.a little bit about my monthly expenses:my rent that i split 2 ways is $560 a month. i buy groceries and ""eating out"" if it does occur is maybe a once a month domino's order that i only ever get on mondays (50% off). i make my own coffee, i make my own breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with thoughtfully purchased ingredients based on a meal plan. i used to drink a fair amount, maybe several hundred dollars a month worth. that sounds like a lot, and it kinda was, but in this part of canada we tax the hell out of alcohol so your money goes far less distance on beer than it would in say most of america. i've cut down heavily on drinking to just a modest amount on weekends and none of it is done in bars. my main and most glaring expense is my car. i drive to a different city to work, about 1-2 hours each way depending on what jobsite i'm traveling to. jobs in my field just don't exist in my city. car payments are $250/month, gas is about $400/month, and insurance is about $550/month on a 9 year old nissan altima. in the past i've been a smoker, but thankfully quit for good about 3 or 4 years ago.before you jump down to reply, i fully understand that my car expenses are astronomical. and yes, moving to a closer city to the jobsites is 100% my short term goal within 6 months. however, i've done the math, and the money i would be saving in insurance and gas would immediately be allocated into rent based on the insane, some may say unconscionable, spike in property values in the last year in canada. my landlord right now would charge me an extra $300 a month if not for the fact that my rent is grandfathered in after living in my apartment for several years. that being said, i still live in one of the cheapest areas in my geographical region. moving anywhere else to be closer to my job is akin to burning hundreds of dollars in cash every month. even bachelor apartments in my region are over $1000 a month. i don't live in toronto or vancouver.now, here's my main concern. i've extensively budgeted and reconfigured my monthly expenses to be more modest and take into account what i'd be able to save if i completely eliminated all unnecessary expenses (of which there are basically none at this point). if i have a good month where i'm a good little boy and have zero fun and no emergencies like a car repair happen, i can save $500 a month. car repairs of course will need to happen, so i'm looking at &lt;$500 or $500 deductible paid on a large repair job. worst case scenario i need to have no less than that in my savings account just so i can still get to and from work.the average cost of a home in my region like i said is about $600k for a single family dwelling. anything cheaper than that and you're looking at living in rougher areas with rampant drug use and poverty (the opioid crisis in canada is unbelievable). so, even if i had the ability to save $500 consistently every month, for a proper down payment of even 20% on a crappy starter home ($250k), would be $50,000. it means 100 months of saving and not having any ability to go out once or even get a hamburger from mcdicks. that's 8 years and change of robot-mode, don't get sick, don't get into any accidents, don't buy any gifts for bdays or christmas for anyone, never buy anything for yourself even a book or game.other than going back to college in order to get myself an education that would grant me a job that earns $80k+ in order to comfortably save for a down payment, how does one go about getting a house in 2020 and beyond even if they earn over the median income? even living in small towns in my region doesn't save any money. it's just as expensive to live in a town of 5000 people as it is to live in a town of 500k people. i'm willing to hear suggestions as to what i can economize on monthly in order to increase my savings, but it just seems so impossible. halp!",308,1,How the hell am I supposed to save enough money for a house down payment?,Finance

27120,"hi, so i got myself into a rough spot about a year and a half ago. i lived in a college house with five other people and i was the sole person on the utilities. this house was also very expensive to heat and cool as it was old and large. as it turns out, a few people refused to pay on their way out and trashed the place (i hadn’t been there for the last six months) so i lost most of my portion of the deposit and was owed hundreds of dollars for utilities. i was in a tight spot and didn’t have the money to pay both the utilities in full and rent/deposit for a new place so i let a large utility lapse. i spent the remaining time in college too broke to pay it and then graduated into a pandemic and my financial situation has been the same. well i had been making plans to incrementally pay the debt (as it was separated into several smaller chunks while in collections) and i wanted to improve my credit score especially as i’m trying to get a place of my own now. i had never been contacted by the collections agency and i never attempted to contact because i wasn’t in a position to pay and i didn’t see what good that would do. but i checked my score today and as of last week the majority of the derogatory marks have been removed (4 of 6) and my score increased by 45 points. leaving a much more manageable sum for me to pay off by the time i want to move. yay, i think? but maybe not? because i had done some research and it was my understanding that by paying in full and not negotiating done i could get my score to increase by 20 points per mark. but these four being removed by only increased it by 45. so this leaves me with questions. 1. will future creditors see that these were removed but not paid and look down on that? 2. is it weird that they were removed after only about 18 months? 3. should i still pay the remaining for the boost to my credit or do i have that wrong and it’s not worth it if it saves me a couple of hundred dollars? 4. will this come back to haunt me in anyway? it feels unsettling knowing i had a debt with collections and it was removed without any kind of communication. thanks for any insight you might have.",11,1,"Derogatory Marks due to Collections suddenly gone from credit report, blessing or curse?",Finance

27626,"title says it all. i am wondering what i can do to reduce the impact on my financial future. a little about me: i am currently a graduate student about to finish an ma program. over christmas break i went home and was going through some old mail that had gotten lost in my room and discovered two old medical bills had been sent to collections. about three years ago i suddenly started having bad headaches and no one could figure out why. i was sent to the emergency room and then eventually to get a ct scan. luckily they found nothing seriously wrong and the problem eventually sorted itself out. at the time i was a 19 year old college undergraduate and did not have any source of income. insurance did not cover the entire bill and my parents said they were going to handle the rest. i didn't think anything else about it. unfortunately, they did not handle it. it turns out that around that same time my parents were also struggling with money. they weren't living paycheck to paycheck, but a couple of emergencies had zapped their savings. as a regular middle class family with two kids in college, they just didn't have any extra money laying around to pay the bills. so, from what they told me, they just put the bill off until they had enough to cover it. however, they eventually just forgot about it. my sister broke her foot a little later that year and in all the chaos of paying her bills they misremembered thinking they had also paid mine. so when mail kept coming to the house with my name on it, they never opened it thinking the situation was handled, all the while the bills were actually being sent into collections. the company that bought my debt only sent one letter as far as i know, which is the one old letter i found over the break. it's been in collections two years now and i had absolutely no idea. so, looking past the actions of my parents (who had good intentions) and my incompetence (of losing mail and never checking my credit score because i didn't think i needed to) what should be my next step? i'll be graduating in april and looking for work so i can hopefully pay these off soon. is there a way to pay them that will keep the damage to my credit score to a minimum? i'll also add that it will probably take me time to build up the money to pay them off. i'll have plenty of undergraduate debt to pay as well. luckily i did well enough in undergrad to get the ma for free, but my undergrad debt will be a significant drain on my funds for awhile.",6,1,Graduate Student Who Discovered I Have Medical Bills in Collections,Finance

28001,"throwaway because this has the potential to get more specific than i'm comfortable with on my main account.  i apologize ahead of time for the wall of text, as i'm sure folks here can appreciate the topic of money can be uncomfortable among peers. as a millennial (35), those sort of discussions overwhelmingly seem to trend towards commiseration. i'm hoping to get some perspective from others who *aren't* struggling.    what it comes down to is i'm having trouble figuring out where to draw the line when it comes to savings. i feel like this is the opposite of most younger folks in this sub, so the topic feels a little awkward. i started out my adult life with a head start. my grandparents were wealthy and started all their grandchildren investment accounts at a young age to give them a leg up with education, starting a family, etc. from very early on i knew that i had an investment account and learned the basics of compound interest and the value of not spending needlessly. over the years, i used some of that money to buy a car, and pay for college (though i never finished - that's another story), as well as a down payment on my first house. other than those major (arguably necessary) life expenses, though, i've been very good about touching those funds as little as possible.    i've got some pretty serious add which, for those who don't know, means that i have trouble keeping up with something like a budget. i might be able to come up with some initial numbers and a system, but once the novelty of it wears off, it's really hard for me to remember to categorize everything etc. most budgeting tools i played with over the years did a really poor job automatically handling the case where most purchases are put on credit cards paid in full, especially with multiple accounts involved. this led to me creating my own simple system to keep spending/savings in check.   i'll give a quick rundown of how my system works for context:    i treat my cash flow as a series of buckets with a hierarchy and a limit. additionally, i break my expenses into only 2 categories, ""personal"" and ""home"". i have separate accounts for these two categories, which serve as the aforementioned ""buckets"". direct deposit goes into ""personal checking"" which is the only account i really keep much of an eye on. i figured out ballpark how much my mortgage, utilities, etc cost per month, rounded up by a healthy margin, cut that in half, and set up an automatic transfer for that amount twice a month from ""personal checking"" to ""house checking"" in order to cover my major bills without having to think about it. i pay for nearly everything with my credit cards and pay those off immediately (sometimes multiple times a month just because). the savings/budget strategy i use is to make use of my bank's ""scheduled transactions"" feature. it shows what the theoretical balance will be as each future transaction takes place for the next 45 days or so. i arbitrarily picked a value of \~1k for each checking account as the minimum balance i ever want to see. so every time i log in, i'll check to see where the projected low point is for each account and if it's significantly more than that target number, i'll transfer the 'extra' from the checking account to it's corresponding hysa. i have one each for both ""personal"" and ""house"" - again, kept separate. those accounts each have their own target balance, intended to cover things like a major repair etc. once *those* accounts go past their threshold, the remainders goes into a single account where i pick up etfs etc. i've also got that original investment account, a 401k, and a roth ira.    *so what's the problem?* this system is designed to trick myself into saving money. i intentionally and proactively move cash out of my 'spending' account before i can spend it. i keep it at a level where i *can* buy things if i want, but i don't because i might dip below my self-imposed limits. it's all set up in such a way that i'm never actually in any danger, but i'm very conscious of any money i spend because i'm trying to maintain that balance. my worry is that it's too extreme. between my various accounts, my balance is getting close to $500k. i don't live in a high col area (rural pa), am single, and make around $60k. unless i'm missing something obvious, based on the ""rule of 72"" at a 7% average return i'd hit 2 million by age 55 if i didn't save *literally anything else* for the rest of my career. a 3% annual draw on that would be my current salary, and that's seemingly not out of the question as the majority of my money is already outside of a retirement account.    if that's actually the case, i feel like i should be able to stop tricking myself into feeling broke just to save a couple bucks buying the generic cereal. i just have no idea how to give myself permission. i'm the sort of person who finishes a video game having never used a potion because i was saving them just in case. i'm worried that my life is headed in that same sort of trajectory. in my position should i realistically be deprioritizing savings and focusing on quality of life things that aren't easy to rationalize as 'necessary'?  how do you 'budget' for buying things you don't *need*? do you set aside money with the actual intent that it *must* be spent frivolously?    **tl;dr: i'm concerned that i'm too focused on saving. i feel like i don't know how to give myself permission to spend money on things i don't need. can't really talk to friends about this because** ***""boo hoo, i'm worried i'm too far ahead""***",9,1,Where to draw the line when it comes to savings,Finance

no more, no less.2.  do your laundry on quarter draft night (the laundry room will be empty). fold your clothes before you put them away. don't use liquid fabric softener on towels, they will shed water like a well oiled duck. wash your sheets on thursday (you never know).3.  keep your dorm room clean. don't use febreze.4.  don't drive if you can ride the bus; don't ride the bus if you can bike; don't bike if you can walk.5.  don't study in the library stacks; too many people will walk around and disturb you. study in the asian heritage section; no one ever goes in there.6.  take the time to find the hidden burrito place; it will save your life when you're really hungry and it's a good place to take someone on the first date.7.  get a work study job in the library if you can; food service work study will make you angry.8.  don't try to study outside.9.  don't defend your music/book/movie/political tastes by attacking another's.10. don't take up smoking as a habit, no matter what.11. write notes on anything and everything.12. don't buy one of those nifty id cases with a keyring attached.13. don't fall for the easy student credit card applications.14. learn the name of the janitor who cleans your dorm and your class buildings.15. your first roommate is the first person you meet on campus. it's also the first person you will have disagreements with. remember, he will be gone at the end of the year, but you'll remember him for the rest of your life.16. get stupid-loud-emotional-puking drunk once. once is all it takes.17. learn to be homesick, but do it alone.18. you will get horribly, terribly, awfully sick at some point during your first semester. don't try to fight it or deny that it will happen to you. go to the clinic, get some anti-biotics and let it happen. it will save you for the next 4 years.19. only order take-out once a month. tip the delivery guy well (30-50%, he's most likely a student like you working his way through school).20. walk to bars; take a cab home.21. never drink alone in your room.22. if you find yourself in a townie bar, have one beer, tip the bartender well and leave. if you go back, the bartender won't ask you for your drink order, he or she will just set it up on the bar for you without asking. it's an amazing thing to see when someone in service treats you with respect. return it.23. find time to go to the gym.24. study two hours for every hour in class.25. eat in the dining hall. avoid foods that don't involve silverware. don't carb load at breakfast, eat a good-sized lunch, and don't overdo it at dinner. sit down, eat slow. it should take about an hour per meal.26. there are 168 hours in every week. subtract all of the class, study, gym, and eating time. you'll find that you won't be able to sleep 8 hours everyday. this is life, and it will prepare you for adulthood. nothing interesting happens while you sleep, if it does, you shouldn't have been asleep in the first place.27. your professors (the ones with dr. in front of their names or ph. d. after) are your first employers. learn what you need to learn but question them if it doesn't fit. in the end, they will be your job references after college.28. your graduate assistants and adjuncts are your peers. they have a lot of useful and pertinent information about how to get through these four years and in the end, the good ones will become your friends. some of my good friends were once my ga's and adjuncts and we still chat frequently.29. you will have veterans in your classes. some folks around you will dismiss their training and experience. they have real world knowledge and have earned your respect.30. drink cheap beer when offered (bud light, miller lite, coors light). drink good beer at the bar (sam adams, dos equis, heineken). keep better beer in your fridge (murphy's, bass, flat tire).31. wean yourself off caffeine during finals week. this may sound counter-intuitive, but trust me on this one.32. you are not entitled to your opinion, you're only entitled to what you can defend.33. you don't deserve a good grade for showing up. you didn't pay for ""a""s, you paid for the seat. effort pays off, attendance is part of that. it's your money, make sure its well spent.34. find your professors' offices and learn their hours; you'll need them.35. accept that you will make mistakes and ask for help. it's easier to recover this way than trying to handle it on your own.36. be firm in your convictions; if you don't believe in something, chances are, you'll believe anything.37. there is always a quiet place in the student center. you can usually nap there during the day.38. when you're walking, keep your feet, but keep your head up. you'll be amazed at how many people will greet you when they can see your face.39. don't judge anyone by the anything other than their actions. you don't know their story, just as they don't know yours.40. don't text someone in the same room as you. if it can't be said aloud, it can wait until you're in private.41. don't email someone in the same building. get up, walk to where ever he or she is and tell them face to face.42. not everything needs to be said. you'll learn what these things are as you go along.43. don't refuse an invitation to meet someone's parents. shake their hands and refer to them as sir and/or ma'am until/unless they tell you otherwise. not before.44. your first summer job will set you up for success for the rest of your college career.46. go to the free concerts on campus.47. become a football fan.48. the other people around you are in the same situation as you are. they are all scared, excited, tired, and apprehensive. you are learning how to adult; its a process; drive it when you can, but more importantly let it happen. the only thing you control are your own actions.49. listen to music at a moderate volume in your dorm room with the door open and without headphones. good conversation starter.50. volunteer.51. understand what social location is, then pay no attention to it.52. buy a tailored suit.53. it will probably be required, but even if it isn't, take a sports class.54. don't eat from the vending machines. buy a package of your favorite snack and hide it.55. hide money in the pockets of your clean clothes.56. when people hang out in your room, don't let them sit on your bed. during this time in your life when personal space is virtually non-existent, your bed is the closest thing to a sanctuary that you will have.57. make sure people take their garbage with them when they leave. this includes emotional garbage.58. the required classes fill up early. learn what a ""force add"" is and use it.59. wear shower shoes in the shower.60. wear house shoes unless you're leaving the building.61. own a crazy set of pajamas. wear them to your earliest final every semester.62. send your mother a birthday card every year.63. don't let your personal life become a hassle for your roommates or your ra. they are students too.64. don't try to drill a hole in the keg to get to the beer inside. a repair bill for the consequences is not a joke. trust me on this one.65. sit in the front of the class.66. wear a hat and a heavy coat when the weather gets cold; a hoodie won't cut it.67. wear shorts whenever possible.68. flip flops are perfectly acceptable. crocs are never acceptable.69. get up early on the weekends. your monday self will thank you.70. learn how to fix your own appliances. youtube and a good parts website will keep you from accumulating a storage bin full of easily repaired coffee makers.71. dress for dinner on friday nights and encourage your friends to do the same. jacket and tie for the men and a skirt/dress just above the knee for the ladies. even if you’re eating in the dining halls, this will attract the right people to your sphere.",0,1,From my dad,Adult

926,"so i’ll start off saying that i have never been to a psychiatrist or diagnosed with any mental illness. i don’t like to say that i am depressed because i was never actually diagnosed with it and i do not want to take away from people who do have it. i know some people are so depressed that they cannot even leave their house to do their daily activities. however, ever since the start of my senior year i’ve been very sad most of the time. right around that time i also started smoking weed. i’ve usually been able to keep it only to the weekends but there were some times when i realized i was becoming dependent on it for happiness. about halfway through my first semester at college i decided to stop for a while and made it about a month and a half without it. however, i noticed that this did not have a great impact on the happiness with life. because of this i think that it is a coincidence that i became sad and started smoking weed around the same time. i have a very hard time talking about myself to anyone but i knew one of my friends takes prozac for depression/ anxiety and has seen a psychologist and used to see a therapist. so i asked him about a year ago if he felt better after doing all of those things and he said yes. a couple weeks before i asked him this i had a kind of breakdown at his house when we were hanging out (i was high at the time tho but it’s also happened sober.) and he said that he thinks i might have some kind of anxiety problem. about halfway through senior year i got into my first real relationship with a girl which ended up lasting about 2 months. she also took prozac but i never talked to her about it. since it was my first relationship i didn’t really know what to do and it ended up being kinda toxic which i think was mostly my fault. i want to be in a relationship again but i don’t think i need to improve myself more first.now back to the period when i was taking a break from weed that same friend asked me if i was interested in doing shrooms. i was a bit scared at first but after doing more research about how they could be potentially beneficial in helping with depression/self exploration i was more interested in them. i was however scared of having a bad trip as i had just failed out of one of my classes for my major and was very stressed about that at the time. so i ended up taking a very small amount and had a good time but it didn’t affect me mentally at all which is was kinda sad about since that’s the main reason i wanted to take them.fast forward to present day and now i have been smoking everyday for the past two weeks. i know that it’s not sustainable for the long term and i want to try and improve my situation but i have always had a hard time actually putting my thoughts into action. i think i might want to go see a psychiatrist/therapist but since i have a very hard time opening up to people i don’t know how much that will really help me plus i would probably have to get my parents to pay for it and that would mean talking to them about it which would be very hard for me to do. sorry the post is all over the place. i tried to make it pretty short but there’s a lot to tell and a lot that i couldn’t even fit but i guess i just wanted to write it down. any advice is appreciated. thanks!",5,1,possible depression?? idk,Adult
938,"so it’s my (18m) first year of college and we just started spring semester. i went random for my roommate and we still don’t really get along. we never fight or anything but we almost never talk. there are some days we will go the entire day without talking once. i’m more of an introvert but i talk to my close friends from high school for hours on end. i tried to talk to him at the beginning of the semester but i think he just doesn’t like talking to me.  this was fine for a while but it started to affect me. whenever we’re in the room together it gives me extreme anxiety because it’s so silent. however he’s almost always in the room (if he’s not in class he’s in the dorm). also our sleep schedules do not align ( he goes to bed at 9:30 and gets up at 6:30 and is very loud doing it). because of this i’m starting to wonder if i’m just not cut out for dorm life. i think it’s too late to do anything about it this semester but i need to start thinking about next year. one of my other friends has a single and says it’s pretty nice but i’m concerned that i’d just be more antisocial locked up in my room. also it’s more expensive so there’s that. the second option is to commute which is only like a 20 minute drive. however, i really don’t like the idea of commuting because i still want to hang out on campus a lot (but it is cheaper). the last option is to go random on a roommate again but i’d rather commute before doing this so it’s not really an option. sorry about the long post and i don’t really know where i’m going with this but i just don’t know what to do at this point. i guess if you have any advice for what to do about any of it that would be helpful. thanks!",6,1,What to do about my roommate situation?,Adult

1365,"hey guys/girls, hope y'all are having a splendid day. 🙂 this gonna be a long post and i need to vent a bit so grab some popcorn or candy 😅. so, first a background: i'm 20 years old and i am a 1st generation mexican-american. i was born in the u.s. followed by three younger siblings. 2 brothers; one is 16 and the other is 7 &amp; 1 sister who is 10. both my parents 💯 full blooded mexicans who came from mexico to u.s. for a better future. my father is an immigrant, he doesn't have any papers whatsoever so all my life i've been working hard to get to a point where i can help him to relax and have me do hard work for him cause i'm worried. my mother, however, isn't a u.s. citizen but a u.s. resident or something like that. i'm at a point where i feel like i am just now starting my life experiences like bills and car management and insurance and work all that good stuff needless to say the life essentials too like cooking and cleaning and such. but like i said i'm at a point where i feel like i'm just not ready to go out into the world 🌍, but then again reality and life are never easy and sometimes one has to take a leap of faith no matter what. i watch anime and i was watching a certain one i've been putting off until now called tsukigakirei which is about 2 main characters, boy and girl, who as you'd expect fall in love over time in their last year of middle school with plot twists and such. anyways i was watching it and uh i started to remember my times in middle school with my relationships and how i was back then. to be honest the main male character reminded me of myself back then. anyways i was watching it and i got to a good stopping point 🛑 and i started to ponder over my life and how it has grown and changed. luckily it didn't evolve into an existential crisis but i was getting there. 🤯😅few hours later i got to work, i work nights with my father and my mother works same place but on days, and i almost always say hello to my mother. today i did do that and we started talking about random things until she asks me one question. she says: ""what if we all go to cherán, as a family, and stay there from there on?"" cherán is the name of my heritage town and where my parents grew up. after my mother asked me that question i stood speechless, but i was able to mutter that i didn't know. but after thinking about it for awhile i wouldn't want to. as much much much as i would want to stay with my family in cherán i wouldn't want to. or need to for that matter. why? here's why i thought it over and over and i came upon the answer no. but i didn't know why. so let it go for awhile and kept on with my work. here at work i a good friend i made who was actually a friend from high school we both didn't know but after we realized we become good friends. we got to talking and then he brings up that sometime in november he's moving. i don't know where but he's moving. i told him congratulations and to enjoy this milestone of his. we departed with our work and i remembered that my cousin in carolina moved in with her boyfriend and is no longer living with her family. and i also realized as well that my my best friend is also living with his girlfriend and they're about to have a child. then i remembered my first year of college when i stayed at the dorms. i was rough at first as well as emotional. but i got through and at that time i realized that at some point ny parents and siblings won't always be by my side and that i'll have to take care of myself. i payed the school bill with my parents money they were providing. they just provided the money to pay the school bill, so it was up to me to pay it up and do the rest. i also found a part time job that time and so i realized even more how, in a way, they were starting up back then when they came to america, but for then it was harder. input this all up in my brain 🧠 and realized exactly why i didn't want to stay in cherán. because, i won't always be with my family and my family won't always be by me. and at some point the child has to go. i'm 20 and i need to learn how to take care of myself sure yeah but i also need to learn to mature &amp; how to take care of myself emotionally and mentally. physically everyone know how to take care of themselves at a a young age. this is my reason why and if it does possibly happen it'll hurt like hell im going to be a crying bitch. and that's okay.  i might not ever see them in a long time, unless i go for vacation, but in a good way, it could also by my catalyst to maturing into the real world. one that came at a price. and even then, as time will pass, things always get better eventually.if you've read this far, i greatly thank you 🤝🙏🏽👍🏽 and appreciate for taking the time off your day to read this long ass venting post. thank you...🇲🇽🇺🇲",0,1,Hey guys.,Adult

2890,"so, i’m a 19 year old currently entering my sophomore year of college. while i enjoyed my freshman year, it was a little limited due to my parent’s refusal to establish boundaries. they monitor my bank account, they track my location, and they get furious if they find out i’m doing any drinking or drugs.now, i could handle all of that when i was in high school. it was kind of fun sneaking around and trying to come up with creative ways to get around their rules, and i think it helped me develop into a more complete person with a better idea of what i deem important (i’m far from a “grown up”, but i know what i value in life and i know it’s different than what they value). but, as a young adult, especially as a young adult entering his second year of adulthood, i’m sick of it.so, i thought of a way to partially mitigate the problem, but i have no real idea if executing it would be a good idea. essentially, my plan is create my own bank account independent from theirs, slowly transfer all my money over in ways they won’t recognize (cash back on groceries, telling them i’m spending cash when i’m really not, that kind of thing), and then once i’m done fully transferring all of my paychecks and any other income to the new account.i feel bad being so deceptive, but every time i try to approach the issue with them they fly off the handle and call me immature and irresponsible. i get it, no parent wants their kids to be drinking or smoking pot, but i don’t really drink and i’ve been safely and responsibly enjoying pot since i was like 15. i’ve had a job since i was 16 (not currently due to corona but i still have the position) and i have a full-ride merit based scholarship to a top 5 public university. i’ll admit that i’m a fuck up, like most teenagers, but i’d like to think i’m more responsible than they give me credit for. anyways, i don’t know much about the logistics of setting up a new bank account, although i can’t imagine it’s nearly as risky as, say, signing up for a credit card without consulting them. as long as i don’t overdraw then i can’t see how i could go into debt or anything. any advice or feedback would be helpful, thanks in advance.tl;dr i (19) want to open a new bank account to achieve financial independence from my helicopter parents, but i know very little about the logistics.",4,1,Looking For Advice,Adult

2908,"hey y’all, i’m a latino male, 27. i recently moved in with my grandmother. i did so because she’s widowed, lonely and physically unable to  move around without a cane/stroller type thing, so my goal was to help her out a little while living here. things like helping her stand up occasionally, getting groceries, grabbing food from fridge, just being there, etc. i was living at home before, but pre-covid, moved here. things are eh, and i’ve started to feel a little...resentment towards her. let me explain.i’ve actually been doing this since i graduated high school. i grew up very close to her, and feel this obligation to help her in whatever way i can. i didn’t move out of my hometown because i wanted to be with her til the very end. and she helps me out too by offering money sometimes and letting me live rent free, which i really appreciate. and i even committed myself to not permanently/temporarily moving out of town because i know she’d be lonely. she seems like her angel...but only recently am i starting to feel like she’s starting to suck the life force out of me. although she’s very fragile and very caring as a latina grandma, she’s 84 and it’s frustrating. she makes me anxious at times, consistently complains at me for not eating enough and frequently asks for help. i feel she annoys me easily because she talks to me like she’s my mom, and i tell her to please respect when i can’t accept an offer but she still pushes me. and in the past, she’d call me while doing things for myself (with gf/friends/or having to myself) to help with small things, like bring in her laundry, picking up groceries or going to the atm for her. once, she’s called asking me to come like she was entitled to my time, which angered me (she doesn’t do that now). and although i love her and she says she feels bad for asking for my attention a lot, i feel i made the wrong choice to move here. i think i walked into a caretaker role, whether or not i like it. and i have the means to move on my own, i just don’t know if i’m an asshole for wanting to bounce already.i’m also just starting to get serious about my career and studying for the cpa exams, but i feel distracted knowing she needs my help. it makes me anxious and breaks my study routine. i even move my books and laptop to study in the living room with her but it’s hard to focus with her tv on. and what makes me sad is that i will have to do this for my own parents when they’re split. my moms side isn’t close to my abuela. and my dad and uncle (her sons) are just not there enough for her emotionally. dad is too impatient and is a workaholic and my uncle moved out of country years ago and cares only for himself. so i feel responsible for being here. and i feel anchored because my grandma constantly says she’d ra her have me here over them. tl;dr: live with grandma, rest of family isn’t doing enough for her. been her help we since college and now second guessing living with her, i’m gettin depressed and feel like i’m missing out on some youth and privacy. nearing 30s.i feel trapped. would i be wrong to move out and live my own life?",1,1,Considering on moving out?,Adult

3300,"^(warning: contains sexual references, reference to legal-gray-area actions. shouldn’t be an issue with subreddit rules, but just be cognizant that i won’t be mincing my words.)this post is also a bit long, apologies—i can be verbose. **approx reading time: 11-13 mins (2,500ish words).** i also apologize for the clickbait-y title. it was originally meant to be ""emotional vulnerability"", but let's be honest, this title sounds far more interesting. i think it gives different feel to my work and my story of debauchery and general delinquency.i wrote this little piece after i broke up with my girlfriend, about 1.5 months ago. i’ve talked to a few people from reddit (some from this sub too) about this whole thing and have mostly moved on from it, but i just wanted to post this. it’s tough for me to completely open up to people in my daily life (especially with some of my hobbies), but it’s far easier to open up to people like y’all—i feel like i can write to you without being judged. to those of you who i’ve been talking to (whether it’s been over the last two years or mere days), i really appreciate the unique type of friendship and advice you’ve offered me, along with getting to know you guys and y’all becoming familiar with me. still, there’s something therapeutic about writing out my feelings and submitting them with a bit more anonymity on a forum like this, so here we are. i’m sitting in my room on a lazy saturday night, looking over all the drafts of posts that i never ended up submitting as i sip some tea and listen to modern-day amy winehouse soundalikes (snoh aalegra, emeryld—shout to my boys who don’t care if their music taste is “feminine”) as i grow utterly nostalgic reading some of these (this post not included).anyways, this preface has been long enough. here’s my mildly heartfelt story. i hope you enjoy it, find it informative, or perhaps can relate to it in some way. i was a bit apprehensive to post this, so i hope i don’t regret it.-“i’m not an emotional guy”, i thought to myself as i cried in my car.but for some reason, i felt utterly shattered. at the time, i just didn’t—and several hours later—still don’t understand the intense emotions that i was feeling. i’ve never felt this way before.for the uninitiated in my unentertaining saga, i ascertained that i would break up with my girlfriend before i moved to college. i broke up with her exactly a week ago. i tried to put it in the kindest words that my small heart was able to find, but the crestfallen expression on her face left me in a mess. her eyes have always revealed her emotions, and this was no exception. i lost myself in them one last time, and proceeded to tightly grip her and pul her into a hug. she went limp on my shoulder. i could hear her crying. her tears dripped down my jacket. it was a gift that she had given to me for my birthday. it was a crisp jacket by schott, made with a thick horsehide leather. she was always worried about me getting into a crash on my motorcycle and turning into a human crayon, so she purchased the jacket for me. i wore it every time i picked her up on my bike, and, out of habit, i had done it today. i didn’t know if i should give it back to her. i decided to keep her gifts, and told her to keep mine. we shouldn’t look at it with sadness, our relationship was wonderful.i’m not an emotional guy. i swear.i spent most of that saturday in bed. i didn’t work out, didn’t get too much work done either. i flaked on my training partner. he understood. i ended up going out with my friends to clé *(a/n: s.o htx)* later that night, but i wasn’t really feeling it. on sunday, i got back on track with my schedule. i just felt a bit more hollow and robotic than normal.my best friend told me to go out with him and some other buddies on that tuesday. i figured i would. it just felt vapid. we paid an outrageous amount for two bottles of grey goose and a bottle of hennessy. my friends introduced me to a couple girls that night, but i just didn’t want to talk to them. i didn’t feel like drinking, and left early.that day, when i drove back in my dad’s r8 (he doesn’t mind at all) that i had pulled out of the family garage, i drove particularly recklessly that day, attempting to invoke some sort of excitement. nothing. powered through a few turns, went double the limit on the highway. my heart-rate remained steady. that was uncharacteristic for me, it didn’t take much to get adrenaline pumping through my system, if i’m being honest.it’s funny. i should be so grateful. caring friends, a wonderful family, a wealthy background, a bright future. i shouldn’t feel so torn up about some stupid breakup. i shouldn’t let it catapult me into some sort of mild, prolonged sadness.but it still did.*a/n: i think at this point, it’s important to note that your mental health is one of those things that is often taken for granted. even the slightest bit of trauma and worries can have effects on you. you must take the time to be reflective/mindful and acknowledge these issues, followed by seeking out treatment for them. i failed to do this for a long time.*anyways, my core group of friends invited me to dinner with them all on friday. no shenanigans, no partying, none of it—just a group of friends gathering before college started. i’ll admit, i was happy to be around all of them, to catch up, exchange some stories, and get some face-time with all of them. it was good to get to talk to them all. i didn’t reveal that i was torn up about the breakup, but i’m sure some of them could infer that it had left me a bit less soulful. my best friend, j, and his girlfriend, offered to introduce me to one of her friends and go out on a double date next week. i agreed. i don’t want anything serious, but they’re both well-aware of my intentions. we’ll see how it goes.*a/n (me, a handful of weeks older): it went okay. she was cute and bubbly. it’s obvious that j’s girlfriend chose her and knew what i was looking for. she got a little drunk and i, mildly intoxicated myself, had to carry her to the uber since she wasn’t a fan of her heels. we had fun that night. it was nice. she was a bit too cuddly considering the fact that we had met literally hours beforehand though. i just wanted to sleep afterwards.*here’s the one thing. the guys in my friend group can be idiots sometimes, but they know how to have a good time. after dinner, they pushed me to go out with them, which i hesitantly agreed to. after, they told me what they had really planned.-so this isn’t the first time that i’ve dabbled with a sex provider. i’ve been regularly seeing escorts ever since i had turned 18. i have a decent amount of experience with providers. doubles sessions, i once hired a girl to spend 24 hours with my ex and i (to get my bi-curious ex comfortable with her before proceeding), probably over 35 bookings at this point (most were around 4 hours apiece, as i like longer appointments). our group is very familiar with them in general, it’s not considered taboo among us and is actually rather common. so when they told me they had booked me an overnight, their treat, with my favorite escort in the area, i was both surprised and unsurprised. frankly, i was most concerned that they had my id available for screening info. i think they had it saved from an old airbnb booking where we had to send in our ids.*a/n: please don’t inquire too much about escorts/providers in the comment section. i don’t want to break any serious rules by disclosing any details on how to book an escort. i feel like i’ve already done that in a comment here before. if you’re curious about general details not related to actually booking an escort but rather the experience, feel free to ask in the comments since that shouldn’t be a big issue (at least, i’d hope that this sub is kosher with it, since i’m avoiding source talk); if you want to learn how to book a escort, please refrain from asking in a comment and dm me instead.*part of me didn’t want to go through with it, but equally, my irrational, lizard-brained side decided to slither out and influence my actions.so i hopped in my car and drove to her incall, less than two miles away, perched in a nicer apartment downtown. as the elevator made a “ding” sound at each level, my heart began to beat more and more quickly. i’m not usually nervous about many things, but i’ll admit, i was nervous to be with this woman—it was my first time seeing her in nearly a year. she still had my screening info on file, but so much had changed since our last rendezvous. i was mostly faithful to my girlfriend during our relationship, and this was my longest hiatus from the “single life”. i felt like a very different man than the one she had seen nearly a year ago. i was taken out of my thoughts as the elevator stopped, and i slowly walked to the door with her apartment number emblazoned next to it.i checked my phone to find that i was instructed to open the door—it was already unlocked.when i walked into her room, greeted by her sweet smell and beautiful smile, my nerves melted and i was instantly soothed. i was still very fresh and clean, so there was no necessity for a shower (but please take a shower for your provider’s sake if you’re even the slightest bit sweaty or unclean). we talked for a little bit and i complimented her new incall. it was in a beautiful area and the view of the city’s lights was intoxicated. she was clearly doing well for herself.sex was a big part of the relationship between my girl and i. it’s been a big part in nearly all of my relationships. i think it’s a great way for me to express myself and emotionally connect with a girl. it wasn’t the sex that had made me felt the way i had that night, however.we later moved to her bed and she rested her head on my chest and draped herself over me as she listened to me spill my heart, in almost the exact same position that my ex would find herself in when she fell asleep on me. this was different though. it made me felt loved in a way that i had never felt before. maybe it was her attentive listening, that you could tell that she was truly processing every word i said, as she thoughtfully crafted a response.i know, i know, you don’t have to say it. i know that this is her job, that it’s a bit of an illusion (iop is the term used by most hobbyists to describe this type of service), that she obviously doesn’t love me. that’s entirely true, but that warm feeling that i had that night was something that i’ve never experienced before. we spoke for hours. i confided my concerns with her about my previous relationships, namely apathy towards the relationship and how i felt that i had treated my exes as expendable. how i had cheated too often, as had most of my friends. i let their influence get to me, however i would have to shoulder most of the blame myself. i felt like i gave in too easily to temptations, that i took a lot of my relationships for granted, and how the last week had proved that to me (as i went into the breakup blasé and left as a hollow version of the man i was).-i told her to hit me. she slapped me across the face lightly. i told her to hit me again. this time it stung. once more, i repeated “again” and her slap left my face tingling. it was a good feeling.the experience was utterly cathartic, as i slowly released endorphins while she bucked on top of me, slapping me at regular intervals. the routine 10mg of cialis that i had taken this morning (not for ed, but for pumps in the gym and mild blood pressure control), 500mg of exogenous testosterone in my system, and a tendency to deathgrip my dick when masturbating *(a/n: shout out to my boys with deathgrip syndrome)* ensured that our foray into pleasure lasted quite a while. i felt like i was in a mildly drugged mental state by the end of it, and my physical state was mildly bruised and scratched up as well. my wits slowly returned to me as we sat in bed, both sweaty and exhausted. i was sweetly petted to sleep as she laid on my chest.-i woke up at my usual time that morning and bid my favorite provider adieu after taking a quick shower with her. i put my clothes back on and dragged my 40mm chelsea heels back to my car. once i entered the safety of my cockpit, i sat there for short time, thinking back to the events of the previous night. it was at that point that the tears began streaming down my face. i'm not entirely sure why i cried that morning. all i knew was that i felt broken and empty inside. i felt like my previous emotional attachments had meant nothing, and that i never felt truly ""loved"" in my life. i had been in numerous relationships and never felt this way, the way that i was coaxed into in the course of a single night with this woman. i had compartmentalized this side of myself and pushed it into the back of my head.-this whole piece is more than a story about breaking up with a pretty girl and having the emotions literally fucked out of me by an escort. for me, this experience is weird. i feel like i’ve suppressed my emotions for years. i think it has a lot to do with my parents being absent in my life starting my junior year of hs (they began to travel a lot for business, and slowly, for pleasure). i only saw them a few times per year for short one-week periods during hs, and will probably see them far less as i move to college.*a/n: yep. here's to seeing my parents twice per year from here on.*-so listen y’all—i know my writing is kind of shit (and cliché-laden) and this post is all over the place. regardless. i hope this is the kind of content that this sub might be interested in as it depicts the honest reality as a youngadult. i hope to see a similar subset of stories like this. i feel like we can really learn from each other’s unique experiences. i know this is the type of content that i would like to see (obviously it doesn’t have to be hookers and parties, i

4663,"i was a wonderfully energetic and kind kid. i was well adjusted and acclimated to the educational environment that all kids go through. i loved school, so much so that i did college level courses all throughout high school. i recall doing incredible on my examinations and even though i was socially regressed and had a bad at home life, i still managed to excel academically. school was my best friend, because nothing beats an education.i graduated at 18 with a full ride scholarship and was successful in pursuing a post secondary education. i was thrilled to continue my education while having the privilege to work at a lawful occupation with a schedule that allowed for me to study and pursue classes. i will never forget how much i adored the structural integrity provided to me at such a young age, as it gave me many positive outlets. i loved having the right to bear arms, purchase goods and services, pay my bills such as car insurance and car payments, and drive unobstructed on public roads that were maintained in part with taxes i paid.however, i made some of the most horrific and detrimental decisions that i’ve ever made in my young life. after my college courses were over i began making the wrong friends. my cousin whom i lived with was dating a convicted felon who was on felony probation, and i was surrounding myself with people such as him and drug users. overtime, i chose to adapt to the environment consisting of negative activities as opposed to involving myself more with positive role models. i was an adult, and i should’ve known better than to be around the wrong people. i wound up committing a multitude of violent theft related felony offenses soon after i turned 19 years old. i thought that i was special and therefor exempt from the laws and social norms that society expects from its citizens. i believed that i wasn’t responsible for abusing illicit controlled substances, and i believed that i didn’t need to address some very prominent mental health related problems by continuing to attend therapy sessions that were provided free of charge by my community college.at 20 years old, i am a convicted felon. a thief. i no longer have my full ride scholarship, and my academic background has been disregarded and overshadowed by the newly adopted persona of a criminal. i am on a drug offender supervised release program for a period of over 5 years, of which i may not leave the county. my prospective university no longer will allow me to attend classes and they will not confer any type of degree to me. i am no longer a bright, kind, intelligent young man with prospects of obtaining a lucrative career path. i will not have easy access to gainful employment, as i’ve found that even small companies do not want to risk having a convicted thief on their payroll.at 20 years old, i may never vote again. i may not own or possess a firearm, ammunition or body armor. i may not own or possess any weapon during my supervised release. i may not make new meaningful connections through a post secondary institution, as i cannot go further than the aa degree i’ve earned. i will never get to experience the joys of freedom, all because i abused my freedom to deprive others to their right to own property.the judge informed me that one of the victims called me a “menace to society.” i am in no position to disagree. a menace is an unwanted cancer on the body of society, one that must be removed and terminated. at just 20 years old, i will be doing the right thing for society. i will be ending my life. i will provide closure for the victims of my thefts by ending my life, as they’ll never have to worry about me potentially reoffending ever again. i will save money for the tax payers and family whom i burdened with legal fees, probation fees, and other fees since i can’t locate gainful employment any longer.i want this to be a warning to any of you who thinks it pays to be a thief. if you believe that just because you have an education and you’re a white male that you can just violate the law as blatantly as i have, think again. if you think a crime spree or drug use is “fun,” think long and hard about the long lasting ramifications that your actions can and will have on the lives of others. i want to apologize to my victims, family and friends for my sins. i want to apologize to the police and the state for the extreme cost of investigation, and i’d like to apologize to the school system for investing so much time and effort into a prospect who chose to turn into dangerous liability. my suicide symbolizes regret. it symbolizes shame, and it symbolizes punishment. i believe the self imposition of a sentence of death is fair and not cruel or unusual given the circumstance of my crimes. despite nobody being injured, assaulted or otherwise directly involved during the commission of my criminal activities, a homeowner could’ve been fatally injured or otherwise harmed had they come outside during my deviant actions. because i knowingly and willingly committed these offenses while under the influence of illegal narcotics, i find it improbable and unlikely that my life holds any continued value.i am eternally ashamed and apologetic for becoming a reckless, unstable monster by abusing my freedom to become a danger to myself and others within the community. it is absolutely unacceptable to live this life knowing that what i’ve done could’ve resulted in great bodily injury or death. it is a constitutional right in the united states to be able to own and possess property, and i deprived and violated multiple victims of that right. therefor, i find it reasonable and with probable cause to discontinue the remainder of my existence due to me exhibiting an

4824,"i finish my philosophy masters in a couple days and i'm procrastinating. mostly thinking out loud; feel free to comment and engage if you want. i was on a gaming forum a day or so before and there was a debate about whether the next persona game should feature an ""aged up"" cast (young adults instead of teenagers). a couple posters were against it citing that it would be taking something away from the next generation of teenagers. i don't have much to say about the persona franchise specifically but it got me thinking about how so much media (both classic and current) resolves around the experience of being a teenager and those problems. there seems to be very little media about 20-25 year olds and that experience. maybe my teenagerhood was uncommonly easy but i find the difficulties of middle/high school overrated and the difficulties of the mid 20 period underrated.back to my previous comment, i was a ""nerd"" in high school but never bullied for it. hell, everyone in my school was a nerd. we all played pokemon, d&amp;d, halo, etc. the jocks, prom queens, everyone. perhaps i am a beneficiary of the time where nerd culture became more and more mainstream. i had good friends. i got good grades without studying. there was no teenage angst. no trying to ""find who i was."" perhaps this is because the basic building blocks of my identity were set fairly early as i've always had a strong sense of self. after i graduated college i moved halfway across the country on my own to start graduate school. at first i was very excited and i still believe it was the right choice. this gave way to a sense of loneliness that i believe can be typical of the post-college period. firmly separating yourself from day to day life with your family, starting a career, trying to make friends/find a significant other without the structure of school/college, finding one's place in the world,   dealing with the loneliness that can often come with all that: that is what seems to define early adulthood. identity seems to be a particularly interesting question/problem. in contrast with the, what seems to me, mostly superficial identity discovering/exploring that teenagers tend to do the young adult faces a more fundamental question: what kind of being do i want to be in this world? what career will i have, who do i want to spend the rest of my life with, do i want kids? the angst, uncertainty, excitement, and  questioning around those questions seem to pose different and more interesting conundrums. which leads back to what prompted this in the first place. it seems strange that there is so little media targeted towards and about 22-28 year olds. there is the potential for interesting stories, new tropes, freshness. there is a opportunity to tell deeper, more original, more thought provoking stories. i'll finish with a question and maybe we can share some recommendations. what media do you know of that tend to be about and for 20 somethings. i, for example, like the anime ""golden time"" for many of the reasons i discussed above. making it about college students gives it a different atmosphere, evokes different emotions, and allows it to avoid certain tropes. not to mention the last half of the final episode is so good (i cry everytime). the characters have more depth. they are more mature. they can say and do things that make them feel more like real people. it can end with an actual marriage proposal that doesn't feel weird as opposed to the nebulous ""well, i guess we're together now type relationships"" that seem to characterize teenage romantic fiction.  as an anime it draws a particularly stark contrast as about 95% of animes take place in high schools. i have also heard the manga and now manga ""sing yesterday for me"" is good at portraying the period right after college but i have not read it yet so cannot vouch for that. another favorite of mine is the anime, manga, and light novel ""spice and wolf."" the mix of medieval fantasy, economics, and a simple romance is very interesting. however, because the romance is between a 25 year old and a early 20ish year old (she's technically thousands of years old but physically and mentally 22-23) the romance takes on a different flavor. they are less awkward, more confidence, flirty, and more playful. somewhat paradoxically it seems that young adult targeted romances have less sex, focus on looks, and ""eye candy"" then teenage targeted romances. one of the most striking lines of dialogue to me is holo's ""i'm tired of being alone."" i watched the anime first so you might think it's less striking in the manga or light novel but it's just as powerful in the manga and light novel. one of the main themes of the story is the loneliness that young-youngish adults often face. that theme shines brightest in the original light novel and it somewhat lost in its adaption but is still definitely there in the anime and manga. tldr: do you think there's a shortage of media about and for young adults? why might be this be? what are some of your favorite pieces of media for and about young adults?",5,1,Thoughts about Media targeted towards Adults and the early-Mid 20 period in general,Adult

5634,"the only thing that will ever ruin your ability to function as a person is drugs and the commission of crimes. if you love yourself and you enjoy being alive, do not do these things. if you feel depressed or suicidal then get help. make friends. join clubs. talk to counselors. but don’t turn to drugs like i did, and don’t make friends with your dealer. don’t substitute “free time” with criminal actions that later on diminish your life.i went from a smart kid with a bright future to a useless liability. i had a full ride, guaranteed college admission and a future career in law enforcement. i threw it all away. i replaced my full ride with a $5000 bond. i replaced my future with a potential life sentence, which i’m facing next week. don’t ruin your life guys, just because you don’t feel alive doesn’t excuse deviant behavior or abuse of a controlled substance. i erased myself in one night. i’m committing suicide shortly to finish what i started the night i ended my life.do what’s right and don’t stray, people need you! just know that once you’re a felon then you aren’t ever a useful or required individual, and nobody will care if you’re sad. hell i’m shooting myself and i know if i fuck up and live i’ll get arrested for illegal possession of an ar15 that i haven’t given up to police yet. imagine being in that dark of a place because you wanted to do drugs? imagine replacing your dorm with a jail cell? imagine caring about being a person with goals and a future one moment but the next all you’re focused on is your suicide?please don’t be like me. it can happen to literally anybody, but please don’t let it happen to you. don’t abuse xanax or alcohol or any hard drugs and do not steal shit because it’s “fun.” studying is fun! achieving good grades is fun! having a great career is fun! but felonies and suicide are permanent and they invalidate you. don’t be like me guys. i’ll see you all in the next life and i promise that one will never have felonies.",1,2,Don’t EVER take your life for granted,Adult

5999,"i'm a well educated person, speaking four languages, having 7 years of experience in commercial photography, 5 years at television program production and am currently at university, learning graphic design, defering a yaar because of the pandemic.before i moved to the uk from hungary for uni last year, i was working at an ikea restaurant as a college/high scholl or whatever (9th to 13th grade school) student for one and half years after having had my internship at the television station, and while being a well booked, demandful photographer because i needed every penny to be able to move to the uk without my parents' support.i liked working at ikea as a student, three days a week, (30 hours). i loved the people, the atmosphere and having a close bond group i can work with. i was well appreciated and people liked the way i work.i quickly became a front of house cook without any former food industry experience, and absolutely no ambitions in catering but i was hgad they trusted me this much. it's a rare thing to get this position as a student.i moved to the uk after 1,5 years at ikea and after a year spent there i had to move back to hungary. this brings me to this year.i'm currently back at ikea for my 5th month since coming home. i'm front of house cook again and currently getting trained for new positions. i've been employee of the month, my pay is okay and i still love my co-workers.and they still appreciate my work and are extremely chuffed that i'm back.however.....i hate the food industry. i always felt like it might not be my thing but now i'm sure as hell that i have nothing to do with food preparation and cooking for 10k people a day.....i feel like burning out.i haven't had much luck in the creative field lately either. the thing is tho that i like my jobmates way too much to leave them and i never felt this important before. i was never of this much respect anywhere. i have trained newcomers, i reached milestones that others had to work several more years for.i take pride on all kinds of work i'm doing no matter how much i want to be in the field or not. work is work and i'm doing my best regardless. and they know it, and they appreciate it.i don't know whether i should change jobs, look for something new because even if i find a better opportunity as a creative practician i feel like i will miss my co-workers too much and i won't be treated  this well and trusted this much again.especially that i'm only staying i  hungary for 10 more months before moving back to the uk.should i stay at ikea doing my best for 10 months, finish uni, and find a job in my field after i finally have my papers and proper certificates?or should i say yolo, find something and care about money and relevnat experience, rather than the atmosphere?again, i'm 21 and i have 10 months till i move countries so this is not a post about long term choices.thanks if you read it through. i know it's a lot.i hope you a have an amazing day!",0,1,Should I change my job?

6027,"hi there! my name is rose. i’m 22 years old, just graduated college 2 months ago. i have started my own successful business from scratch and so far so good in terms of “income.” however, i want to use my degree, because i love what i studied. here’s the problem.i can’t find a job in my state, it’s been hard but i’ve gotten many many opportunities/offers all over the us. so what’s the problem? i’m nervous, anxious, i feel lost. i have zero friends, my dumped me a year ago, i live with family for now and well, i’m just scared.scared to see what’s out there and i was never like this. i have always wanted to explore the world and just take it by the balls. but now that the job offer is on the table, and i would have to move across the country for a job, without knowing anyone, finding a place to stay, etc. it’s so much to handle, i know i can do it but something about moving across the country for a job alone scares me. i guess because i had my life planned out with my ex.. where we were going to move in together, and travel for a job if we needed to.. i just feel so lost.. i don’t want to reject any jobs/and i won’t, but i need some assurance that i’ll be okay.. that i’ll be happy..",1,1,Advice about a Job/Life,Adult
