Whether it’s from home or from the dorms into off campus housing there are few things you should know about renting an apartment or house. 

**Basics**

* The monthly cost to live not just the rental price. That is the baseline. The true cost is is rent + internet/cable + electricity + water + heat +...+…+… Your monthly budget should account for all of these expenses. Some properties include some or all utilities, others do not. Factor that in when comparing rental costs. You can ask the utility what the average monthly bill at your address was in previous years when you sign up to get an idea of the cost.

* Most landlords insist that all tenants sign the same lease. This makes you and your friends/frenemies/randos you find through Craigslist collectively responsible for the full rental amount. If your roommate can’t pay on time you still owe the full amount. 

* You are all collectively responsible for damage to the property. The landlord is not a judge and doesn’t care who broke the shelf in the kitchen. They only care about the broken shelf. You will have to reach an agreement with your roommates – ideally before anything happens – about how damage deposits will be handled in the event they are assessed. 

* Read the lease. Focus on the “End of Tenancy” section. Most leases require that you give notice 30 or more days before the end of the lease if you do not intend to continue renting. If you do not give this notice many leases anticipate switching over to month-to-month tenancy. The Landlord will not assume that you plan to move out and you may end up paying for one or more extra months of occupancy because you did not follow the lease. 

* Read the lease again. Focus on the “Notice” section. You will note that it does not list the Landlord’s telephone number. This means that for the purposes of moving out, or disputing something, or otherwise complying formally with the terms of the lease you will be required to do what is described there – usually either first class mail or less frequently email. You may have a tradition of contacting the landlord via phone - but if the issue comes before a court of law you want proof that you complied with the notice section. 

* Avoid if at all possible any arrangement that results in you paying rent in cash or by money order. Neither of those generate records. If you have to pay by either of those methods insist on a written receipt each month and keep it. 

**Roommates**

* Choose wisely. Your BFF from High School might or might not be a bad choice. Was she always borrowing money from people? Probably not a good sign. It's better to share a place with a responsible person who is no fun than a fun person who isn't responsible. 

* You are in this together. If you wouldn't trust them holding $5-10,000 of your money in their hands for a week - then it probably wouldn't be a good idea to rent with them - because that's the amount of power they have over you. 

* Trust, but verify. If you give money to your roommate who then pays the Landlord, ask for a copy of the check. Many people get screwed over when they've been paying rent the whole time but it's been used to finance roomie's partying. If the option exists - always use personal checks to the landlord, that way you have proof in the form of bank records that the rent was paid.  


**Moving in &amp; out**

* Make sure to do a walkthrough of the apartment with the landlord or their agent prior to occupancy. Note all damage and wear. Take photographs of everything and save copies somewhere other than your phone. This is not the time to be polite and not mention a scuff. Keep a copy of the damage walkthrough, don’t rely on the landlord to keep records. 

* Don’t plan to move out the last day of your lease. Give yourself time to have a clean apartment. Plan to do the walkthrough with all roommates present, and have your copy of the report from the day you moved in. 

* Read the rules in your jurisdiction as they relate to return of damage deposits. Be wary. Do not let the Landlord charge you for normal wear and tear. Almost every city/state has laws requiring the money to be either returned or the reasons for retention explained within a certain period after you surrender occupancy. Familiarize yourself with those laws. 

**Evictions &amp; Breaking leases**

* You never want an eviction on your record. They follow you around like a scarlet letter. Your next landlord will not care that you were evicted because your roommate was “a dick” who didn’t pay his rent. Don’t get in that situation.

* You cannot kick your roommate out. They cannot kick you out. Only the Landlord can evict you. This includes when your roommate is your spouse or girl/boyfriend. It doesn't matter that they slept with that slut Gina. 

* Do not get screwed by a roommate. This means make sure to get proof that the rent has been paid each and every month if they are remotely shady. If they stop paying, you could be evicted even though you are current. 

* If you can't pay rent try to negotiate a way out that doesn't result in an eviction. Most Landlords are reasonable. They're in it for the money, not the thrill of taking people to court. 

* If you need to break the lease - expect to pay. In certain cities like San Francisco or Seattle someone will be waiting to snap up your lease on a moment's notice. That isn't true everywhere. Be prepared to make an offer to the landlord to let you out early

**Rent Abatement**

* You cannot choose to not pay rent if the landlord doesn’t fix something as a way of spurring them to action. Mostly. There are a few limited exceptions that are *specified in the laws of your state* - look them up. Even then they require action within a limited period of time once the landlord is notified. Remember “notification” means something different in leases than in real life. That often means you need to mail something to the landlord at the official address.

* If it is something small, like ants – just put on your adult pants and go to the store and buy ant baits. Don’t waste the landlord’s time and (more importantly) their good will on small issues. Same with lightbulbs and batteries for the smoke detectors. You can’t withhold rent on these issues.  

**Utilities**

* You will probably have to sign up for one or more utility services. Make sure to terminate them on move out. This is doubly true if you move out but some of your roommates are staying on. Everybody has a horror story of a friend that never changed the electric bill and had to spend time trying to collect from the next set of tenants who moved in. Don't be the source of the next round of those stories - just be the person who laughs at them.

* Have a plan to budget and pay for these. Some are billed monthly, others bi-monthly. Keep a separate account at your bank if you have trouble keeping money in your main debit account. 

**Sub-leases**

* If you can avoid doing this, avoid it. 

* If you have to get a sublessee try to get the landlord to agree to have them take over your lease, rather than you acting as a jr. landlord. It’s worth $20-$50 per month remaining on the contract, at a minimum – so if there are six months remaining offer the landlord $300 cash to re-write the lease now. You get out with your security deposit and no headaches. 

* If your only option is to have a sublease then do a walk through with them, get the damage deposit from them, and in all other ways behave as if you are a landlord. You do not want to be on the hook for thousands of dollars because of damage they cause. Protect yourself. 

* If you are going to be sub-leasing then treat the person you are leasing from as a landlord and follow the steps listed here. 

**Pets**

* If the building is no pets – then don’t bring a pet. Don’t try to get a doctor to write you a prescription for an emotional service animal so you can get around it. Don't be that guy. Really you shouldn't even be friends with that guy. He's a dick.  

* If your lease requires a pet deposit, pay it. If there is a requirement for extra rent each month for a pet, pay that too. Don’t try to scam your landlord. 

**Renter’s Insurance**

* This is a 100% must have. 

* Get as much as you can. It costs almost nothing. It will protect you in all kinds of situations. If you are robbed, water damage, someone injured, or any of dozens other possible eventualities it will help you. 

* You can probably get it through the same people that do your car insurance. 

**Big Picture**

* Your relationship with your landlord is important. They can be your best ally or your worst nightmare. But think of them like you think of the Police. Ideally you have no interaction - but when you do it's because they are providing you with a service not responding because you screwed up somehow. Don't call them over stupid issues that you can handle. 

* It's not Black Mold. Yeah, I know it's black and it's mold. It's not Black Mold, however. 99% of the time you can clean it with a sponge and some disinfectant. 

It’s kind of intimidating, but all of this is actually easy. Good luck in your new place. ",Adulting101,[101] Leases and Roommates 101,

In this 101, we'll talk about the very least you need to buy for your kitchen.   This assumes that you have nothing and that you are the one doing the buying.  It also assumes you don't have more than three roommates who will be sharing the kitchen with you.

This also assumes that you will be doing some (at least minimal) kind of cooking or meal preparation -- at least eggs, tacos, pasta, that sort of thing.  We'll talk more about cooking and how to learn to do it in the future, but for now, let's start with equipping a basic, economical kitchen with the very basics.  You can do this on a budget of $225-$250 or so, maybe less if you are clever with coupons and sales.

(Note:  My links are to Amazon because I do a lot of shopping there and I know how to find things quickly.  You can find equivalent items for similar prices at stores like Target, Walmart, etc.   And I use Amazon Smile because it's nice to donate to charity!  Choose your own when you log in for the first time.)  

**Dishware**:

The first thing you'll need are some dishes; big ones, small ones, bowls.  You don't need anything fancy here.  A basic service for four can be had [here](https://smile.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-16-Piece-Dinnerware-Set-Service/dp/B0157FD02C) for as low as $28.  That includes big and small plates, coffee cups, and bowls you can use for salads or cereal.  What you want to look for is something reasonably durable and lightweight.  
I also recommend a service for four for up to four people for the simple reason that it will prevent dishes from piling up!

**Flatware (aka utensils):**

Again, you don't need anything fancy for your first place.  [This] (https://smile.amazon.com/Cambridge-Silversmiths-Cortney-Flatware-Stainless/dp/B01M4IC92J/) service for four has 20 pieces, and will fit your needs.

You'll also need a decent set of knives] (https://smile.amazon.com/Ikea-Steak-Knives-Stainless-Steel/dp/B00OAC21CY/)  if you plan to cut anything more than butter.  

**Glassware:**

Coffee cups are covered in your dishware purchase, so you really only need some clear drinking glasses.  This set has [4 of each](https://smile.amazon.com/Home-Essentials-KS-6RRC-G604-Galaxy-Glassware/dp/B000NSIF9C/) of three different sizes.  They can double as stemless wine glasses or cocktail glasses.  If you want something you can take outside, consider acrylic or durable plastic instead of glass.

**Serving Dishes:**

If you are living alone, you may not need any serving dishes or utensils to start -- if you have an occasional guest your regular dishes can serve double duty.  

If you have roommates, though, you might want to consider adding a few serving dishes like [this one] (https://smile.amazon.com/Corelle-Livingware-4-Inch-Serving-Platter/dp/B0000CFTDW/) in different shapes and sizes.  One bowl and one rectangular-shaped dish will probably do.   

**Things for Cooking:**

Sets really come in handy here.  You may end up with a few more things than you really need, but you will still pay less than you would for individual pieces.
A set like [this one] (https://smile.amazon.com/25-Piece-Kitchen-Utensils-Cooking-Stainless/dp/B01J93TQYY/) includes most of the basics you need for cooking and serving.  It has spoons for cooking and serving, a peeler, a manual can opener, a corkscrew, measuring cups and spoons, etc.  Eventually you may want to get fancier versions of some of these, but for now, this will do, all for about $20.   The only thing I think this set is missing is a [set of wooden spoons](https://smile.amazon.com/Chef-Craft-Maple-Wooden-Spoon/dp/B003EI4OHU/) and maybe some kind of jar to keep everything in on your counter, unless you have the drawer space.

A [basic bakeware set](https://smile.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-BK-D5045C-6-Piece-Bakeware-Set/dp/B00XBC3O8Y/)  is for more than just cookies. You can use it to broil chicken, steak or vegetables, bake homemade mac and cheese, and do a lot of other simple, oven-centric cooking.  Oh, and I'll teach you how to make the best chocolate chip cookies in the universe in a future 101.  With any bakeware, from this inexpensive set to the best you can buy, you want durable and easy to clean.

Basic cookware, meaning at least [one good size skillet](https://smile.amazon.com/Farberware-Dishwasher-Performance-Nonstick-12-Inch/dp/B0095PRPT0/) and [one good size saucepan](https://smile.amazon.com/Quart-Nonstick-Saucepan-Glass-Lid/dp/B01G26Z3P2/).   

For not much more money you can get a quite good [set like this one] (https://smile.amazon.com/T-fal-Signature-Thermo-Spot-Indicator-Dishwasher/dp/B001167VIQ/)  with a lot more stuff in it.  If you can afford it and if you have the storage space, a set like that will last you for years.  (I use a slightly higher-end version of the same brand in my kitchen.)  

A collander or strainer.  I like the look of [this set](https://smile.amazon.com/Colander-Set-Collapsible-Colanders-Strainers/dp/B00L3QWJBI) for the variety of sizes and ease of cleaning.  You will need this for pasta and anything else that might need draining or straining.  

A cutting board [or set of them](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B002M782UO/), because if you don't use a cutting board you won't be getting your security deposit back.
You will need [a couple of potholders and kitchen towels] (https://smile.amazon.com/Topaz-Kitchen-Towel-Set-Piece/dp/B01EVMPF3O/).

One good chef's knife.  I'm not including a link here, because I want you to go shopping at a store for this item.  Bed Bath &amp; Beyond or a similar place is a good choice for this, but anywhere with a decent selection with a broad price range will do.   You will want to spend a little more money on this, maybe $30-$50, to get something that will last for awhile.  Look for an eight inch blade.  Pick the knife up, see how it feels in your hand, and take your time.  This is an important purchase.

Eventually, I’ll cover a bunch of topics having to do with renting.  This post in particular talks about what to do *before* you start looking for your first place on your own.

#What to look at before renting your first place 

There are many things that often get overlooked when you’re first moving out on your own.  Everyone knows that they need to plan for rent, but they don’t know how much they should be spending or how much to save for other things.  This post, mostly based on my own experience, will hopefully help you figure some of those things out.

----

1\. **How much money do you make?**

The first thing, before even deciding whether you’re going to live alone or with a roommate, is to make sure you know how much money you actually make.  A lot of people don’t pay enough attention to this, and end up renting more apartment than they can afford.  

More than just knowing how much you make per hour, you want to know how much you make each month.  Take a look at the last month’s worth of paystubs, and see how much you made after taxes, insurance, etc.

This number isn’t how much you can afford to spend on rent.  Realistically, you want to spend no more than 30% of this number on rent.  So if you’re making $1,000 each month, you want to find somewhere to rent that’s under $300/month.  There may be some fudging on this depending on where you live.  My advice, shoot for 20% if you can.  It’s your first place, it doesn’t need to be the best place you’ve ever seen.  

----

2\. **How much do places in your area cost to rent?**

Now that you know how much you can spend on rent, start looking at what places generally go for in your area.  Keep in mind that you’re not actually apartment shopping yet!  You’re just getting an idea for what the local market is like.  

Look on Craigslist, look at the classifieds for your local newspaper, find any source you can for rental listings.  Check nice neighborhoods, check bad neighborhoods, look at one bedrooms, two bedrooms, houses, apartments.  Basically check everything you can so you have a good idea of what the going rate is going to be.

Once you’ve got that in mind, take a look at your budget again.  Did you find any one bedroom places around that 20% goal?  If no, how about 30%?  If you didn’t find anything under the 30% mark, then you’re going to have to consider roommates or looking in a different area.  

----

3\.	**How much do you have in savings/checking?**

When you actually go to sign the lease, you’re going to need to have more than just the monthly rent available to give to your landlord.  So before you start actually looking at places, you want to make sure you have enough cushion to get into your new place.

It’s not uncommon for a landlord to require first &amp; last month’s rent plus a deposit before you can move in.  When I’ve rented, I’ve also had it be just first month plus a deposit.  The deposit is often the same amount as your monthly rent, but it can be less or more depending on a number of factors.  So while you’re going through the planning and preparation phase, if you’re looking at rent of $200/month, plan on having $600 to be able to move in.  This should be in excess of any other expenses you’re going to have (food, utilities, etc.).   Don’t expect to build up $600 in your checking account and then spend it all on moving in, leaving yourself with nothing.

While you’re building up this move in amount, figure out which companies provide power, gas, and internet in your area.  Many times when you’re renting, these will be included in your rent, but you want to be prepared in case they aren’t.  Take a look at their websites and see if they charge a deposit to start service.  If it’s not on their website, give them a quick call and ask.  Also, see if the gas or power websites have a calculator to estimate monthly costs so that you can figure it into your budget.

----

4\.	**Don’t forget to factor in other things**

There are still other things that you’re going to need.  Toilet paper, food, linens, etc.  It’s all going to be pretty individualized to what you personally use, so it’s hard to set a guideline for how much you should factor in to your budget.

A good starting place is $50/week/person, but like most things, this could change based on where you are and the local prices.  Your first shopping trip when you move is going to be more, though, because you’re going to be buying things like trash cans and cleaning supplies.  So what I’m going to recommend is half of what your monthly rent is should be budgeted for your first shopping trip.  This doesn’t include things like furniture, which I’ll get into in the next part of your series.  This is for food, utensils, cleaning supplies, toilet paper, trash cans, towels, etc.  Seriously, don’t forget the toilet paper.  Whatever you don’t spend on this trip can be either put into savings or used to get some fun stuff to celebrate your first place!

----

5\.	**Start looking for an actual place!**

By this point, you now know how much you make, how much you’re going to save up, whether or not you’re going to have a roommate, and a general idea for the areas you’re going to look for a place in.  Now comes the fun part, where you actually go out and look at places!

But that’s going to be in the next part of my series!  Stay tuned!

* How do you file your taxes? 

* How do you handle workplace conflicts?

* How do you know if that apartment is a good deal, or a nightmare waiting to happen? 

* How do you buy a car?

* How do you plan a budget?

* What do I need to buy for my first kitchen?

* Get a CarFax report. Yeah, a CarFax report costs money, but it costs much less money than you'll be spending on fixing the crappy car you'll get if you don't get a CarFax report.

* At least use CarFax's free odometer check. If you enter a VIN, it'll send you a report on whether there's an odometer discrepancy. It won't give any more details unless you pay, but that should be enough right there to stay away from the car. https://www.carfax.com/press/resources/odometer

* Speaking of odometers, it's not hard to ""rollback"" odometers, even on newer cars and cars with digital odometers. Be wary of older cars advertised at a low mileage. What's normal might depend on your area (how much people tend to drive where you live), but if someone in Los Angeles is advertising a 2001 Honda Accord at 70,000 miles, you might want to be careful.

* Most used car sales are ""as is."" If you buy a car that dies on you the next day, you have no recourse unless you can prove that the seller knew about issues and didn't disclose those issues. The key word in that last sentence is ""prove.""

* Make sure you do any required paperwork for your state (transfer paperwork, transfer of title, etc.). Do this before the car changes hands.

* Check the name/address on the title against the ID of the person selling you the car. If a private party is selling you a car that isn't in his/her name, something isn't right. No one likes dealing with the DMV under normal circumstances. Imagine dealing with them when there are issues with the transfer. Also, feel free to Google Map the address to make sure it's real.

* Take a picture of the seller and his/her ID card or driver license. They might get weirded out, but just explain it is for your protection. If they won't allow it, they're probably doing something shady. Remember, we can't do anything if you met some dude at Target and have no idea what his real name is. You have the phone number? Yeah, it's a burner phone.

* Retain documentation, at least until you're pretty comfortable the car is what you thought it was. Print/screenshot the advertisement (i.e. Craigslist), any texts with the seller. etc.

I say thing information to help others better give advice

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND:
My parents are divorced and both have been very abusive in their own way.a my mother has full costody and I will probably review no money from my disabled father who is in the clutches of his family that's probably liquidating his assets. My mother has been reported to DCF before and I've tried to get help with my situation before, but considering I have my own problems, and I showed no signs of bruising from times she's hit me, and I haven't shown anyone the unconsented video footage of her vocal emotional abuse DCF did not remove me***. She ""saves"" my pay checks because she doesn't let me have them. And I pay some bills because we're low income. 

I need to leave because I'm tired of having the environment on me
Some rules of hers include: 

-no sleeping over girl friends houses even though I have when I was younger
-no hanging out with guys unless you're in a group setting and must be even mix gender or mostly female
-no hanging out with taken guys in relationships
-no hanging out with guys if you're in a relationship (I'm only allowed straight relationships. If I came out as pan she would disown me and send me to the hospital she thinks being not straight is a mental problem)
-no being out after 9 but really your curfew is 8:30
-no friends even if they're off their JOL cannot drive you it must be my mom or another trusted adult of a friend's parent

-------------------------------------------------------------

MY MOM HERSELF:
Racist- has been toward me because I'm Chinese and she's Italian. She adopted me and has said racist things toward me as well as thinking theres problems with every race that's not hire or anyone of color that's not a doctor or lawyer

Sexist- until she learned females can make money in science fields she didn't want me doing anything like it. She made me not take woodshop for example because she was also afraid of the guys
She also doesn't think having friends that aren't females is dlwrkng and not possible

Lgbtq+ phobic- anyone that's not cis gendered and straight to her she thinks has some medical issue like it's a disability and a mental health problem and needs to be punished. (I'm pansexual and questioning if I'm agender or genderqueer)

Other prejudices-
-Thinking people can reade her mind
-Any one in customer service is stupid/ she can be rude and expect they'll still be nice
-Everyone wants the best for her
-shell do good for you and expect she can treat you like shit later but it's okay because she did something for you that you never needed or asked for (I get it's nice but ie: buying say a coffee and then saying something like Im a burden in her life)

Other problems:
-thinking I make her yell and get angry and upset when she does it to herself because she's very opinionated and I don't have control over say the guy pumping our gas or that I say forgot something that was her responsibility like not missing a gas station she passes while driving 

-she is financially abusive because I can't even keep ahold of my own money without her threatening me in the way of say not letting me see my friends*

*I need to see my friends because I need a break from being at home. I've gotten so depressed from not seeing them before they've become one of the only things that keeps me afloat

 Abuse
-verbally abusive and things she says is scary: ""all liars should die"" ""when you and (her bf) are sick next I'll fucking 'chicken soup you' and then you'll croak"" ""do you blow your bf with that mouth"" ""you're a fucking whore"" (I broke up with one bf and four months later found someone else I wanted to date) 
That also ties into  emotional abuse
- she guilt trips me all the time and says she can do things because she's an adult even if it's ridiculous
- physical abuse: she says away from this because she's been physically beaten belt style when young but she has still whipped a belt at me before, grabbed me, pulled my hair, slapped me with a metal ruler and threatened me in various ways including to crash a car while we're in it. Nothing has been enough to leave a scar and mostly just to sting and be red for a bit
 ---also physically abusive to my things like destroying a 150$ tablet that was my last Christmas gift from my father who is too disabled to know what time of day it is or what 1 plus 1 is
Destroyed a government provided trac phone (bc low income)
Destroyed another phone (150$) that was a gift to me
 *** I can't have any privacy she if she wants to needs to be able to read through my texts and I can't have social media without her knowing (so she doesn't know about this account) because she'd want me to explain everything but do the adult thing where she doesn't actually listen and expect me to keep answering the same question. She'd question why I post anything or who people are and want to control everything 

- parenting is basically from the 50's like anything that happens in the house stays in the house (even if you want to kill yourself which I have because if this environment)
- therapy is for insane people
- mental health doesn't exist you're either okay and sane or you have a illegal problem that needs to be locked up (but it's okay for her to have anxiety which no one can say she has just her or shell tell at you)

-bizzare weird things that just make me uncomfortable: she think she can just into the bathroom when I'm taking a piss or a shower even if I'm naked and want privacy 
-she will go to the bathroom if I'm say washing my face even though we have a second one 
-she keep telling at me to get out if the bathroom because she needs to go even if I do even though we have a second one
-shell just be naked like say after a shower and say I'm in the bathroom doing something even though it's not a sight I want to see without warning
-she pushes her way into all my doctors and everything appointments and doesn't understand no matter how many times people tell her what patients rights are and I have to have my doctors and what not just straight up lie to her it's that bad

I've sprinkled examples of her weirdness and how she's abusive and controlling and unsupportive.

-------------------------------------------------------------

***SOME THINGS ABOUT ME:
I have depression and anxiety that have been clinical and even lead me to emergency services and therapy. I have indulged in self harm and binge drinking as a suicide attempt

This ties into why DCF didn't remove me because they couldn't see past the cutting and drinking even though I'd tell them why. 

This isn't all my problems but it strongly ties into my concerns and why I posted this:

Because of my legal history for stealing from my house and consumption of alcohol and past mental health outburst (going on 4 years ago) does this affect when I turn eighteen to go and not had my parents know anything. 
I plan on not signing anyway medial rights besides if I'm not able to give consent to medical procedures if I say get in a car crash and need surgery but can't respond. I won't give them financial power either. 

I need to know what I should do when I'm eighteen like how to get medical insurance

I only work part time and make Massachusetts minimum wage for 12 hours with a week's pay of 149$

I do not have my lisence just a permit
Obviously no car

I don't want to burden my friends parents too much even though I might stay with someone for a bit.
--she would literally call all my friends and their parents and the police department when I'm eighteen as if they could do something about getting me back in the house

I'm currently 17 turning eighteen in June just after high school graduation

Planning on going to college for four years

I'm mentally stable now despite my disorders

I need to get out of my house if possible on the day I'm eighteen

Some complications include: 
-not having a car or licence
-not having a lot of money 
-no siblings 
-no family to take me in
-going to college soon
-place to live/storage
-i am adopted and the most official document I have is going to be my passport coming in. We had to give up my permanent resident card to give the okay that I'm actually a citizen (American parents adopting foreign children on touch her down of the plane in America = USA citizen but we had no official document )
(I'd need to steal all my papers that I don't know where all of them are in the house)

These apps have helped make adulthood easier for me and I wanted to share them with you. Thank me later!

1) Doctor on Demand 
What it is: 24 hour online medical care for common ailments. They have video mental health counseling from psychologists/psychiatrists available too.
How I discovered them: I got a UTI on vacation and couldn’t get off the toilet to sit in a waiting room just to get a prescription for antibiotics. So I did a quick google search for “online doctor uti” and the app and several other similar ones came up. 
How it can be beneficial to you: No PTO to see a doctor for a common ailment/concern? Doctor on Demand. On vacation? Doctor on Demand. Mental health counseling without leaving your home? DOD. For real. 

2) Acorns
What it is: Automatic savings/low risk investment app for beginners 
How I discovered it: my friend told me about it
How it can be beneficial to you: I have it set up so it transfers $20 a day and rounds up my purchases to the nearest dollar. I recently saved up over $1k in a span of less than two months. Key: wait to pull your money out when you’ve made gains and let it sit through losses unless you really need it of course. 

3) Tasty app for cooking 
How I discovered it: I follow tasty on IG
How I use it: easiest to use recipe platform in my opinion. Complete with videos and guides. Ranging from “4 ingredient recipes, one pan meals, deserts and more elaborate things like how to make a thanksgiving turkey.

4) My Mechanic 
How I discovered it: haven’t had car trouble in 4 years. My car wouldn’t turn on after being away on vacation for a week. Did a quick google search for “mobile mechanic + my city” and it popped up. Someone is coming to take a look at the car on Monday and will provide me with an estimate on what it will be to repair it on the spot. 

5) Honk roadside assistance
How I discovered it: my ex had an older car with basic liability insurance on it so he didn’t have AAA or roadside assistance available from his insurance. After we tried jump starting the car with cables to no avail, we knew we needed to get the car out of that restaurant parking lot so I did a google search for roadside assistance apps and honk came up. They towed the car to auto zone safely for $70 and they even called to check up on us if everything was ok and ask if we would need more assistance.

So, my daughter (18yo) is living in a nice setup...in my basement.  Her and her 3 mo daughter (my beautiful, one and only, granddaughter) have been living for free for many months.  I have recently asked her to pay rent as she is not in school like she said she would do.  The deal was they live for free is she is in school, since she keeps putting it off (2 semesters now) I have asked her to start paying rent.  She says she is going to school in December and I told her she has to start paying in November but if she does, truly, start in December i will give her the November and December rents back.  Here are my questions:
--1. Is this fair?
--2. How much would you pay?
--3. Why does she cry so much when I talk to her about this?
She is working full-time (what I am asking for monetarily is less then 50% of one of her 2 pay checks a month).  She has no license and so is not paying any insurance or car payment.  Nor transportation as she is taken and picked up every day by her father (also in our home) which she pay nothing for.  The baby's father doesnt contribute but is around...this is not the issue so please no advise on him). 

 Just looking for the perspective of you youngins.  What do you think of this?  Are those of you living at home paying anything?  Does it seem extreme?  Do you resent your parents for asking you to pay?

If you actually get to know me in real life, I'm quite interesting in a crazy kind of way. I've been told most of my adult life that I'm very pretty. This was not the case until I graduated high school so I'm a girl with ""ugly duckling syndrome."" You know, the kind of girl that learns to be funny, sweet and likeable because they are ugly and they need some chance of survival in this cruel world. Luckily, I grew into my looks and have a fun demeanor to boot!

Anyways, I'm a recovering addict. When I talk about my previous drinking or wild lifestyle, it seems like it was a different person. My friends endearingly came up with a name for my alter ego whom expressed herself frequently after flirting with hard liquor and usually involved poor decision making skills. I've always had my mom's strong will and my dad's temper. I saw a post on Facebook the other day explaining that parents get mad at their children for being a younger exact version of themselves. I feel like that's true in my case. 

As a teenager, I had quite an attitude. I was told, ""These are the rules. If you don't like it, you can leave."" Bye. I left, moved into a studio apartment my friend was renting which was virtually a party house for these 17-20 year old punks that had nothing better to do with their lives. My parents had no way to reach me... pre-cellphone era. They had no idea where I went. After weeks of searching, I was found and my presence was requested to come home with more lieneant rules, of course. Bad idea on my parents part. Their love blinded them to most things involving their only daughter and her shenanigans. So, needless to say... NOTHING is EVER my fault. I'm always a victim of circumstances in my parents eyes. 

I also read on Facebook a post stating, ""Successful Adulting: Not stabbing someone when you really want to!"" There were a few comments of people tagging other people and a comment making a joke about not wanting to be an adult.  I commented on my friend's post, ""Apparently I failed adulting."" No one has commented on the post since. The truth of the matter is, I really did stab someone... because I really wanted to. Of course, an action like this doesn't come without consequences.  2 years supervised probation to be exact. Loss of my career path. Inability to find another job. The consequences were endless.... like a snowball effect. Fortunately, or unfortunately, depends on your point of view, the victim of my stabbing survived with only a few stitches and hurt feelings. He is still very involved in my life today. When we argue nowadays, I usually mumble, ""I should've aimed better."" Surprisingly, I was not on drugs or alcohol during that event either. Just pregnant and hormonal.  I laugh about the entire situation now to stop from crying. I do not advise anyone to follow that decision. 

So, today I found out that I officially failed Adulting from Facebook's point of view. Apparently, when people actually do have a history of stabbing a loved one and they make a joke on social media it creates that uncomfortable feeling of an elephant in the room and ceases further commentary. Surprisingly, I'm ok with my Failure of Adulting. There are many other things I do excel at and my poor decision makes for some really sick and sarcastic jokes with my closest friends so it all works out in the end

I am writing as a normal person who has bought insurance for houses and cars. Any experts are welcome to add on or post their own guide.

What you need

 - You need insurance for your car and your property (house or renters)

What to look for

For car insurance there are two types:

Liability - only covers your liability when you are responsible for the accident

Comprehensive - Covers you when you cause and accident and when someone hits your car

If you get liability, and someone hits you, your are going to be doing a lot of foot work to get made whole. And it may never happen. Comprehensive is always best unless you are driving a super cheap car and have the money saved to replace it. 

There are things you can add:

Uninsured motorist - this covers you if someone who has no insurance hits you. It doesnt cover you for a hit and run. You have to still know who hit you. 

GAP - this covers you for the difference between what your car is worth and what is left on your car. Cars are often upside down in their loans. They depreciate quickly. So if someone hits you and totals the car, you will only get what the car is worth and you will still owe the bank more money, for a car that doesnt exist. 

Renters insurance - this covers your stuff inside your rental and possibly garage (be sure to ask). It is cheap and highly recommended to have. 

Home owners insurance - required if you hold a loan/mortgage. And also helpful as it covers you if someone gets hurt on your property. 

You can generally get a discount if you bundle your insurance. 

Shop around. Rates are tricky and you can often get a better deal by shopping around. 

You can also save money if you are able to pay for a full year up front. 

Make sure you take pictures of your property (car, house, stuff) often. Once a year. So you can show what you own if you have to make a claim. Keep them off site and safe (in the cloud, with a friend, in a fire rated safe).

Make sure you keep your up to date insurance card in your car. Yes you can get them digitally but dont count on that being there when you need it or an officer accepting it. Just keep your paper copy. One in your wallet, one in your car.

At its most basic level a security deposit is money held in escrow (that is money placed in trust) as a sort of insurance against damage to property or failure to pay rent.  This money is still the tenant’s money, but is held for the benefit of the landlord.  The amount of a deposit that is allowed varies by locality, so you should always look to your state and local laws to see what amount of deposit a landlord is allowed to require.  The amount of a deposit required will vary by landlord, with large commercial landlords typically requiring a smaller deposit of a couple hundred dollars, while renting from individuals will often require one to two months’ rent as despot.  But again, this will vary by landlord and locality.
•	The most common dispute comes as to what a tenant can be charged for at the end of a lease.  As with everything else in this guide, it’s important to note that there may be state or local laws that modify these general rules, this is intended only as a basic guide.  

o	First, the tenant can be charged for things explicitly permitted by the lease.  For example, may landlords will allow a pet only with a non-refundable deposit of a couple hundred dollars.  This money is as the term non-refundable suggests, non-refundable.  This is typically used to cover carpet cleaning and other costs associated with the additional wear and tear that pets cause.  Of note here, requiring such an additional deposit for an emotional support animal DOES NOT run afoul of the Fair Housing Act.  Although the landlord might not be able to charge additional rent for an ESA, an additional deposit to cover the added wear and tear of an ESA is permissible.  Another similar clause that would be permissible in many states would be for smoking.  Depending on your situation there might be other clauses that would be inserted, so look to this first.

o	Second, a tenant cannot be charged for NORMAL wear and tear.  There is some gray area as to what constitutes normal wear and tear, but the most common place that this comes up is with carpets.  A tenant cannot be charged for the normal matting down and degradation of carpet that comes with living in a unit.  The expected useful life of a carpet will vary by the type of carpet installed, but the simple fact that the carpet doesn’t look exactly as it did the day a tenant moves in doesn’t mean there has been excessive wear and tear such that they can be charged for it.  Indeed, nearly every appliance or fixture in a rental has some sort of life expectancy, so the simple fact that something has to be replaced isn’t in and of itself evidence that the tenant can be charged, the age of the appliance or fixture being replaced has to be considered.

o	Holes in the wall.  Individual leases will set the exact parameters of what is allowed, but in general tenants are allowed to put up pictures and other small wall decorations and cannot be charged for those small holes.  However, as holes get bigger the tenant can be charged.  A big area of conflict here is with mounted TVs.  A TV mount typically requires above average sized screwed to ensure that the mount stays secure and the TV doesn’t fall down.  The repair of these holes is often the point at which a tenant can be required to cover the costs of repair.

o	 Another big issue is cleaning.  Again, this issue has a lot of gray area.  Leases typically require that units be returned in “broom clean” condition.  This doesn’t mean it has to be sparkling, but if there is trash or visible grime on fixtures tenants can be charged for the cost of cleaning that.  On the other hand, the fact that a landlord wipes the entire property down and vacuums it, wouldn’t in and of itself be evidence that the tenant could be charged for these activities.

o	Obvious damage.  The cost of any other obvious damage can be taken from the deposit.

o	Finally there is unpaid rent, at the end of a term if there is unpaid rent, with few exceptions, the deposit can be used to cover this rent.

•	Another common dispute is about how much a tenant can be required to pay for items that are damaged beyond normal wear and tear.  

o	People often look to depreciation charts to argue that tenants cannot be required to pay for damage to older carpets. But depreciation is just an accounting tool. Many assets that have been depreciated to a value of $0 still have a useful life and as such you can be required to pay for damage to those items. So the question is this, due to normal wear and tear did the item in question already need to be replaced? If not the tenant is going to be on the hook for replacement.

o	The fact that the tenant is on the hook for replacement does not end the question though.  The fact that an item which is 7 years into a useful lifespan of 10 years is destroyed does not mean the tenant is liable for the full cost of replacement.  A good analogy that most people understand is that if you total my 10 year old car you don’t have to buy me a new car, you have to pay me the value of a 10 year old car. Again, the depreciation value isn’t what’s going to control here, but some sort of estimate as to the actual value of the item at the time it was damaged it would be paid. This sort of calculation is often not going to be an exact science, but one way might be to figure out what the reasonable use period for the item installed was, figure out where you are in that, then take whatever % was left and pay that % of new carpet. So for example... 

o	Say you are 6 years into a carpet that should last 10 years, you pay 40% of replacing the carpet with something similar to what is there now. This doesn’t mean you pay 40% of the landlords new fancy tile floor, you would pay 40% of similar carpet. 

o	Nor does the replacement of carpet in one room require replacement in all rooms.  Turning again to the car analogy, if you don’t total a car, but rather simply damage the bumper, you do not have to pay for the full car, you pay for the bumper as it is a separately replaceable part.  So to the carpet, that the carpet in the master bedroom needs to be replaced doesn’t necessarily require the carpet in the other bedrooms or the common area needs to be replaced.  As such, the tenant would be liable only for the replacement costs in the master bedroom.  That the landlord elects to replace the rest of the carpet does not make the tenant liable for this replacement.

•	The period for return of your deposit will vary by state (typically 30-45 days), but with the return of the deposit the landlord is required to provide an itemized list of deductions.  The timeline for dispute will again vary by state, but if you disagree with the deductions you should notify the landlord in writing as soon as possible.

•	Interest on deposits – as noted in the introduction, a deposit is the tenant’s money until it is deducted for a valid reason.  As generally speaking if the money is held in an interest bearing account (and often it must be), that interest belongs to the tenant, not the landlord.  However there are exceptions, a common one being that the landlord may keep some amount of interest to cover the costs of maintaining the account.  Local laws on this issue vary, so you should check to ensure that your deposit is being kept in a proper account and that you are receiving any interest you are entitled to.

Well this has become much longer than planned, but hopefully its helpful!

**Drive around**: drive around the area and look for signs or complexes. Find places that look well kept. Drive by at night, on a weekend. Is it loud? Crazy activity. Young people? Old people?  

**Internet**: Great way to look at a lot of places. But there are a lot (A LOT) of scams out there. So be careful. Do not give anyone money if you cannot look at the place first.

**Friends**: Best way to go. Ask friends. They may have a room or know someone or a good complex. 

**College bulletin boards**: people post rooms for rent there. Assuming you are in college, you are getting people in roughly the same situation you are. But make sure you can stand living with the person (people) before agreeing. 


**Scams**: If you hear any of the following, it is likely a scam. 
“I will mail you the keys”
“I am out of the country right now”
“I will send you a check…”


**What to look for/ask when renting a unit/home:**
How will rent be paid
What is the deposit, application fee, background check fee, first/last months rent needed
Who/how to handle emergencies
Who pays what utilities
Look for existing damage. Is the place well cared for or a hot mess?
Look for damage to doors and windows. That might be a sign of crime. 

**Crime**: You can generally find crime states for areas online. Google and see what you can find. Look for property damage and drug arrests. Both can be a bad sign. 

**Looking to rent with friends**: Figure things out ahead of time. Sign a roommate agreement. It will make things easier. You can google Roommate agreement. You can change what you need to change. Just make sure that it makes sense to anyone not involved.  Because a judge needs to be able to understand it, because if it goes to court, that is who has to understand it. Know that if your buddy doesnt pay his part of the rent, you will be responsible if you both signed one lease. 

**Renters insurance**: GET RENTERS INSURANCE. It is cheap (generally under $20 a month). And will cover a lot of damages to your stuff in case of a fire or flood (have them go over what is covered). Insurance can also sometimes cover your things while moving.

**Types of rentals: 
**

Renting a home – Pros: No shared walls. Generally washer/dryer (W/D) in unit. Cons: bigger space to maintain. Yard to maintain. Possible HOA rules to follow. 

Renting an apartment/Condo – Pros: Cheaper than a home. On site amenities (pool, laundry room, gym). Cons: shared walls. Smaller space

Renting a room – Pros: cheapest options. Small space to maintain and furnish. Cons: a lot of shared space. 

**Types of leases: 
**

Term lease: Generally 6:12:18 months. Pros: set amount of rent for a set period of time. Security in knowing you have a place to stay for that amount of time. Cons: if you have to move, you will be paying a lot to break the lease. 

Month to month: Pros: flexible. If you are likely to move in a short time or don’t have a stable job location, this is a good option. Easy to give notice and end the tenancy. Cons: Rent can be changed with proper notice (generally 30 days but varies by state). Tenancy can be ended with proper notice (Again, generally 30 days but depends on state). 

Weekly: some places do weekly tenancy. Same as monthly but all the notice periods are shorter. So a lot of flexibility but also the tenancy can be ended with little notice. 

Sublease: A sublease can be any of the above but it is with another tenant. You sign (or oral) a lease with the tenant. That means that the tenant is your landlord. So you will pay them and deal with them regarding problems. Know that many places do NOT allow subleasing and this could cause problems down the road. Be very cautious with subleasing. If your landlord doesn’t pay the rent, you will be evicted right along with them.

There are legit work from home (telecommute) jobs out there. Finding them is not that easy though. Because a lot of them are scams. 

Is work from home for you: You have to be timely. They track you. They want to make sure you are working. So they do keep track of your activity. You have to be self motivated. There is no boss down the hall watching you. 

Rule: if it is too good to be true, it is a scam. No one is going to pay you $800 a week to collect checks, transfer money, mail things. It just doesnt happen. Look for real companies with real, W2 jobs. 

How to look: Search terms are important. Work from home, telecommute, remote. Every company that does work from home uses a different term. So, part of the search is finding out what term the company uses. 

What jobs: these are going to be mostly customer services, project management, analyst, and medical (phone RN), web/social media.  

Where to look: some of the top companies:
Amazon, United Health Group, Conduent. But there are a lot of other companies. 

My suggestion: go to flexjobs.com . DO NOT pay for an account. look at the sample jobs/prior listings that are free. Learn what terms the company uses for WFH jobs. The go to that companies website and search for yourself. 

There are a ton of WFH jobs for teaching people to speak english. If this is something interesting to you, read reviews. It is independent contractor jobs and they are not easy to make money at as you have to get a good rating to get more students and you have to just sit and wait for someone to pick you. So, not ideal for everyone. 

Applying: Tailor your resume (we have a resume guide) to the job. It may take some time to make your current skills match what they are looking for. Having a friend look over things can help as they are able to look at your experience differently. 

Interview: it will be over the phone. So be prepared. Smile. No one can see but they can hear it. Write notes down. Keep your resume handy. Be professional. Just because it is over the phone doesnt mean it isnt a job interview. So take it seriously. ",Adulting101,Finding Work From Home Jobs,0.0

Literally throw stuff in, turn it on, walk a way. Come back in 4-8 hours and it is done. Here are my favorite easy slow cooker recipes.

Slow cookers are not baking. Nothing is exact! If you have something in your fridge or pantry and think it would be good: add it. 

Slow cookers do matter with what meat to get. They are not something you throw expensive meat into. Rump Roast, chicken thighs, boston butt. Awesome. But not something you are going to put steaks in.

 If you are using ground meat (chilis) you must cook the meat before putting it in the slow cooker. Everything else can go in raw. 

It is not recommended to put frozen meat in a slow cooker. It will sit at an unsafe temp for too long. Have I put chicken that is ""mostly"" thawed in? Yes and it is fine. But not fully frozen. 

Know the size of your slow cooker! You can put too much in. If you have a small slow cooker (4 qt) dont buy a 5 pound roast! 

Pork roasts: boston butt is awesome. I do not like bone in. But that is 100% personal. I have had a few that just were not good. Bone out boston butt runs around 1.00-1.60 a pound. So watch the prices. It will go low and that is when you buy, cook, and freeze for later. 

**BBQ beef (or pork)**

Beef roast (or pork), onion (one small, or half a large), bbq sauce. 

Chop the onions. Large chop is fine. I do it in long strings. Line the bottom with onions. Clean up your roast. Take off the large skit of fat on the bottom. Salt and pepper the thing to your taste. Drop it on top of the onions. Dump in half the thing of BBQ. The meat will release juices! It wont be dry. Dont stress! Low for 8. I never feel like red meat does well on high. You can either eat it straight out of the cooker or take out some meat, heat up a pan, throw some meat in with some BBQ sauce and caramelize. 

**Carnitas**

Pork roast, adobo seasoning, onion. 

Same as above. Clean up the fat skirt. Line the bottom with onions. Coat the roast with seasoning. Use more than you might think. I coat it pretty good. Low for 8. As with the BBQ, you can take it out and throw some of the shredded meat into a hot pan to caramelize it. 

**Salsa Chicken**

Chicken breasts (or boneless skinless thighs), Salsa (dont get expensive stuff), taco seasoning, veggies if you want

Line the bottom with veggies (onion, peppers). chuck in the chicken breasts. Cover with half a jar of salsa and taco seasoning (two tablespoons (I like a lot) or one taco packet). This one you can do on 4hrs high or 8hrs low. I mix it once it is hot, about an hour in. But not required. 


**Ribs**

Ribs. BBQ rub seasoning (not sauce)

Rub your ribs down (with sexy music if you like) with the seasoning. Wrap in tinfoil. Place vertically lining the walls. 4hrs on high. You can eat them as is or pull them out, cover with bbq sauce and put in your broiler for a few minutes to caramelize.

Before anything else, if you are a victim of a crime and are in a situation that is dangerous to your life or safety, get somewhere safe, then file the report.

Once you are safe, it is important to report it to the police as quickly as possible.  Either by calling 911 (in an emergency situation) or your local non-emergency police number (for most non-emergency situations, like: identity theft, car break-ins (with the suspect long gone) and other property related crimes of that nature). 

Also, please understand that 911 calls and non-emergency calls get dispatched out by a priority system.  The general rule is life before property.  So if you have been the victim of a burglary, but the burglary has already happened and the suspect is long gone, then the police response will be superseded if an accident with injuries or an assault call comes in at the same time.

Even if you don’t think the crime that occurred to you is important in the grand scheme of things (like your car was entered into, but nothing was damaged and nothing was stolen), it is still advisable to make a police report because that helps your local police investigate similar crimes and direct their manpower to “hot-spots” to help reduce crime.

Depending on the type of crime you are reporting, you can make it over the phone or an officer will actually meet with you in person.  Even if you have evidence (like video of the suspect), if the crime is a low priority, the department may have their officers generate the report with you over the phone and then allocate a follow up investigation with a detective. (Which would be the person you really want to view the evidence.  If the crime is something that a uniform officer handles all the way through, then ask that officer on the phone what the best way is to get them the evidence.  If the officer responds in person, just give them the evidence then).

When you do file a police report try to remember the “Five W’s”.  We understand that you will not always be able to answer all the “Ws” but everything you can answer helps.

Who – Who is the suspect?  Who is the victim?  Is the suspect known or are they strangers?  Describe the suspect (try to be as detailed as possible – gender, skin color (this goes beyond just race because skin pigments can vary greatly) height, weight, clothing, scars-marks-tattoos, odd ways of talking.)  Is the suspect armed?  Does the suspect have a vehicle?  Describe the vehicle…

What- What actually happened to make you call the police?  Not the long drawn out backstory, but what happened today (or the day the crime occurred).  Do you have direct knowledge of what happened or are you calling for someone else?  Be detailed when describing what the suspect did or is doing.  If you are calling in suspicious activity, be specific. (Green man walking in my neighborhood = not specific.  Purple man is walking in my neighborhood and he keeps looking in different vehicles and trying to open doors = a good example of suspicious activity).  If you are the victim of a theft, what was taken?  Describe the item.  Do you have pictures of it?  Serial Numbers?...

Where- Where did the crime occur?  Did it happen in the same place you are calling from?  If it happened elsewhere, then you may need to be diverted to a different police department who has jurisdiction over the actual incident location….

When- When did the crime occur?  If it happened yesterday, why are you calling today?  Be prepared to explain any big delay in why you reported the crime.  It is okay to sometimes be unsure if you want to make a report, but be prepared to get asked that question.  If you can give a very specific time frame for a crime, it helps the police in their investigations and allocation of man-power…

Why- This is not victim blaming.  But, in certain circumstances, you will be asked “why” you are the victim of a crime.  If you know the suspect and he robbed you, do you know why he robbed you?  Are y’all having a dispute over money or love or something else?  Why also gives us motive.  It helps us understand why you were targeted if it is not a random crime…

How- How did the suspect commit the crime against you?  If you are the victim of a burglary, how did they get into your house?  How did they exit your house?  If you are the victim of an assault, how did they assault you?  If you are the victim of financial card fraud, how did they get your information (if you know)?  How did they get your card’s PIN? …

The above are just examples of the types of questions that need to be answered with the “5 Ws”.  Of course, there are many many more examples especially when you start breaking police reports down by specific crimes.

So, you have filed a police report and want to know what happens next.  It depends on the crime, on the police department and sometimes what you want done.  Some departments have uniform officers handle low level investigations and dole out the higher priority stuff to detectives.   Generally speaking, if your case needs further investigation it will get assigned to a detective.  If you need an update for your case, try and call the department (with your case number handy) and ask for the detective division that handles your particular type of crime.  From there, ask for the detective assigned to your case.  Most uniform officers only handle the initial report, so trying to call them may not be worthwhile and instead it is advised to try and get in touch with the investigative element of your local police department.  The detective assigned to your case will be the one you deal with most of the time, if it is a case that will be investigated further.

At the end of the day, the more information you can give during the initial police report (and subsequent follow-ups with your detective- like bank statements, receipts, serial numbers etc…) the better chances a successful investigation can be conducted on your behalf. 


This post is already long enough so I will end it here with plans on doing more specific types of 101’s in the future.  I hope this helped at least one person.

What gives?

1.) **Network, network, network.** Get on LinkedIn. Talk to your network of people. Having a referral vastly increases your chances of seeing a job in time, and getting it. Don't be afraid to tell people you need help finding a job.  Networking events specific to your industry can also work.

2.) **Have someone else read your resume and critique it.** You can ask a recruiter to do this, or a friend in HR, or a job counselor. r/Jobs and r/resumes sees posts occasionally where someone went months with some stupid mistake like a bad phone # on a resume. You can also, of course, use r/resumes.

3.) **Do mock interviews**. Interviews are nerve wracking, especially for introverts, folks with autism, folks with depression, etc. Mock interviews let you do an interview in a friendly setting, get instant feedback, and help you get confidence that you're not screwing up every second of the interview. Recruiters might help here, career coaches will do it (they're expensive though), or you can go to any job training type place and see if they can help.  If you know someone who works in management and interviews candidates, that's perfect.

4.) **Tailor your resume to the job posting**. If a job posting has 5 skills that are listed as absolutely necessary, then you need your resume to be focused on those 5 skills. More and more places literally roundfile resumes right off the bat if they don't have enough keywords. The amount of time your resume is in front of someone's eyeballs is measured in seconds - your resume needs to use those seconds wisely.

5.) **Volunteer.** Volunteering helps you network, and looks good on a resume as showing you as well-rounded. It also is a good conversation piece in an interview when someone asks your interests. If you are trying to break into a specific industry or company, volunteering at places that fit that industry or at the favored charity of that company is an **excellent** network opportunity into where you are trying to go. For example, one of my clients heavily supports JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation). If you volunteer at JDRF or do one of their events, you're going to run into employees of that company all over the place.

6.) **Get less picky.** Maybe your city is not doing well in your industry. Maybe you are going to need to find something similar to your career. Maybe you're going to need to accept less pay temporarily. At the end of the day, having a job generally beats not having a job, and it's easier to get a job when you have one than when you don't.",Adulting101,Guide for when your job hunt stalls,0.0

But a decent knife (not a massive one, not a tiny one) will make everything so much easier. It needs a decent handle too. The tang (the bit that extends into the handle) needs to go through the entire length of the handle. 

Sharpener (see above). A dull knife isn't only not a knife really, its an accident waiting to happen.

For both of the above, look at resale/goodwill. I've got both quality knives and sharpeners from resale stores. You can be all ""Oh I will only sharpened my knife with an $80 whetstone not an electric sharpener"", but most people simply want a knife that will cut a tomato.

A small saucepan. You want to boil couple of eggs? You don't want to spend more money to heat a large volume of water. And try to make sure it will sit on your burners properly (if you have a gas stove). Very small pans tend to tip.

A medium size (9 - 10"") frying pan. Now its up to you if you want to get non-stick, iron, whatever.

My personal experience is: there are lot of moderately priced pans out there that work fine for a period of time. But the only type of pan that you can rely on long term is cast iron pan. Because even if you do something awful to them you can reseason them. But I still have lighter weight pans because I'm older, less able to pick up a heavy pan, better off, and can afford to trash pans that aren't performing as I wish them to.

A ""dutch oven"". Basically a large tallish pan with a lid that can be used on top of the stove or in the oven.

A large pot to cook pasta in. It might have a draining insert (if it doesn't you also need a colander). Useful for not only pasta, but making soup etc. Needs a lid. If it doesn't have one, put something on top of it (plate, foil) to save energy and reducing heating time.

Measuring cups. Measuring spoons. Available from your local dollar store.

Can opener.

Bottle opener. Not absolutely essential but you need a beer while you're doing this cooking. Which leads us to... cork screw. You can (I have) removed a cord by pushing the cork into the bottle and hooking string or dental floss under it but again, dollar store item.

Some kind of baking tray for cookies. At a pinch you can use foil but getting the cookies into the oven can be ... stressful. Getting them out worse.

A chopping board. Plastic, wood- your call (although wood or bamboo is supposed to be better with regard to bacterial contamination).

You drink coffee? You need either a coffee pot, French press (you can heat the water in that large pot) or some kind of pour over filter system, (see large pot).

Not essential but wish list:

Really big frying pan: makes frying for more than one or two much easier.

Slow cooker. Really. It's not just for your mother. Want carnitas?Stuff that pork shoulder in there before you go to work. Best way to cook corned beef? Slow cooker.

Pressure cooker. Yes scary, but really you're working and you need dinner on the table in 45 minutes? Look at pressure cooker. Or, of course something like a insta pot which does both of these things.

Rolling pin. But you can use a bottle at a pinch.

I've probably forgotten something major so do please add.

But I'll restate: goodwill, resale stores, dollar stores. Don't assume you have to buy everything at retail.

**BUDGETING** 

You need a line item on your budget for food. You should also have a second line item for eating out if possible. Personally: for a single young person with normal health $100 should be enough. But you have to shop smart. 

Keep track of what you are actually spending. Keep your receipts. At the end of the month, add it up and make sure you are working within your budget. If it is an ongoing problem of going over, then re-work your budget. 

**SHOPPING**

Check the ads. Build your grocery list off of what is one sale. Find easy meals you like and will eat, over and over. Buying in bulk is cheaper. Learn to freeze your food correctly. Use actual freezer bags and push all the air out of them. Write on it what it is and when you froze it. Anything over 6 months: chuck it. Google what you can and cannot freeze (shrimp is a no). 

Buy things that are not expensive and make more than one meal. Rice, eggs, potatoes. All cheap in bulk. I loved rice with an over easy  egg and soy sauce. It was a great meal. 

Coupons are great but take time to find, go through, make sure you have with you. Personally, I think they are more work than they are worth in a lot of areas. But sometimes you get awesome ones at the store at check out. So check those ones. 

**MEAL PREPING**

Having meals ready and planned before you are hungry is helpful and keeps you from impulse eating at fast food. Time is precious. A crock pot is awesome. Easy to use and food ready when you are home at the end of the day. It is also good for making a large amount of food to freeze for later. 

Simple cheap recipes for the crock pot: 
BBQ Meat: 1 pork or beef roast. Get something cheap. Cut off large fat sections. Don’t cut the meat up. Leave it as a big hunk. Chopped up onion on the bottom (I like large strips), half a bottle of BBQ sauce. Done! Low for 8 hours. Shred it. Freeze your extra. 
Chicken Taco meat: Chicken breast – boneless skinless. Half a thing of salsa. Pack of taco seasoning. Any other veggies you want to add. Can or two of beans if you like.  8 hours on low. Shred. Tortilla and whatever else you have. If you want to: drain the liquid out as much as you can, roll in a tortilla with cheese. Wrap in microwave save wax paper or plastic wrap. Freeze. Boom, easy cheap frozen burritos on the go. 

I like budgetbytes.com for cheap recipes with good directions. 


**SNACKING**

While I was in college, I didn’t budget in food. Just had my set expenses and everything left over was food and fun. Until I over drafted my account into oblivion. I was buying my food at the college convenience store. Which was the worst thing I could have done and here is why. 

The snack foods are so overpriced. You are paying for convenience of it being there and the impulse of wanting it when you are hungry. 

Planning ahead can save you a ton of money. Buy soda and take it with you. Buy a good water bottle and fill it at home. Buy large packs of snacks:

A pack of cookies: $3 for 30 cookies. Gas station/school store: $1.50 for 6. 

A pack of snack chips: $6 for 20. So $.30 each. At the gas station/school store. $1. 


So, buy your snacks at the grocery store and just pack them with you every time you head out. Tons of money savings. 

**
TLDR: Budget for food. Buy things on sale. Make food at home. Buy snack food and take them with you.**

I've done recruiting for tech jobs, for educational contractors, for teachers, for skilled labor types and for entry level employees. The trend is the same. None of you know how to tell me why I should hire you in &lt; 500 words. 

Given that many of your real life adult person jobs involve competing with dozens, if not literal hundreds of applicants, this is an issue. 

So here's a reddit post that can theoretically help. 

**A Cover Letter is an Essay**. 

No different than the 5 paragraph essays you wrote in school. There's a thesis, a goal, and research. As follows:

**Thesis**: ""XYZ make me the best candidate for this job"" XYZ are going to be elements from your resume. **THIS DOES NOT MEAN JUST COPY PASTE YOUR RESUME.** The cover letter is a chance to expand upon those bullet points and tell the person reading your letter why these skills are important and how they apply to their needs for an employee.

**Research**: You are writing a **targeted** cover letter. That means you're going to look at the job posting (if you're not responding to the requested skills listed as necessary in the posting you're gonna have a bad time), the company, read up on them (yes, that mission statement on their website, relevant news stories, press releases), and tailor your letter to that. Yes, this is going to take more time. Yes it makes a difference. Recruiters want you to be applying for **this** job, not any job. A copy/paste form letter that obviously went to 150 companies is a bad look.

**Goal**: Your goal from the cover letter is **not** to get a job. It's to get a phone call. So you can then interview. And continue to interview. And maybe get hired. You are setting the expectation for this conversation to continue. That means you're not going to simply end the letter. You're going to offer follow up contact information and a couple days that you're reachable ('call me anytime' reeks of desperation. Even if you are desperate it's a bad look).  

Ok, this is already too long. Final thoughts:

**Tone**: You need to be polite, respectful, and above all understand that at *no point in this relationship will you be asking more of an employer for less return than this letter.* An application to hire process represents thousands of dollars of work for a company. 

**Don't list skills that are expected**: Here are a few employee skills that would immediately get a letter in the trash: ""punctual."" ""works well with others."" ""self motivated."" 

YOU'RE A GROWNASS ADULT. THIS IS EXPECTED. Putting this down as a positive in your cover letter is like me offering to house sit and adding ""yeah I totally don't set fires."" 

Alright, that's a reasonable summary of a week's lectures I'd give to writing students about this. 

TL;DR version: Read the job posting. Respond to the posting emphasizing skills from your resume that fit their needs. Be polite, professional, and take the 20 minutes to customize your letter for the company you want to work for.",Adulting101,You don't know how to write a cover letter [101],0.0

**Processing payments:**

So the first thing I will cover is how payments get processed when using a credit card as payment, as this will be referenced later.

Payments happen in three steps when you use a credit card

1. *Pre-Authorization* - This step happens the moment you swipe your card (or hit submit payment on an online purchase). During this step the merchant's systems will talk to your bank's systems and say ""Hey, *person* is trying to make a purchase for $xx.xx, do they have enough funds?"" your bank will either say ""Yes."" or ""No."" and that determines if the purchase is approved or denied. If the purchase is approved, then **your bank** places a hold on the funds so they don't get spent until the merchant completes the next step.

2. *Reconciliation* - This step usually happens in the middle of the night, the day after your purchase, but most merchants have 72 hours to complete this step (though the time frame can vary wildly with certain types of merchants/transactions). This is when the merchant (or their system) finalizes any credit transactions for the day, which typically happens after the store is closed, which is why it usually happens in the middle of the night.",Adulting101,[101] Some (generally) unknown things that happen with (most) credit cards.,0.0

There are some great subs out there that can help with specific types of problems, but there isn’t any one place to go to learn the basics of being an adult. That’s where we come in.

Simply put, /r/adulting101 will provide introductory level advice and tips for folks just starting out. We’ve all been confused by things that it seems like everyone knows:

How do you file your taxes?

How do you handle workplace conflicts?

How do you know if that apartment is a good deal, or a nightmare waiting to happen?

How do you buy a car?

How do you plan a budget?

What do I need to buy for my first kitchen?

We hope to be the place to find answers to these kinds of questions. /r/adulting101 will be more than just a simple advice sub; we’ll also provide resources and guides to basic life skills.

Please feel free to ask questions about your particular problem, or to post a 101 guide of your own!


**I stole the above from /u/Ramady**

This sub is a great idea that got lost due to busy lives. I feel that this can be a place to help people avoid the legal problems we see at /r/legaladvice . 

So to add to the above: please respond to this post if you have ideas of 101 guides that you would like to see. ",Adulting101,Welcome to Adulting 101,0.0

&amp;#x200B;

I in one of the student living situations near campus in LA. My landlord is mean and is a bully who needs to establish his authority over the tenants (especially the students). I had always attributed it to the prejudice that students aren't responsible, etc. He was nice to me for a year and I decided to renew the lease.   


My landlord and I hadn't had many issues and I decided to renew the lease for another year. I found a new roommate for the year later on. He and I had agreed that he will add my roommate's name to the lease once I find a new one. I passed on all of her documents to him, she paid the application fee, the security deposit. I informed my landlord that she would be arriving on Monday to sign the lease and complete formalities. He agreed and told me to have her call him on Monday to discuss when she can sign the lease.

My new roommate had arrived in LA on Saturday and went over to the building on Sunday to check out my place where the people I had subletted the place for the summer agreed to show her around.

He saw her and she went over and introduced herself and her friend who had come to help her settle in. She didn't realize at first that he was the landlord and so did not approach him. He was mad about the fact that she entered the premises without the tenant accompanying her. Now, I am not really sure what happened, but the landlord felt disrespected (apparently in front of his employee) by them for asking him when time they could go over on Monday to sign the lease. The whole thing seems to be a big misunderstanding for no reason. 

I called him up and he is now saying that her application to stay in the building is still under consideration because she disrespected him. I had her apologize over a phone call and via email. He isn't ready to listen. And, in fact was quite mean to me when I tried to talk to him about the issue.  

I am not sure what I can do next. I called him up to convince him that she or her didn't mean any disrespect. She apologized, was prompt with her documents and now it looks like she doesn't have a place to stay and I have to pay the whole rent myself. Any advice soon would be very welcome.",Adulting101,Dealing with Bullies,0.0

A little bit about me: 

- I'm a 24 year old immigrant.
- Lived all my life in a terrible 3rd world country. No future there.
- Im half European, so I could move to the first world 9 months ago.
- 8 out of those 9 months, I've been studying to level myself up in my field (I didnt have basic technology resources back in the 3rd world) 
-I know that my job experience and education from my old  country  is a joke to employers and companies in the new country. I can't blame them.
- My education here has been great, I've learned a LOT and I'm so grateful, but I'm always the least capable of the classroom and that has made me extremely insecure. I'm always left out of side projects. It's okay.

-My parents support me financially  and I'm safe and comfortable.  We have a good relationship and they are unconditional.

I know I have a past but I cant help to feel completely embarrassed. I feel bad with myself.

 I want to be 100% independent. That is my goal. I dont want to be a burden. I want my parents to enjoy their money and stop spending on a 25 year old baby.


I've been looking for a job for a month and a half. Needless to say, I've been rejected or ignored.

I decided to apply for an internship and I kinda got the vibe that the boss likes me and he will choose me. I will know about his decision on Wednesday. He's part of a huge company with a lot of status in my field.

It's an Internship. They won't pay me and that's okay. I'm kinda doing it to land a job after the 3 or 4 months are over. To prove that I know something and I can do things here. 

I want to get this opportunity  but I keep thinking about how much time this is taking. 4 months more to my time trying to be independent. I feel really scared. It's taking me FOREVER to build myself as a productive adult and it's killing me inside.

I asked Bossguy if I could expect getting a job after finishing the internship. He said yes, only if he could land  3 new major clients in that time. Basically he said ""who knows"" so i dont even consider it a possibility. He hasn't even decided if he wants me there.

I just feel really lost. I feel embarrassed about myself, about where I come from. I cant stop comparing myself with others... idk. I want to be a functional adult so bad. 

Idk. Sorry if this is more a rant. I'm just really scared and lost and I need opinions

There was some serious damage done, it needs a new hood, bumper, headlights, (possibly the radiator ever though its actually running fine at the moment) and there is probably some frame damage (my car is a Honda Civic, his is a Ford F550 dump truck :/) My car was off and in park, I was no where near the vehicle and the other driver and are I both in agreeance that they are at fault. We exchanged all of the applicable information with each other. Yesterday he called his insurer to open a claim and told me that an adjuster would be calling me soon. All of this is seemingly going smoothly but here's what I'm worried about and I'm hoping that y'all can either put this fear to rest or help me find a way to best handle this situation.

My Car is a 2001 Honda Civic LX, I bought it in October of 2018, it only had 44k miles on it and was basically mint condition until a couple of days ago, it was like driving a new car. The Kelly Blue Book value of my vehicle is below $4,000. I have yet to take the car to a body shop yet for a quote but I assume that the total cost of the repairs will exceed that of the vehicle, however it still runs just fine. What I'm worried about is that his insurance will tell me its totaled and only give me a check for what they assess the vehicle to be worth which won't be nearly enough to pay for the repairs on this car or replacing it with a car of equal value.

Can they do this legally? What is their obligation to me if anything? What should I be expecting to get out of this?

Joint bank accounts with parents can be super helpful sometimes but also a liability. If someone else is attached (jointly) to your bank account, they can legally take any money out of that account at any time. And their debts may effect your bank account also. 

The best thing to do it keep your joint account but put your money in a separate account that is only in your name.

Don’t be the friend always asking for money from others, in this economy especially a lot of people don’t have the extra cash to maybe/maybe not get paid back from their friends. They don’t want to grovel to get their money back, and it’s a behavior that can impact friendships.

My partner has a running tab from a friend that he bailed out of jail, helped fix a car, paid for a speeding ticket. He has since set boundaries on what, how much, and when he might loan money to someone and it’s always with a schedule. Skip this ask, and go to one of the below options.

Are you under 18?

Start out strong by signing a signature loan with a parent or guardian! This will be a loan from a local or national bank that is secured with a parents’ signature. You will lose a small amount of money paying interest, but in exchange you will gain a better credit score which is a HUGE boost in this economy. (America, primarily, but other major nations may have similar structure.)

Having a higher credit score will give you more loan availability, credit limits (will go into more later), lower interest and greater flexibility in payback.

LOANS

It’s beneficial to already have a banking account (with direct deposit) set up. If you haven’t yet, I would pick a Credit Union because they are more locally invested, often give you higher interest on return, and less charged interest on loans and credit cards.

Loans must have minimum amount due paid on date due, this contributes to your credit score and is a major player in how lending establishments view your likelihood to pay back money owed. It is essential that if you do the signature loan, you make these installments in this fashion or you will start your credit score off on a bad foot which is harder to recover.

CREDIT CARDS

Do not - I repeat - DO NOT use credit cards to float your lifestyle. No pair of Timberlands is worth paying an extra $100 in interest for. Use them to build your credit by using for gas or groceries. Allow the amount due to hit the billing period, pay off bill in full.

In major financial emergencies, you can use a loan (if you have the ability) or credit cards to cover you. Let’s say you have a car repair of $1000, but only $500 in your savings account. Use at least $300 toward your credit card bill on first statement, pay more than the minimum amount due, pay it off as soon as possible. Interest is charged by the billing period, so you don’t want the rollover debt to accrue a high amount in interest because that causes the repair value to be higher. Banks use the interest they charge you as their profit.

I'm in a bit of a bind and don't know where to reach out to at this point. Hopefully there are some nice people of the internet with more experience than myself.

It's a long story and I don't know how to explain really, but I'm currently franticly apartment hunting and I keep hitting walls. I'd be living with friends but due to some issues with their backgrounds the lease of whatever place we would go to would be under my name. The issue is that I've no income/job at the moment and alot of places require proof that you work and make a certain amount. 

I've been living with my family for over the past year after coming back from out of state due to a bad relationship and I've not had much of an opportunity to work because shortly after I moved home my dad became ill and was homebound. With my mom and siblings working and me just recently moving in I had the most availability and was asked if I could stay and put off work for awhile to stay with my dad and help as need, but that lasted for a year so I was the bound to home with him. 

I moved out in late October with some friends and my fiance a bit less than an hour drive away. But due to a roommate and his girlfriends domestic issues the police were contacted a number of times. Shortly after the holiday a notice was put on the door asking us to leave before legal action was taken.

There's four of us here and we had just paid rent and purchased groceries for the month before we got the notice so money is really tight and we don't really have the luxury to just pack up and move wherever. Aside from that there's been job complications so money has been tight anyways.

I'm really just lost at this point thing were going well and I was excited to be out living in my own. After everything I've had to deal with the past few years, despite being poor and struggling a bit, it's something I'm used to so it's been nice.

However now I'm just immensely overwhelmed because getting a new place heavily leans on my name and credibility as a good person. I don't have any criminal record and I did have my name on the lease of an apartment I lived in for two years, but I no information on that to give other than the address due to my ex keeping alot of information from me. 

I honestly don't know what to do. I'm trying my best but there's only so much I can do with my lack of experience and knowledge and I'm starting to crumble under the pressure. I don't any of us to be homeless after everything we've all been through. We've all had issues growing up and we've all bounced around from different places as kids and I think it's safe to say we're all just tired and we just want to be safe and have somewhere to go home to.

My parents don't say i love you to me..because they are south asian and demonstrate love to me in different ways. They also never say anything great about me. I know worthiness is suppose to come within me...I feel betrayed by this guy i loved. He is also marrying someone else. It shatters my heart. I've gone to counselling numerous times. I just don't know what I can do to fill this void. Also I do want to say, there has been times where I did stop thinking about him and started enjoying the little things in life. But I feel like currently, I'm not happy with the type of friends I have , where I am in life, also I am having this battle of putting myself out there with confidence. I feel like people can tell im not confident although sometimes I'm not thinking about my confidence and I am just being.

I'm having a few issues:

I am done my undergrad 2 years ago. I'm 27 years old. I live with my family in Toronto. I lived away from home during my undergrad and learn to live on my own.  It was still a definitely struggle, and I had a hard time managing my time with school. 

I studied political science and economics. I had a crush on this guy since high and he took up most of my mind during my undergrad so I didn't perform and wasn't really there in mind during classes, because he preoccupied my time. I then later ended our friendship because I realized I needed to focus on myself and finish school. There were times were I still couldn't stop thinking about him, felt lonely...only because I felt comfortable around him, but at the same was stressed when I was with him because I realized how insecure I was. I feel like I was super insecure.  I never knew if he had liked me or not. when i say i was with him, i mean we just hung out but weren't really in a relationship. I had trust issues with him and I'm not sure if it was me being insecure about myself.

I graduated two years ago with a bachelors degree in political science and economics, but my grades were like crap. For a year I worked at a bank as a background screening analyst, and screened all candidates that applied to the bank and had to minimize risk for the bank. I really didn't like this job because I found it repetitive and very slow in terms of technology and process, which made me work overtime almost all the time. the management sucked.

I feel like i did terrible in my undergrad because I had a hard time focusing due my personal issues. I have been going to a counsellor and trying to work on myself and feel like I need to work more on loving myself.

Right now, I decided to leave my job even though it paid out well, or enough, but I thought I can find another job that'd pay me better. I also find myself comparing myself to others who in careers such as accounting, nursing, engineers, doctors, or like I feel like i never knew what it was I wanted to do, and now that I'm 27, I have no friggen idea what I like. I feel like I'm not good at anything or know anything that is useful. Something I'm good at is being supportive but I don't think it's something I want to have a career in. I feel like I am financially illiterate. I think I liked economics but i wasn't good at it because of pressure and personal issues again and the ability to not be able to focus. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question is how do you figure out what you like to do? I feel like what if I walk into accounting (Esp because i never took any accounting courses in my undergrad) and don't end up liking it? Right now, I'm taking a free digital marketing courses and a few courses on [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) on coding to open up job opportunities. I think I want to do my masters, but I did really poorly during my undergrad so I don't think I'll get in anywhere, and what if I do terrible during my masters and get into more debt?

Recently I found out the guy who i had a crush on since high school ( the same guy) is getting married and its triggered so much emotions. I think what i liked about him was that he knew so much and i think i was always insecure about my intelligence. I don't have a big family, and so socializing is hard when your family doesn't go to a lot socializing events, i'm not close to my family as he is to. he has a lot of cousins who hang out with each other, and do a lot of social things where they learn from one another.

I feel like his wife is soo pretty, gorgeous, she was definitely a better choice than me, but I wish I had it all. Shes a nurse, she not on social media all the time, i've seen her at the shops and she is just studying away and hasa  lot of focus. its super admirable and i wish I had that. I feel like it's exactly why I didn't want to be with him because I didn't think I was at his level and he could do better. I feel like if I want to be with someone that is like him, then i'm going to have to work on having all that...Am I being too hard on myself?'

I feel like some people know what they want in life and they are able to get it...why do people like me struggle? Maybe it's because I don't spend enough time on my own?but then I also feel like i don't spend enough time with confident people. Where can I find confident people in my life with good energy?  I feel like a complete mess. I don't know what I want in life.",Adulting101,Feeling super lost,0.0

Just yesterday I had a huge fight with my parents for unrelated reasons. From there I was lectured on how I wasn't doing much to help my own life as a college sophomore. They told me that I wasn't doing much in the way of becoming an adult, and I just want to improve that. 

&amp;#x200B;

For context, here's what I've been doing:

\- I am finishing up my 3 month long engineering internship

\- I took two college classes this summer

\- Two semesters ago I established Korean classes at Purdue

\- I am in Purdue Space Program, the source of my internship and some of my aerospace engineering information

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, this isn't nearly enough. It all sounds good on paper, but I'm currently lazy about logistical stuff (missed the deadline on lofting my bed because I didn't know about it, etc) and I'm not good enough about motivating myself to learn more about things like student loans, budgeting, etc - **even learning about my own major**. I was told in the past that I wouldn't have to support myself financially - as long as I was doing things that would help me out in the future, such as having a job or taking classes, my parents would fully support my endeavors. This means not having to worry about gas, car upkeep, even down to packing my own lunch.

&amp;#x200B;

I realize now that I've been extremely lucky and pretty much terribly ungrateful for what I've been given, so much so that I hadn't been talking to my parents. I fell under the guise of ""I'm too tired"" or ""I'm too busy with class/job/relationship"" - and I want to fix all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Since yesterday and today then, all I've been doing is researching how to invest in the stock market, how to be on top of my loans, and trying to take baby steps into true adulthood. My only problem is that I've always been on the mindset of ""if I was just shown the proper steps to get to where I want, I'll be golden"" which I realize is not the case in real life. 

I'd just like any and all advice from you lovely people on how to stop being dependent on my parents, how to be more educated outside of what I already know, and what to do to become accomplished and realistic about the rest of my life.",Adulting101,Small steps for huge payoffs?,0.0

My parents still take care of a lot for me, but it’s not laziness—it’s because I have mild autism, and a lot of things in life are just confusing. I only have the time and energy for a part-time campus job, with the stress of becoming an adult, making it through a day like a neurotypical person without losing my shit, keeping friendships, passing classes, and things other people find easy. It’s not fun having to read my textbook chapter five times to pass the quizzes in class, or never knowing if I’ll wake up feeling normal. Sorry about the rants, I’m just trying to explain in case I sound lazy.

I’ve figured that the only way to make it out of this slump is to save...not to make money, because I can’t make that happen yet, but to save and sell art at home. What do you cut back on first to save money? Also, what kind of art will make the most? I can’t be relying on my parents forever.

I (18F) am about to start college and am currently looking for a full-time job (though where I live its difficult with the pandemic going on). 

My mother likes to go on (whats the word? Thing professors do when they talk the whole time). And in one of these moments, she talked about how she is going to label me as a dependent on her credit card to up my credit score (my idea, thanks internet!)  But once I move out I'm going to have to get my own credit card.

She told me that I'll need to pay over my minimum every month, and that car dealerships, insurance companies, and the likes will look at your credit score and give you your numbers based off that.

(Edited for clarity: she told me I'm only to use my credit card for emergencies with like $200 on it, but to me you could just use a savings account right?)

I know some of the history of how credit cards started and essentially what they do, but to me it just doesn't add up to being a good investment for me? I don't enjoy spending money, and the idea of going into debt just to show im really hood at not being in debt seems a little ridiculous to me.

I've seen some older adults on here who say they never even touched a credit card, so it should be possible, right?

Is it even possible to do this without my sister having to get involved? If i refinance with a different company, what will happen to my current account with the company i have now? I'm have literally zero experience in this as i was never really taught by anyone on how this all works. Thank you in advance for your time!",Adulting101,I need help with refinancing my car loan,0.0

Hi, I'm 18-19 and trying to move out asap - I've made a couple posts like this before asking similar questions, but I guess I'm just completely lost on what to do. 

I've been trying to set up a savings account in secret which my parents wouldn't have access to, except that to finish verifying my information, I need to submit front-and-back pictures of my driver's license (which I have) and my social security card (which happens to be missing).

I've checked in a few places already and from what I remember when my dad and I recently just got the card replaced, I think he said ""he would hold onto it"", as he wouldn't trust me with something as important as that (though I also have a couple of other ideas as to where the card might be). 

I thought I would go over to [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) and log in, just to see if MAYBE I could find a copy of my card there that I could print out (probably can't do that though) 

Except before logging me in they asked me to confirm my phone number - which is actually set to my DAD'S cell, and I'm pretty sure I would get into HUGE trouble if I changed it, especially without bothering to tell him.

Also if I tried to log in, wouldn't his cell phone notify him about this? I mean if so, I could just say I was curious as to where my card was because I simply ""don't remember"", but I don't want to be suspicious about it in any way.

Plus if I casually asked my dad if I could just switch his cell on the site over to mine, he might not even LET me - I can't turn to my mom, she's x1000 times worse and is always over-suspicious that I could possibly be hiding something from her, so she would just make everything worse. 

And yes, I could simply switch his cell over to mine without his permission, but I'm way too scared to even do that. Again, I'd get into HUGE trouble if/when my parents found out and they'd make my life into a living hell (again, especially if I didn't bother to tell them about this). My mom's narcissistic (pretty sure my e-dad is too), so I have to act like I'm NOT trying really hard to become independent and all that. I can't be suspicious in the slightest.

I just don't know how to go about this and I'll really appreciate any feedback you guys might have.

So what's going on is that I'm trying to move out as soon as possible, but I'm kind of worried about whether I've already made too much money that now they'd have to be included in my parents' taxes, even though it's definitely under $600. I counted it all, it's about $420.

Since I'm filed as a dependent and my parents would have to fill the taxes out themselves, honestly I'm scared to tell my dad I've been using all these random survey sites (including stuff like the cocoon browser, microsoft rewards, etc). He'd probably tell my mom about it and then my mom would find it suspicious and ""weird"". She's just always over-suspicious that I could be hiding something from her. That's how she is. I know it isn't normal, hence one of the many reasons why I'm trying to move out soon.

I tried looking up whether in the U.S. you have to report all income in your taxes even if it's under $600 (literally one Turbotax forum is all I could find after looking it up, nothing else) and the forum said yes. 

But thinking about it, from what my dad taught me (when I asked him to show me how to do taxes) you have three years to go back and fix them. 

I'm thinking that if I don't report my income this year from this little saving-up-money-spree I've been on for months, I could do it within the next three years and I would be fine. I also don't think I would have to rely on my parents to help me and I could just report the income myself within these next three years because then I wouldn't be filed as a dependent anymore.

Am I right or am I wrong??? Am I screwed and I'd have to tell my parents, or should I be fine as long as I report the income within the next three years and keep making sure my income is under $600?

I really just don't know how to go about this and I really hope I don't have to tell my parents about what I'm doing, so any help is appreciated.

My mom has been in the hospital since August 2019. She has COPD and had a quadruple bypass due to a random skipping heart. She was discharged to a rehabilitation center and caught Staph in her chest wound within a day at that dirty place.  So she went back to hospital and just got reassigned to a new rehab center. 

She's been there 2 weeks and is barely standing up, so she needs more time. But Medicaid is asking for bank statements because they think she's running out of coverage after 2 weeks. Her social security back pay just came in at 12k. The Medicaid lady told me she can't have over 2k in the account.

Because of the back pay can they take away her Medicaid? 
Can I somehow transfer some of the money out and have a legitimate reason for that much disappearing? 
She's been out of work for a year due to this illness and that little back pay might screw us, I need help.",Adulting101,Mother on Medicaid and SSI back pay just came in.,0.0

Ok so my friend currently has a very bad, dead end life and my parents and I have offered to have her live with us for a while. She is 21 and lives in Maine, we live in New Jersey. How does she like move herself to here and get work, health insurance, etc? She also has certain prescription medicine she needs and I'm not sure how she can get it. She will likely find work, but I'd also like suggestions if not if there are any as a plan B. Personally none of us involved have never moved to another state, so we have no idea what to do here. We are all Covid free, and my dad will have been vaccinated by the time this happens as he is at risk and scheduled, but we probably will get us all a test to be certain.

I’m just looking for some advice
I’m moving out on my own for the first time and I’m worriedI've been looking into apartments and I haven’t found anything I liked I tried a couple places but nothing caught my eye. the place one place that I wanted in the beginning said I didn't make enough now I have a second job and I resubmitted an application now they are saying I make too much for the 60% deduction and now I only get 80% deduction.  I expected my rent to be 800 because that's how much my friends is ( he lives there). If I were to move in my rent would be 1090 not including electric.  I'm honestly in love with this place but I'm kind of worried because its completely out of my budget and I wasn't expecting it to cost this much. This would be my first apartment, it comes with everything else included, a gym, security, state of the art stainless steal appliances, laundry, rooftop lounge and it very spacious. I'm also buying my first car as a Christmas gift to myself so lets add in my car insurance to that as well😭 What should I do? also is it normal for income based housing to calculate your gross income rather then the money your bringing in? I’ve been saving my money all of covid and I have 6,500 saved up Im going to buy this car for 1,200 + insurance+ registration so let’s just say I have 4000 saved. Is that good enough?

Tldr I got into it with my folks and I might have fucked up by saying I hated them but they really have been nothing but nonces for reasons I won't get into but my dad is childish and loud and never takes anything serious until he has too my mom holds grudges and get hurt to easily and my dad also likes to think he knows everything and he is influcing my mom to kick me out potentially.

 But what really sealed the deal was when my uncle told me that my mom is the type to hold a grudge it didn't shock me badly but it made me feel like a fool so I changed my approaches for my mom and dad as I been going about in my own house to care free now I may or may not get kicked out of my own home i have to pay for my own phone bill and internet in the house.

So here's a question I have a phone plan and cellphone covered what's a good cheap internet plan to get in my house as they already have internet covering the house but my dad insisted I get my own because come next month hes kicking me of the wifi. My budget has to be 30-40 bucks for internet as I am working a part time job cleaning in my parents business its a twice a week gig that I work two hours for two days in a week tops and I get paid bi weekly.my final check is either 80-85 dollars max.

I have multiple bank accounts for groceries($25) monthly bills($25) room fees and deposits($25) and an emergency account($25) this was money from my dwindling savings which is below $100 now. And my current savings account will be my hobbies account but right now I am going to community college and I am taking one English class.

How much food can I get for $65 dollars that can feed me for 2-3 weeks breakfast and lunch only for  now. I also have tech certs from CompTIA Security+ Network+ and A+ so I am wondering what jobs can I get with 5 months experience in the it and cybersecurity field respectfully I tried the air force but I have asthma and they won't let me join unless I take a pft test which is the last thing I want to do as I really need a good government job working in IT or infosec (cybersecurity)so I can get my TS clearance.

Second question would it be wise to rent a room or rent with a roommate if I do end up getting kicked out. I have a therapist who gives me ideas and is a life coach but I feel like i can't utilize him well due to the nature of my situation. 

I also don't have a driver's license I drove a little bit but it's a been a while so I will need to practice when I can. But my main goal is to move from michigan to washington dc but I need some way to make more money than I am now as tried fiverr and it was too slow for me and I work on wednesdays and Fridays. if you have ways to make money online that have a flexible schedule let me know I am willing to learn it most likely.

 I will come up with more questions later on but I need your help to get all this stuff figured out in 4 months before I get potentially kicked out.  If you read this all the way your a g and I await to hear your advice.

Yeah that's the tldr of my situation it's a mess but so is life if you have more questions about my life just dm or ask in the comments and I will see what I can do.

I have never purchased a dishwasher before and long story short, need to buy it, have it installed and ready to function within the next two weeks. 

How long is the process? How does it work? Do I just go to Lowe’s and pick out a brand? Do I have to measure how big my dishwasher is now or are they all the same size?

He used to go in his home country as a kid and has great memories of it. We didn’t have them where I grew up so I have no idea what the etiquette is, how to find your spot, how to get back out. The whole thing sounds like parallel parking in public but paying for the privilege. I don’t get it. 

The whole concept freaks me out. What happens if I drive the wrong way down an aisle? Are the aisles? Are there allocated spots? What if I can’t fit into it? 

For context my husband doesn’t know how to drive and can only refer to the overseas childhood memories of the set up, which mostly consist of snacks, so I’m in the dark. Additionally where we live other drivers love to honk horns, yell at you and cut you off for breathing, so I’m not anticipating a calm peaceful environment. 

Can someone de mystify the process? 

I know this seems like something super easy and trivial I should just deal with but it does freak me out. I love to know the rules so I can at least be prepared and not ruin what could be a really nice experience.

Educate yourself to stay well-informed &amp; practice financial management with these guidelines. You can read more at [NeuCommunity Blog](https://www.neucommunity.neuxp.com/post/manage-your-personal-finance-the-right-way).  


1. ***Acknowledge your financial status and any financial problem***   
 Understand where your position is financially by knowing what problems you have whether it’s debt or your savings. By creating a list of  your assets (the things you own) and liabilities (the things you owe), you’ll know how to strategize and improve your finance. 
2. ***Understand your cash flow***  
Determine how much you earn and spend monthly by subtracting your total expenses from your total income for the month. If your result ends up negative, it means you spent more than you made. It's time to take  additional steps to best manage your money.
3. ***List down and start your personal finance goals***  
It’s better to start with short-term goals for less stress rather than starting off with huge goals without understanding what your personal financial situation is at. 
4. ***Create a budget***  
 Apply the 50/30/20 [budget principles](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/budget-checklists-for-the-diy-budgeter/): 50% toward needs, 30% toward wants and 20% toward savings and debt repayment.  
○ 50% for NEEDs: Groceries, insurance, credit cards, utilities, mortgage, etc.  
○ 30% for WANTS: Netflix subscriptions, Spotify premium, phone bills, eating out, etc.  
○ 20% for SAVINGS: Debt repayments, emergency funds, investments, etc.
5. ***Make use of tool or personal finance app***  
Start using money management apps if you haven’t as it comes with professional tools that can make personal budgeting easy and hassle-free.
6.  ***Set aside Emergency Funds or Savings***  
Put money aside for what’s important first. Have a separate account from a      bank account you use daily, so you’re not tempted to utilize it. 
7.  ***Include Insurance coverage***   
The longer you wait, the higher your premiums go up according to your age. It’s best to encourage savings by reducing your expenses in the long run. You can avoid payments for unfortunate events.
8. ***Save for*** ***Retirement***  
Save 10 to 15 percent for retirement. With a savings target, it helps you  approximately how much you should set aside over time to meet your retirement goals that will allow you to enjoy your golden years.
9. ***Seek advice or money management resources***  
For the best track of your financial plan, it’s better to ensure you seek help from a financial advisor so that you wouldn’t miss the tiny details that could significantly affect your plan.

Last night while parking in front of my boyfriend’s house for the 5000th time, I hit a parked car. He lives on a semi-busy street in not the best neighborhood and I usually parallel park. I was waiting to pick him up and we were in a hurry to be somewhere on time. It was a large space that I tried to pull straight into, but I turned too sharply and scraped my passenger side door on their front right bumper. My car got the brunt of the damage, which was made worse when I panicked when I realized I had hit them and not so gracefully reversed. My whole right side got scratched up and the door is dented, but in an area I think it can be popped out. Anyway. 

The driver was no where to be seen. I left a note and took pictures. A woman saw me and said it was her friend’s car, but made it seem like he would not be back for a while? She was very nice and made it seem like not a big deal and was very gracious that I left a note. This was almost 24 hours ago and I haven’t heard from them yet. 

I however have a semi-new car and though I have a spotless driving record and am meticulously responsible I somehow manage to always drive into stationary things, and have bad luck with other drivers. The damage on my car will definitely cost more than I can afford to pay out of pocket. 

The kicker is that I am 27 and still on my fathers insurance and he is your typical boomer and I am his typical over educated yet failed to launch millennial daughter. I have just recently secured my first Good Job (decent) after completing my masters and finally moved out on my own, underpaid yet scraping by. My car is a few years old but I bought it in near perfect condition and over the 3 years I’ve had it, this shit just always happens to me (though this is the first time I’ve hit another vehicle). 

Can I call myself to submit the claim.....do I wait until the other driver calls me first........do I even have to tell my dad? That really is the worst part. I would pay out of pocket if it meant not facing his wrath of disappointment.

I wouldn’t say we love it here but it has enough positives that we signed our lease for another year. A week ago I went back home to visit and take a little vacation. I planned for a week. The day I arrived my family said a week was too short and they said reconsider staying a little longer. (As I am currently unemployed ) I didn’t necessarily want to as I scheduled everything I wanted to do for the week but agreed just to please them and get them off my back. I felt bad because my girlfriend and I drove up together with our 3 dogs. So me staying longer meant they would have to drive back alone. I felt really bad but luckily she was understanding and they made it back safely. During my trip back, I’ve had multiple family members “talk” to me about what they think i am unhappy and blame it on my girlfriend and the distance. (For the record, I am not depressed or anything like that, I am just at a crossroads and am looking for direction) I had to remind them all that their is still a pandemic hence why I do not go out and do all these activities they are suggesting I don’t do anymore and it’s making me unhappy. They seemed unfazed as that’s not an excuse on why they think I’m unhappy. Even my dad had a long talk on why I should move back there and even work for them for the family business. But I do not want to move back at least for another 5+ years as I want to keep exploring new cities. I told every family member that and my girlfriend that every time it comes up. I never once caved and said ok I’ll move back. This little vacation ended up being a more anxiety/stress ridden then I was hoping for say the least. I do not want to disappoint my family but at the same time they make me frustrated as I just want to live my life.

I’m not close to either of my parents and neither of them are great examples of adults, so I guess I’ll be asking here about what I should do 

I was living at my college from January to August by doing work study, but I had to leave since I decided on going to trade school instead. Now I’ve been living at my mothers for a week, but I can’t stay here permanently since she has government assisted housing due to her mental illness. 

My job is an hour away which equals 100 miles on my car there and back. The job starts at 7:30am and ends around 5:30pm. 


I start this Monday and I’m thinking of staying at an Airbnb for $269 for 5 days so that I can be close to my job and don’t have to worry about commuting and can see if it’d be worth getting my own place out there. 

I’ll be getting paid $15 an hour on the books, but I don’t know how much will be deducted from tax or how much I’ll be getting weekly to truly calculate how much I’ll be making and what kind of apartment I could afford (I live in Long Island, New York) , which is why I’m debating on living at air bnbs instead of an apartment OR just staying at the Airbnb for a week. 

I’m not sure what to do, I feel like this all comes down to whether I want to save time or money. 

I can either commute a total of 10 hours per week and save $269 from not staying at an airbnb, but have to pay about $40 in gas and put around 400 miles on my car per week and get up at 5am while stressing about being late 

Or get up around 6am, be right near my job, but have to pay close to $300 on a place to stay for 5 days.

I don’t have much guidance from my parents and am figuring out all this adulting stuff on my own so maybe a little guidance from this sub would help 

So I went to college for half a semester and decided it wasn’t right for me and that I wanted to become an electrician. 

I signed myself up for two online classes (only option) at a trade school and will be certified with OSHA within the next month. Today I got accepted to work for an electric company and am super excited, but I’m not sure what to do after. I’m starting as a helper as I’m completely new and am getting paid $15 an hour on the books and I live in New York.

And it’s really expensive to find a place out here, although I do have a mattress in my car. 

I start this job Monday, but what happens after? I just work for the rest of my life? I commute everyday to work and practically revolve around it? I feel like only 2 weeks off in a year isn’t enough for people to actually live. I guess maybe I’m scared of becoming an adult and only working.
