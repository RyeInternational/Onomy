Alright....I'm sure that this won't be well received but I want to know what people think of 'Velocity Banking' (best video I've seen is titled The Method on YouTube), whether it works or not, scam/not a scam, and then finally how it compares to just taking your monthly surplus and simply putting it into the market.

Quick background, 35 yo, own a house (but will be selling within 6 months to move to Japan), wife and 1 child. Only debt we have is the mortgage and our monthly spending (no CC, no car payments). 

Quick Financials:
Checking/Savings-16,000
Vanguard IRA/Brokerage-26,000
TSP(Combined)-120,000
Currently have about $500/mo extra (I'm deployed currently, TSP set at 60%), when I get back I'll scale it back and will have more like $1500-2000/mo free.

Feel like we're doing well but would just love to see some conversation for or against Velocity Banking vs Investing vs anything else. Let's open it up.",financialindependence,Velocity Banking,0

The Guap strategy is to “fund, support, and circulate amongst its own merchant network that rewards consumers for supporting community businesses, grassroots organizations, and HBCUs.”  The idea behind the Guap network (which has yet to be revealed) is that participating black-owned businesses will accept Guap coins, allowing for real-world usage.  The coins can then be saved and spent at other merchant locations within the network.

It is is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency created to promote economic growth and wealth. GUAP is about community economics and building a strong foundation or basis for long-term economic wealth particularly for the underserved communities like those of the Black &amp; Brown Community. They are not limiting their services to those communities, nor do they seek to exclude any other community. However, from their standpoint – they have to begin with these communities because that is where they can have the greatest positive impact on the entire world. They are solving for the economic obstacles that prevent them from taking full advantage of technical, blockchain, and FinTech innovations.

I was Sr Director at a large CPG company in the midwest.   Salary was 185 and 30% average bonus and some good stock option / grants.   I was vesting grants of roughly $40K a year, with a stock price 30% below all time highs.   I was in the Operations area ... plant management, supply chain, project management stuff.    Just under 20 years at the company. 

I managed my own job reduction so that i received the package.   The package was 40 weeks of pay and vacation.   I also picked up unemployment for 20 weeks ...that was only worth $8K.  

The leave plan was executed perfectly ... it took about 9 months of planning and conversations with some decent timing as a backdrop.    Big companies are always looking for cost reduction projects and i was able to add myself on to a larger project.   Being somewhere for 20 years and knowing most everyone made this somewhat easy but i also was in a role that could eliminated without a major reorganization of responsibilities.

I had about $1.2 MM liquid, $1.4 MM 401K / IRA, and $800K in deferred income ... payable over 10 years (roughly $80K a year).   All in all $3.4MM.   Wife has health insurance for the family and makes about $20K in a part time role.   3 kids ... oldest kids were just getting into college.  80% of the total college anticipated costs were accounted for.   With good returns i would not have to add to the 3rd kids college.   Basically needed $300K and had $220K.   As I type this, I'm still about $50k short but i have 3 years before i need the first installment for the 3rd child.  

Lessons learned in no particular order.   

Don't count on your friends having time during the work week.   I thought i would be able to grab a few more beers mid week with one of my buddies during the work week.   That never really worked ... guys who are working all week and have kids never have much time during the week.  

More exercise time ... yea, it's true but I worked out a lot before i left the job.  Outside of never missing a workout ... i didn't workout more or get healthier because i didn't work.  

Less stress ... yea, it is less stressful but you find other ways to get stressed.   However, this was a win, no question.    

Positive surprises -  I have spent more time with the kids.  That's all good.  Also, feel like i enjoyed more days of the week.   Enjoy my friends a little more.

I own 49.9% Now i work about 80% in a company with big growth opportunities and i should make about $40K a year.   A little stressful though as i'm dealing unwinding a few contractors from the business.   Legal stuff and then watching the customers to see if they stay with us.  Not sure how long i'll stay in the business.   At least another year.   I like it but not much $ considering the work right now.   I can probably sell my share for another $10K or so.

My employer makes a generous contribution to a profit sharing plan on behalf of employees (~7% of total compensation) which I am grateful for. Based on my conversation with management and some research into the matter, employee contributions are not possible, however. 

Does anyone have any knowledge or insight as to why a profit sharing plan would be preferable to my employer than, say, offering a 401(k) plan so that employees could also contribute up to the annual limits?

We've made some real small-time progress and I'm very proud of us, but we've constantly struggled to grow our savings account before something wipes it out. We've yo-yo'ed between 1-2 months emergency funds during this process constantly, while making some progress on debts. So overall, forward motion!

Flash forward to today. Due to the sad reality of Covid-19 America,  I'm furloughed and her hours have been cut in half. I've been drawing unemployment since my furlough began (first time ever in my life) and she just got her first unemployment deposits today. Due to the CARES act, we're making significantly more income in this situation than we were while working. As a result, we've been banking a lot of extra cash (for us).

Today we surpassed the largest amount we've ever saved up before (previously held by the amount we'd saved for our wedding) and we are now sitting on close to 6 months worth of Emergency funds! And for the current bill period we're already completely solvent and expecting additional payments this week! 0.o 

It feels very strange. Wife feels guilty. I'm not without a bit of guilt, but I'm also not one to look a gift horse in the mouth when it is setting my family up to come out of this pandemic stronger than ever before. We are grateful everyday to be healthy and able to stay solvent(+) during these times. I won't wish for more, but I will be grateful for what I can. I'm not pleased as punch about what brought us here, but I'm going to celebrate this silver lining all the same. Life gave us some lemonade. 

To try and pay it forward, we've been extending some of our good fortune to friends/family who haven't been as lucky (some still holding for their first checks over 8 weeks!). We know a lot of folks out there are struggling for various reasons to pay bills, stay sane, and keep food in the house. It isn't much, but we can take care to make sure our neighbors pay rent/bills and get to eat. And we still get to make incredible progress towards a stronger financial situation.

Who knows what the future holds? We're still in the early stages of financial growth, but I've learned a lot spending time in this sub. We're careful not to touch our 401k's and the like, even though we don't contribute as much as we would like (yet).

Our plan is to hit the 6 month dollar mark and then aggressively pay down debts. Depending on how long this situation goes on, we may even be able to start investigating whether we should/will purchase our first home! 

I couldn't have done it without the motivation this sub has given me. I don't know if I'll ever achieve financial independence or get to retire early, but I feel more optimistic than I probably should be allowed to (given a pandemic) that we've got a chance!

I come from a blue collar family and it was drilled into from an early age to go to college and finish a degree. Following the advice of my parents, I enrolled in college but always felt like it wasn’t for me. Ultimately, I decided to pick up a job as a plumber’s helper between semesters of my sophomore year and haven’t looked back since. 

Since then: 
I’ve been lucky enough to continue with my parents and build up a little nest egg. (Almost at my 2 year mark of working full time). 

$16000 in a Roth IRA 
$9000 in a taxable brokerage 
$18000 in a high yield savings account. 
(I’m currently 100% in Schwab etfs, no bonds) 

Although I have a decent nest egg for a 22 year old, I am beginning to worry about my future. My dream has always been to run my own construction company, so the goal is to eventually attain a master’s plumber license. 

However, my main concern is that NYC is becoming increasingly unaffordable. For example,  my parents purchased our house in 2000 for $260,000. After a full rehab inside and out 10 years ago, the house is worth over $1m. Houses in the neighborhood (and the entire city) have drastically appreciated to the point where it seems impossible for a blue collar worker like myself to purchase one. If I did, it would be a lifetime financial burden. 

I’m fortunate enough to have a good relationship with my family, but I don’t want to live with them forever. By renting an apartment, I would be spending way over 30% of my monthly take home pay on rent, not including groceries, bills, etc. 

I absolutely love the trades and plumbing, so I don’t plan on switching. I’m just worried that this city will continue to price me out and the FIRE will be out of my grasp. 

Are there any tradesmen/women in this community who could share some advice. Maybe I should consider moving to a more affordable city where plumbing is in high demand.. I’m just not sure where to go from here on out.",financialindependence,Is FIRE feasible for me? (Blue collar NYC),0

Long story short, I believe I now only have one conceivable path to achieve FI by age 50 and RE by age 55.

Here is the situation:

I am 35 years old.  I have an AAS degree in computer programming and a BS in political science.  (I also have several IT certifications that I keep current, but never tried to get into the IT industry.)  

I work as a probation officer in a southern state for 43K a year.  I get 1K/year annual salary increases up to a max of 50K.  I have held this job since age 24.

I am in a state wide pension system.  I qualify for an enhanced ""law enforcement/public safety"" pension.  Because I qualify for this enhanced pension, and the fact I got in so young, I can take an early retirement at age 50 and draw $3000/month OR I can wait until age 55 and draw $5500/month.  I also qualify for retiree health insurance, so I will have that as well.  Our pension system reports that it is currently 98% funded, and independent audits rate it as extremely strong.  I believe it will be there for me in 15 to 20 years.

Part of me wants to go change industries and get into IT... but, I feel that I have sunk so much time into this probation officer job at this point, that my only real (basically 100% guaranteed path) to FIRE is to just stay in my current job until retirement.  

Basically, I will achieve FI at age 50 and RE at age 55.  It's possible I could do a full FIRE at age 50, but it would be pretty risky.

The problem, however, is that in the meantime, I make a pretty low salary... that basically will stay low my entire career.  I live a pretty minimalist lifestyle due to my low salary.  I have zero debt due to my lifestyle.  (I mean that literally - no debt of any kind.). I will also inherit a 250K paid for house from my parents at some point in the future.

So, my question is - should I just stay where I am and ride it out for the pension, or gamble everything and try to get into another field such as IT where I could potentially make a much higher salary eventually?

I appreciate any advice!",financialindependence,Is this my only path to achieve FI by age 50 and RE by age 55?,0

I thought she might be able to create a secret account one with online statements and the such and spoke to td bank about it. Td bank said that although statements would be online they would still send offers for credit cards and the such to the address listed on the account. And that there is no way to stop that. I just feel lost on how to help my friend through this if she doesn't have a safe space to store the money that she earns.

Does anyone know of any banks in the NYC area that would are more willing to create a secret account with.

I just fear that there's people that'll be after my money in the future, whether it'd be a crazy mother-in-law, fake gold-digging friends, or some people back in high school who just want to sue you after finding out you got rich etc, etc. 

\^Also, by no means am I wealthy atm, nor was I born with a silver spoon (more like a plastic spoon that's been half chewed and cracked in half) but I have plans in place to reach and surpass FIRE in the coming years. This post is just a question that's been on my mind for a while.

**TL;DR**

Would you suggest setting up some sort of LLC or Corp before starting to invest in any market, and if so, what baby steps would you recommend we start with? (stuff to google? talk to a certain type of lawyer? etc.)

* Just for some background I’m 25 years old, married, and since February 2020 I've been trying to learn about investing so I can be financially secure in the future. I served 5 years in the military and was medically discharged in 2019. I have been unemployed since then. I currently receive $2,951.30 in disability pay from the VA but I am unable to work due to my disabilities. Our monthly expenses are approximately $1,200. I have $22k between checking/saving. 3 CD's totaling $33k, and an M1 Finance taxable investment account with $2,200.

FI Plan:
* We investing $500 bi-weekly. My portfolio is 85% VTI, 15% VXUS and I will possibly add a bond fund in 20-25 years. I plan on reinvesting all dividends and dollar cost averaging through all ups and downs of the market for the next 30 years, if not longer. My reasoning is that because I have disability pay for life and it's more than enough to cover my cost of living expenses, I'm okay with the fluctuations I'll inevitably see. As long as I see my money grow and it can be utilized if need be in 30 years.

* I also have a traditional Thrift Savings Plan with $5,700 but am unable to contribute because I don't have earned income and I'm no longer a federal employee. My plan is to avoid early withdrawal fees and roll it over to a Roth IRA with Vanguard (100% VTSAX, reinvest dividends, and add a bond allocation down the road). 

* I'm still on the fence about opening a Roth IRA since having future earned income to contribute can't be guaranteed. And because of this I've considered withdrawing all $5,700, taking the penalty fees and reinvest what I’m left with.",financialindependence,New Investor FI Strategy,0

I sometimes wonder if my life would be significantly better with more luxury. I have gotten to almost 50 living kind of like a college student. I drive a 2004 used car, have never owned a home, wear shirts that were Christmas presents from 20 years ago, essentially all our furniture is found or hand-me-downs, we eat out maybe once every three months, we rent a so-so house in a so-so area, I bargain shop and fret about purchases for months or even years, etc. 

Because of all this, I've thought of myself as more in the ""leanFIRE"" category and was glad to think I could get by without working fewer years. Imagine a childless couple getting by on $30k to $35k/yr on average (including rent cost). However, I wonder if I am being foolish in not enjoying the *somewhat* finer things of life at least somewhat more?  I'll never need a swimming pool, but a ""funner"" home (in a higher COL area), less bargain shopping, more musical gadgets, more trips, more restaurants, etc. may be worth working for more, at least some.

The author recommends to invest in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund (VTSAX) and states that when you can live off the dividends VTSAX provides, you are financially free. Does anyone here do this? Do you think the author here is specifically talking about a taxable brokerage account that isn't a Roth IRA? If so, how much would someone realistically need in their account to be receiving enough dividends to essentially live off of (I know location and lifestyle are a huge factor)? Even with $25k in my Roth IRA I'll only see an extra hundred dollars or so pop up in dividends every now and then, so I can't even fathom what this author is referring to.

I don't see a lot of EU people talking about their current situation with NW and their road to fire. First of all, apologies for my english. 

I'm married, I'm 33 years old and I'm from Poland (albeit not working there but want to FIRE in Poland) and together we have 1M PLN in liquid (220k euro). Our Net worth is a bit higher because we have a paid off flat (value: 400k pln ) and no liabilities at all.

I know it is not much for German, UK or French standards but for Poland's that's the leanfire level. And I'm not even comparing myself to US colleagues that are 10x ahead with some NW of 1M USD by 27 or having 2 triplexes or 4 cars.

I didn't take into account any social securities because I don't believe *I will receive* any. In 30 years the whole pension system will be dead and buried and I won't see even a dime from the taxes I pay right now.

With a swr of 3% and the capital gain tax in Poland of 19% (and a 2% inflation) we can live off to 75 on 2,000 pln net monthly. [calculator used](https://financialmentor.com/calculator/best-retirement-calculator)

- **leanfire** barrier is 2,000 pln (440 euro). I have to pay 700 pln for the flat and utilities, 1,000 for food, 300 for emergencies.

- The **FIRE** level would be 8,000 net per month (1,700 euro). It means working until 41-42. 

- **FatFIRE** (for us at least) would be 15,000 net per month. (3,200 euro) It would take almost 8,5M PLN in investments and stay employed until 47 (if we assume today's salary)... :(

As a ~~downfall~~ windfall we will probably inherit a big house in city center (value: 3-4M pln that maybe we will sell to be closedr to fatFIRE number) and 2 flats (to rent)

Both of us are working in banking in Western Europe since about a year. I won't lie, this move helped us quite a lot. We were able to double our savings in a year (compared to 5 years in Poland) and increase our value on the market. 

Our saving rate is around 75-80% as we are DINKS and we live very frugally. No dinning out, no expensive holidays, no car, no latest gadgets and in general we try to ""lay low"".

Biggest challenges ahead:

- Climate collapse in the next 10 to 20 years. [Future is grim](https://medium.com/@cache_86525/the-future-is-grim-27ca6f7ab07b)
- Kids? We are on the fence because firstly we don't believe that the future will be better. We will see an end to privacy, rise in protests, authoritarian countries, wars and global collapse. Secondly, kids are a big financial burden. But we would love to have someone to share our passions and world views.
- Poland becoming a non-democratic country and devaluation of PLN (the real 6-8% inflation is already eating out some of our savings and the recession isn't helping)
- Automation that will take out our job. It is quite menial and quite easy to automate.
- unplanned emergency like illness. 

If I missed anything let me know!

Edit:

Expenses:
800 euro flat, 500 euro food, 300 euro for stuff (cloths, dry cleaning, travel, bus)

Only a portion of our taxable funds are gains.  Thus, even in the worst case scenario of drawing everything from a taxable account, my 'income' would likely be less than half my actual draw.  It's possible draw a very comfortable amount and only realize a taxable income a fraction of that.  That makes us eligible for larger subsidies, and lowers the cost of health insurance.

So, it's great that ACA marketplace plans are (relatively) affordable for us, but affordability is nothing if the plans themselves aren't good.

I make 42k per year working as a therapist on an ACT team, which is a program that serves people with the most severe kinds of mental health issues and life circumstances. I mostly like and prefer this population, and when I’ve worked with higher functioning populations (the kinds that would be more likely to be able to pay at a private practice), I’ve just found myself less interested, less inspired. To make money as a mental health counselor I’d have to get out of non profit agencies, and instead open up a private practice - and the self promotion aspect of this really turns me off. Before going into mental health I did all kinds of stuff: warehouse, factory, manual labor, line cook, dishwasher, retail, librarian. I even wrote a shitty novel that I was pretty sure was going to get published and make money (lol). As much as I like helping people, I’m tired of being broke all the time. I’m eligible for PSLF,  but it honestly doesn’t even seem worth it, and I’m thinking about a career change. I’m thinking about takin nursing predeqs at community college and then transferring into an accelerated bachelor to RN program which will take 1 very full time year and will also come with a 50% surcharge on top of tuition because according to the public university system here (UNC), I have too many credits.   I’m drawn to this because its more concrete and scientific, I would be making more money which is probably the most important thing to me (I’ve come to realize). I also feel like my family doesn’t appreciate what i do...I’ve had my own struggles in the past with mental health, and i think they look at my current career as a joke bc its not STEM, or like I’m fraud due to my own past struggles with mental health. I also think nursing is more prestigious or its “smarter” than a mental health therapist - I guess that sounds shallow but maybe its just a sign that I don’t feel challenged or like I’m not utilizing skills I value.  However as an Rn, I could even go back into mental health as an RN, and continue to get more education and become an advanced practice nurse - either psychiatric, or some other specialty.  The other option is totally different - I was thinking about coding or cyber security. The main thing that interests me is again money, and the STEM prestige/challenge, and that my girlfriend is considering a career shift away from architecture and into coding and and i was thinking we could learn it together. I’ve been trying to learn about wireshark the last week or so and its been blowing my mind - I love the idea of doing this, but I’m worried maybe I wont be able to do it or it will take too much work and I’m too far behind and will be competing with 20 somethings who’ve been doing this since they were 12. I’m 33, which isn’t super old, but I feel like I do need to start thinking about that. I also like the idea that maybe I wouldn’t even have to go back to a university to study and could instead learn what I need from community college or even free online classes. I think becoming a nurse would be a lot easier and more straightforward, but programming or cyber security seems really creative, and I think I could possibly make a lot more. Sorry if this a long ramble, I just kind of stumbled across this subreddit and its made me think more about this stuff...based on what I’ve said which option makes more sense? I’m tired of money always being so tight, I need to start making moves. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks in advance.",financialindependence,Coding or cyber security or nursing,0

I am 21 years old and am a sophomore in college, majoring in computer science. I have $10,000 in student loans (sub / unsubscribes), $10,000 in credit card debt (5 credit cards, all mid-tier), and a $20,000 car loan (6% interest), and no real job.

I get it, it's rough. I'm working on it. Anyways. This past semester has been complete crap because I haven't been putting in the effort to make good grades. My computer science professor loves me, and I've even been able to do a mini lecture for the class. I'm also tutoring my fellow students, and am really happy. I look forward to one day maybe being in the CS field because I know there's potential.

Now, the reason I've had bad grades this semester. I've started a business. I love marketing my services, working on my website, working on my own, and just being able to specialize in something. I've got customers lined up, and I love that people are really interested in what I do. I'm averaging $30-$50/hr, and it's starting to expand after all of the work I've been putting into it.

I love my business, and I don't want to work at a part-time job, especially while in college. My question is, how do I know when I should just drop out of school and focus on this, if that's what I really want to do. Or, is that just a stupid idea and should I just focus on school? Is this a dumb idea, and should I just get a college degree? Or maybe is it not so dumb, and should I just do both? How do I balance my business, and school if so? 

Really confused! Thanks for all the responses.",financialindependence,"Stay in school, focus on my business, or both?",0

And since credit isn’t taught in schools, most people don’t know about these two massive benefits that come with excellent credit.

Before I tell you about these two things, consider how important your credit score is to your life.

Today your credit score affects the place you’ll live, the car you’ll buy...and where you work. 

So it’s in your best interest to find a way to boost and maintain your credit score as high as possible.

And at the end, I’ll tell you where you can learn all about this and more.

So what are the two things most people miss out on when it comes to credit?

Traveling for free and getting funding for their business.

There are certain cards you that give you more miles than other cards. (Up to 1.5X more)

And there’s a way to strategically use those cards so you’re always stacking miles and points.

Next, is business credit.

Learning about business credit is crucial. Every giant company you can think of - Amazon, Wal-Mart, Disney - all use business credit strategically.

And once you learn how to use business credit…

You’ll be able to fund your business without using any of your own money. 

These are all the things you can learn...AND more...inside Tai Lopez’s Credit Mentor program.

I’ve been a member of the program for awhile now and have been applying these strategies for myself. 

And I’m already seeing some serious results.

I disagree with that, especially for FIRE-seekers with portfolios many times larger than annual expenses. 

Instead, all extra cash can be invested according to your typical asset allocation. Assuming a large enough portfolio, this strategy can mitigate the downside risk by selling investments to cover expenses in case of emergency. But the real differentiator is that it also maximizes the upside. By having more money invested, you will end up with a greater net worth over time.

Of course, this strategy is only viable if you have a portfolio that can take a hit and still cover your expenses in an emergency. If you haven’t yet reached that point, saving in a more traditional emergency fund is beneficial. But if you’ve started to accumulate some wealth, you’re better off without an emergency fund.


**What is an emergency fund?**

The general purpose of an emergency fund or a “rainy day fund” is to ensure you can cover expenses in an unexpected financial emergency, such as job loss or large medical bills. The exact definition of an emergency fund is a bit murky, but there are two generally agreed-upon traits:

- Held in cash or highly liquid vehicle such as a checking account, saving account, or money market fund
- Able to cover 6-12 months of expenses

Holding a traditional emergency fund like this is one way to mitigate financial downside, but it is not optimal. To determine what is optimal, we need to assess the ultimate goal of an emergency fund. Breaking it down, the goals are:

1. Have enough cash in hand to cover immediate expenses
2. Be able to withstand a period of up to a year with no income

The first goal should be met through the standard operating cash that you have available, without requiring an emergency fund. For example, I keep two months of expenses in my checking account for rent, food, etc. The second goal can then be accomplished with financial vehicles that can take a few days to get cash in hand. This opens many possible solutions, including cash under a mattress, gold buried in your backyard, money in a saving account, or a sizable investment portfolio.

Since all of these could meet the goals of an emergency fund, how can we choose which is optimal? We need another goal.

**What an Emergency Fund Should Be – Mitigate Risk and Maximize Net Worth**

The two previously mentioned goals of an emergency fund relate to reducing downside risk. But what about the upside? We shouldn’t mitigate risk without thinking about how it can impact our ability to accumulate more wealth. So, let’s add a third goal:

1. Have enough cash in hand to cover immediate expenses
2. Be able to withstand a period of up to a year with no income
3. After the above two goals are met, maximize net worth over time

If your portfolio is large enough to withstand a significant drop and still cover a year’s expenses, these three goals are best met without a traditional emergency fund. The first goal is met by your operating cash, the second by selling investments, and the third by adding as much money to your investment portfolio as possible.

This is intuitive: having more money invested and less in cash will come out ahead over time. But some argue that being forced to sell stocks at a low price after a market downturn will offset the higher average returns from the additional investment. To analyze that counterpoint, let’s look at history.

**History Shows that No Emergency Fund Performs Better**

We’ll analyze two investors over the period from 2000 through 2019, which includes two major market downturns. Both investors started with annual income of $65,000 and expenses of $40,000 that increased with inflation each year. Both kept sufficient operating expenses in a checking account to meet liquid cash need. One investor (EF) saved an additional year of expenses in an emergency fund, with returns that equal inflation. The other (no-EF) invested in a 100% equity portfolio of the Vanguard Total Stock Market Fund (VTSMX or VTI).

The two investors are compared across two scenarios: the worst-case scenario and the best-case scenario. In the worst-case scenario, both investors lost their jobs and had zero income in both 2003 and 2009. The EF investor covered expenses from his emergency fund, and the no-EF investor sold stocks to cover expenses. In the best-case scenario, both investors maintained their jobs throughout the 20-year period. Here is how they fared:

| Year End | No-EF Net Worth (Worst Case) | EF Net Worth (Worst Case) | No-EF Net Worth (Best Case) | EF Net Worth (Best Case) |
|--------|:-------|-------:|:------:|:------:|
| 1999 | $200,000 | $200,000 | $200,000 | $200,000 |
| 2004 | $247,000 | $225,000 | $342,000 | $350,000 |
| 2009 | $312,000 | $257,000 | $510,000 | $523,000 |
| 2014 | $884,000 | $735,000 | $1,292,000 | $1,268,000 |
| 2019 | $1,740,000 | $1,455,000 | $2,430,000 | $2,356,000 |

([full table and graphs here](http://financialvictory.co/you-dont-need-an-emergency-fund/))

In both scenarios, the No-EF investor comes out ahead. Surprisingly, the difference between the two investors is more pronounced in the worst-case scenario when they lose their jobs. In this case **the No-EF investor ends up with a net worth 20% ($285,000) higher.**

While it is true the No-EF investor is forced to sell stocks low, he also buys back in low, shortly after the crash. The EF investor, on the other hand, misses out on this buying opportunity because he spends the next year-and-a-half building back his emergency fund before buying more stock. This causes the EF investor to miss the significant market gains after the crashes.

Unsurprisingly, the No-EF investor also wins in the best-case scenario, though the net worth difference is less pronounced at only 3%.

**Portfolio Size Needed to Forgo an Emergency Fund**

Based on this analysis, it is clear that an investor with a large enough portfolio should forgo an emergency fund. The question, then, becomes: how large of a portfolio is “large enough”?

The portfolio needs to be able to cover a year’s expenses even after a sharp drop. The largest one-year decline of the S&amp;P 500 was 43.3% in 1931. To be extra conservative, let’s assume that a market drop of 75% is possible. To withstand that drop, your available portfolio would need to be 4 times your annual expenses. For example, a portfolio of $200,000 could fall 75% and still cover $50,000 in expenses if sold. If the market drops more than 75%, you likely have bigger societal problems that wouldn’t be solved by any emergency fund.

This amount must be available for you to withdraw without penalty. This includes regular taxable investments and Roth IRA and 401k contributions (after 5 years), but it does not include traditional 401k contributions.

&amp;nbsp;

**Holy wall of text! TLDR?**

If you have built a sizable portfolio, you don’t need a separate stash of cash as your emergency fund. Instead, you can invest all funds according to your asset allocation and sell in case of emergency. This will effectively mitigate your financial downside while also maximizing your net worth over time, allowing you to go fuck yourself faster.

I’m curious as to everyone’s feedback on this idea because it seems to combine the two things typically advised against the most: taking money from your 401k and paying off your mortgage. 

The author proposes using the latest 401k tax adjustments from the CARES Act that waives the 10% early withdrawal fee, but also claims it would be savvy even with the fee.

Do these rules continue to hold strong and this is a doubly bad idea or would unprecedented current events make you reconsider?

I thought this was relevant to FI because housing costs are typically the primary concern for many. If paying off a mortgage earlier rather than later allows you to focus on additional savings and financial independence, is it worth it? Especially if you plan to stay in the same house for the next 10+ years and have another 20 or more left in your career. Personally if our mortgage were $500 a month, we would have a lot of freedom to decide what comes next and not necessarily take the highest paying job.

Under the act, loan limits have doubled from $50k or 50% of vested balance (whichever is lower) to $100,000 or 100% of your account balance (whichever is lower) total without the 10% early-withdrawal penalty. 

I am by no means an expert on how the CARES Act work, but there appears to be two kinds of applicable benefits in terms of your 401k:

1) Withdrawal - under the act, you don’t pay the 10% penalty normal to individuals under 59 1/2. Additionally if you replace the money within 3 years, you are able to recover the federal and state income taxes that apply to the withdrawal according to the American Retirement Association.

2) Loan - To qualify, the loan must be made within 180 days after the act was passed.

Hey all. I put this graphic together (see link). I hope it's illustrative and helpful. It might remind you of some of the great work that u/jerschneid has posted here before. 

I was inspired by multiple redditors, Tweeters, and bloggers recently suggesting, “Market’s down—finally time to buy in!” 

That went against my understanding of the facts. So... 

The **tl;dr:** despite this recent market drawdown and some people's impulse to invest more money at these lower prices, **dollar cost investing is a better long-term strategy than waiting for large market dips**.

**Relevance**

It's relevant to FI because many of our plans rely heavily on the stock market, and recent weeks might shake your confidence in generally accepted steady/lazy strategies. **Stay the course!**

**Explanation of graphic**

The yellow line represents a boring investor who buys $100 worth of S&amp;P index funds every week, from 1990 to today. Simple [dollar cost averaging ](https://intelligent.schwab.com/public/intelligent/insights/blog/dollar-cost-averaging.html)

The red line represents a ""market timer."" He saves his weekly $100 in a money market account, and then buys a lump sum of S&amp;P index funds when the market is drawn down 10% from its previous high water mark. 

I chose 10% as that would be like someone buying into the S&amp;P now, after the coronaviral correction. I’ll come back to this later. 

The blue line looks (after the fact) at the better choice for that week's $100. If DCA was the better choice that week, the blue line ticks up. But if a correction was imminent, then market timing would have been better--and the blue line ticks down.


**Results:**

DCA beats this market timing technique by 38%, or $137K

DCA ended up the better choice for 983 weeks. Timing was better for 583 weeks.

**Notes**
**Dividends?**  I used raw S&amp;P pricing data, meaning that dividends **are not** reinvested. Apologies that it makes the result less relevant to many of you. However (!), dividends would make the conclusion even more definitive.

**10%?** All choices of “dip percentage” still lead to the conclusion that DCA is better. For this time period, waiting for 5% dips was “optimum,” but it still leads a 13% lower portfolio. 

The “market timer’s” money market performance was based on actual money market rates during the period. 

**Analysis:**

Simpler is better. DCA is optimum. However, this is just looking at one 30-year period. Perhaps other periods would show different results. 

While the 10% dip strategy would've proved fruitful here in 2020--buying today would be better than during the past 5 months--this is the exception, not the rule. (see the blue line)

*Also*, this particular 30 year period has an 8-year spell (August '90 to August '98) with no 10% drawdowns, and therefore no buy-ins for the 10% dip strategy. This 8-year spell, and the somewhat similar bull run in the past 8-9 years, are where the DCA strategy ""pulls away"" from the market timer.

There is no “optimum” balance of DCA to timing. If you put 80 bucks into DCA and 20 into the “timing” strategy, then your result would be 80% of DCA plus 20% of timing. And that’s less than 100% of DCA.",financialindependence,Dollar cost averaging vs. 10% drop (e.g. Coronaviral market) timing,0

I’ve been pondering this dilemma for the past few days and since I’ve learned much of what I know from this sub, I would like to ask the collective wisdom here for input.

I will be receiving a substantial annual bonus in about a week’s time + my normal salary. This will equate to about roughly 6.6 months worth of normal take home pay. What would you do with this money given the current market condition?

Now I am not unfamiliar with all the existing research that compares the performance of DCA vs Lump Sum over time and I know the data shows that 66% or more of the time, lump sum beats DCA as the market usually goes up and DCA just means you’re taking risk later so on average you’ll do worse than lump sum over all possible investing periods.

However we all hear that the current market drop is just starting due to the corona virus and most people intuitively feel that the market has more to fall over the next few months AND it could trigger a recession due to multiple points of existing weakness in the current market.

The case here is rather different from looking over all of history to figure whether DCA works better on average. We know that DCA performs much better when the market moves downwards, so in this particular case would DCA over 3-6 months be the most prudent?

In terms of how I’ve decided to go ahead was to follow ERN’s method of DCA given a known lump sum: split the known lump sum amount into 1/3 and invest 1/3 a month before I receive my lump sum (using my emergency fund to make up for this first), 1/3 when I receive the lump sum and 1/3 one month after after receiving the lump sum.

Reasoning: Due to the current pull back, I wanted to accelerate the and get more capital into the market earlier. However I feel that the market could go down more... yet it could also have already all been priced in... and we can’t predict the market so I don’t want to spread the money out too long.

In the end, I think this method helps me sleep better at night.

I'm worried that this is my last chance in the working world due to job hopping so much, don't feel like i'm competent to work in the real world, or am i just being a debby downer at my current job.

I have a unique situation I wanted to throw by you all. I have been pretty successful in my sales career and have had 4 back to back years of fairly significant income. But I have been fortunate enough to realize this will never last and to save/try to avoid lifestyle creep as much as possible.

In the past year, I have paid down 70k in debt, my wife and I are in a good place with a decent 401k and only a house &amp; student loan payment which I am looking to pay off by mid year. We just decided to refinance the house to a 15 year mortgage and start on pay that down more aggressively. 

Problem is, I feel broke... all...the..time. On top of that, I have a growing hate for sales that I never had before.

I’m not broke in the least, but I am so anal about getting this debt cleared while times are good that my family hasn’t even been on vacation. I am really starting to hate my job, because I feel like I am working 24/7 and have nothing to show for it. We both drive 10 year old cars. We live in a modest house for our income and we don’t really spend on a lot of non-necessities. In fact, I have structured my entire monthly bill cycle on my base alone.

So the question is, is my drive for FIRE potentially sabotaging my success in sales because I am underspending?",financialindependence,Is the path to Fire making me miserable?,0

As a beginner, it can be even more intimidating. I kept seeing everyone around me seemingly making moves with their investments but I had no idea to approach it. Then I decided to start reading more for myself. These three books were everything I needed as beginner:

\- Stock Investing for Dummies: Helped me understand how much I could afford to invest and what the key terms and definitions were. The best thing about this book is that you can jump around from chapter to chapter since each specific topic is fairly self-contained with that chapter. Also, the appendix can point you in the right direction with resources to learn more different brokers and investing books and websites to learn more.

\- Unshakeable by Tony Robbins: An excellent guide on the mindset that you need to have as an investor. It provides several facts that can free you from the fear and anxiety that dominates most people’s financial lives. I really think that this was the book that gave me the confidence I needed to get started with investing because of the amount of factual information about the market that was given.

\- The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham: There are 2 chapters in here that will teach you more about being a successful investor than anything else. One on market fluctuations and one on incorporating what he calls a “Margin of safety”, which could help prevent you from losing a lot of money on your investments. Part of the focus of this book is to show you the importance in doing your own research before making any investments.

I highly recommend these and break these down in detail here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4wmcHElQY&amp;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aE4wmcHElQY&amp;)

We just got married 6 months ago, and we're unfortunately just now learning all the tax implications of MFS.

We had no idea that you can't contribute to a Roth when filing separately, so we're $5,500 in excess for last year. That leaves two questions:

1. What's the most advantageous way to fix the Roth excess so we don't pay the 6% penalty? I'm thinking we can withdraw it to pay down some of our house, as that amount would bring us to the removal of PMI.
2. What retirement option is the best for us filing separately if we want to continue to put money toward FIRE? I've heard about backdoor Roths, but I don't understand how they work. We already have a 401k with his employer, but we risk maxing it and having money left over to invest. Traditional Roth? VTSAX?

Longtime listener, first-time caller. Looked through the top content and sidebar, but didn't see this specific issue addressed so thought I'd toss it out there. If the question has already been reviewed and I missed it, please link me.

Me: 160k gross annual, LCOL, 30 yo, started making real progress on personal finance about a year ago, current NW=168k with ~75k being 401k, ~20k in an investment account, 13k HSA, 60k cash (this is combined emergency fund, travel funds and 20% dwnpmt for a house this year). No debt as of May last year (yay!). Monthly expenses are 1500/month (bachelor, work-from-home, low rent). 

Lifestyle may change as I'm getting more interested in the marriage/kids front, but on any financial scenario that I try and calculate a FIRE number for, I wrestle with how to address the fact that my full NW isn't exactly ""available"" at my target FIRE date(s). Since I won't withdraw from 401k until I'm 59 1/2, I feel like I need to adjust my math in some meaningful way to prepare for both the time between FIRE and 59.5 and then thereafter. Basically, two completely separate FIRE numbers for different phases of life.

The best I've come up with and read about seems to be that my FIRE date should be such that the non-401k investments/cash should be calculated so that a 2-4% SWR would cover expenses between initial age of FIRE until 59.5. Then, make sure my 401k/retirement balances would cover 59.5 until ~100 years old (god willing)  at a similar SWR.

Also makes me wonder if I also need to pay more attention to the balance between the two. (At what point am I inflating one side of the equation at the expense of the other?)

So FIRE community, am I overthinking this? Am I onto something but maybe thinking about it wrong? Any feedback welcome!",financialindependence,How do you address not being able to withdraw from 401k until 59.5 in your SWR calculations?,0

I've been posting my family's net worth updates annually for many years (see [2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/308xtv/on_track_to_re_by_50/), [2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/4a6oww/one_year_update/), [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/5ynkqi/two_year_update/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/838e92/three_year_update/), and [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/b44qvp/four_year_update/) updates); I find sharing my plans and progress to be helpful for giving myself a heading check, and hope this community finds my inputs to be helpful.

**Current ages: 34 and 33**. We have two kids and are now (finally!) seeing a slow wind-down in childcare costs as they start to reach school age.  It's still a hefty bill, but we've always managed to keep it reasonable through dependent care FSAs and credit card churning.  

**Combined pre-tax income**: About $196k (\~5.9% increase). In my very first post back in 2015, I mentioned that we had a goal of reaching $200k income by 2020.  And here we are!  My wife gets her raises later in the year, which will officially push us over the top.  For reference, we don't live in a major metro, and things are in the low to medium cost of living range.  So this is big money for us.

**Assets:**

Cash/emergency fund: \~$44k (10% increase). We're doing some work on the house, so building up cash reserves.  More in a bit on that.

Tax advantaged Retirement/HSA accounts: \~$484k (12% increase). This was looking awesome until the recent COVID-19 panic a couple weeks ago.  Then it went down $50k.  Oh well.  We're now maxing out my TSP, my wife's 401k, both Roth IRAs, and about $4,100 towards an HSA.  Almost out of tax shelters.

529 accounts: \~$36k (12% increase). We're contributing about $3k/year for each of our children - our plan is to cover \~75% of the total cost of a public university in our state, including housing and food. A change here is that we converted a portion of these over to our state's prepaid tuition plan.  Our state has a good one at a reasonable cost that will give you full value if they end up going out-of-state; I recommend you read your state plan's details very carefully before you do this though, because most prepaid tuition plans suck.

Taxable investments: \~$9k (25% decrease). In a bit of good news, we coincidentally sold some of our index funds here about a month ago, not in an attempt to time the market, but just to pay for some home repairs/upgrades.  As we run out of tax shelters, most future raises are going to go here, so this account should start seeing big growth later this year.

Vehicles: $31.6k KBB value of three cars (13% decrease). Same cars as last year, just depreciation.  The Chevy Volt's amazing, by the way.  We just put gas in it yesterday for the first time this year.  It's March.

Home: Using Federal Reserve MSA home index, our home value is now \~$577k (10.5% increase), using Zillow estimate is currently $653k (11.6% increase).  This feels high to me, but our local market has seen great gains over the last year.  Our house is over 20 years old and has some basic things that need fixing - old furnace, old water heaters, double paned windows that are failing, etc.  Additionally, we're going to replace the roof and install solar.  To pay for these repairs/upgrades, we're using a combination of cash and are in the middle of a cash out refinance, because holy shit have y'all seen interest rates lately?

**Debts:**

Mortgage: $272k at 3.125% (3% decrease). I never thought I would see lower interest rates than what we got in 2012.  But we just locked in a 2.875% 30 year rate through our credit union which should close in the next month or so.  This is so absurdly low for long-term debt that we would never even consider paying it off early.

Home Equity Loan: $44k at 4.75% (7% decrease). This will be rolled into our refinanced mortgage, so should disappear soon, and will significantly increase our cash flow.

Car Loan: $20k at 3.1% (17% decrease). For the Chevy Volt.

**Net Worth Estimate:** $846k using MSA Home Index (\~17% increase), $922k using Zillow (\~18% increase).  We were *really damn close* to hitting seven figures a couple weeks ago, which I'm a little salty about.  But maybe we'll still hit it by later this year.

**Current plans going forward:** Between our retirement accounts (including matches), 529s, and HSA, we're up to like $70k a year towards tax advantaged savings.  Soon we'll be able to max out the HSA, then we can start working on building a tier of taxable investments.  Our goal is to be able to FIRE if we want to by \~2030 with \~$100k income.  Feels like we're [pretty on track](https://imgur.com/szNZgiU).

However what makes people think these returns should continue at all. I would argue historic returns are based on the rapid increase in a number of large companies - made only possible by a burgeoning economic power, rapid popular growth, and increased market consolidation among the largest companies. I don’t see any reason why those factors will lead to similar growth over the coming 50 years.

If the S&amp;P 500 wasn’t in such a unique scenario you’d be able to get similar longterm returns with other developed market ETFs (Japan, Europe etc) but clearly that’s not the case and the US seems to be an outlier.

I am somewhat new to the pursuit of better finances, and am hoping someone can help me regarding a question I have regarding the tax deduction for the Traditional IRA.

Last month, I decided to open a Traditional IRA account and began making contributions for the 2019 tax year. As it turns out, after filing my taxes I learned that my modified adjusted gross income is around 75,000 dollars, which appears to put me above the level at which I am able to deduct contributions from my taxes. However, different articles online seem to say different things based on how my employer sponsored retirement works.

I do have an employer 401k which I contributed approximately 3000 dollars to. Given this situation, am I allowed to deduct an additional 3000 from my IRA contribution, or is my best bet to roll it all into a Roth IRA without taking a deduction?

242,aristotelian74,1583521231,self.financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/fei9ub/does_swr_apply_with_record_low_interest_rates/,81,False,1,"The 10 Year Treasury which is the basis for SWR research is currently sitting at a record low of 0.74%. Not just below average, but all time record low. I am curious to hear some discussion of what this might mean for SWR research and FIRE strategies.

With bond yields at record lows, FIRE investors are faced with a choice between locking up a large portion of their portfolio in risk free assets with an expected *nominal* return of under 1%, or take their chances with a more aggressive stock allocation. (You might look at 10-15 year performance of bond funds and note that they have returned more than their yield, but that is only due to the long term trend of lower interest rates, culminating in what we are seeing today). 

The Good

Record low interest rates is an indication of low underlying inflation. Institutions are only willing to loan money so cheap if they have confidence that the principal will have the same value with the interest paid back. Arguably, this new world of low yields is only possible with the removal of one of the principal threats to retirement success. This also means things like cheaper mortgages and other debt.

The Bad 

However, this means there is no historical precedent for such low income (actually negative real return) coming from the bond side of the portfolio. Perhaps more importantly, the larger macroeconomic context is unprecedented, so we just don't know what effects this trend could have. For example, the Fed may have less room to stimulate the economy in the event of a recession. A market crash when interest rates are already effectively zero could potentially be larger in scale and longer in duration than previous events we have seen (on the other hand, it is possible that the Fed is getting ahead of the potential recession, propping up the economy to pre-empt a major crash. This seems to be what the Fed is thinking with its emergency rate cut this week). 

While SWR research is based on 100's of years of backtesting data, the current situation is unprecedented. I submit that we simply cannot say for sure that the SWR research will hold up. 

Possible Strategies

1. Shift to higher yielding corporate bonds. However, corporate bonds are riskier and more correlated with the market than Treasuries, therefore expected to produce lower risk-adjusted returns. Muni bonds may have the same issue. 
2. Increase your stock allocation. However, you will be more vulnerable to sequence of returns risk, especially in the scenario above where the Fed has no ability to correct a major market event. 
3. Shift to TIPS. At least TIPS will be guaranteed to match inflation (although I have seen some reports of TIPS starting to sell with negative real rates). However, TIPS are somewhat less un-correlated with the market than traditional Treasuries and don't do as well in backtesting. 
4. Explore annuities. Annuities can provide guaranteed income. However, they are subject to inflation risk, can be costly, and you lose the ability to pass the principal on to your heirs. 

Basically, I don't see a good option that does not involve saving more. I am curious to hear thoughts on how FIRE folks are strategizing and coping with this inherent uncertainty.",financialindependence,Does SWR Apply with Record Low Interest Rates?,0

TL:DR - FIRE'd 2 years ago. Net worth ~4.X M (stock market makes it fluctuate a lot lately...) with ~2.3M in a personal non-retirement stock account (mostly index funds). I also own a house worth around 1M (150k mortgage remains). I moved to a new city 4 months ago.

I am currently renting out my house to some friends in the old city. I am currently renting in the new city, but HATE the lack of control. I'm going to be here for a while so I want to buy a house if I can. For certain reasons I can't sell my other house for a few years. I've been retired for 2 years now and make about 50k in dividends and take in 24k in rent. Mortgage loans are based on **how much you get in monthly income** and assets are basically ignored (side note: yes, you can get a shitty asset depletion loan at a shitty APR but fuck that). So I currently qualify for a loan of ~300k which is not enough to outright buy in this area.

For family reasons I will not be leaving here (aka I will buy a house here - going somewhere else is currently not an option). I'm considering drawing down my bond fund as the primary source of paying for the house, and then using the up-to-300k loan the bank will offer to cover the remainder. I'd love to hear intelligent reactions to how good or terrible this idea is.

I posted this article because I feel like it parallels one of the main benefits of FI – More freedom to pursue jobs and activities that you deem as higher value.

 

To briefly summarize, there was a pilot project in Ontario that saw roughly 4000 people receive universal basic incomes (UBI) over the course of 13-17 months.  It would have been a 3-year study, but the provincial government decided to scrap the program half-way through.  So take the results with a grain of salt.  That said, the items that stuck out as most interesting were that:

 

1. Three quarters of people continued to work while receiving UBI.  

What does this tell us?  It could mean that these people derived value other than money from their jobs.  However, I'd say it's difficult to definitively conclude that since participants were aware that this was a short-term study and that after 3 years, the UBI would stop.  Work would be necessary for them once the UBI stopped, and if they quit their jobs now, they'd be three years ""behind"" in their savings/careers.  The amount of UBI paid (generally $17k CAD /year per person, $24k CAD /year for couples) may have also been a factor as to why most participants continued to work.
 
 
2. Of the three quarters of people who continued to work, more than one third were able to move to higher paying and more secure jobs.  

This to me is the most telling.  It seems like these people were able to take more risks in their jobs to move to better positions, or were able to leave precarious/toxic jobs and move onto something better.  Anecdotal accounts of that are within the article.  I think this is the point that mirrors FI the most.  Without having to worry about your next paycheque as much, you have more freedom to explore your ""highest and best use"", or at least find better employment.  You're no longer beholden to a bad job.  I've seen members on this subreddit express the same sentiments – freedom to find better employment since money is no longer an incumbrance.

So, I'm a bit confused. Very confused actually. 

For those of you who save (yearly) MORE than the $19500 limit on your 401k and MORE than the (Yearly) 5500 IRA account - Are you losing money by not having all of your investments in one place (like one index fund) instead of putting your money into 3 separate investment accounts? 

Because how I understand it, the more that an investment fund has in it, the faster it will grow (all things equal, assuming the stock market is growing yearly).

But maybe the employer contribution would make up for this? But after a certain point, wouldn't you still be behind by having 3 different retirement accounts instead of placing them all in the same index fund (or whatever individual investment account you have)? 

Or does all of this depend on how long you want to keep this money in your retirement accounts (like say invest for 10 years before withdrawing to retire versus investing for 35 years before withdrawing to retire)? 

i hope I'm not confusing anybody and that I make sense.

Keeping taxes in mind that we wouldn't want to withdraw all the funds immediately we would calculate where our tax brackets would increase and try to avoid pulling all out (I make ~100K/yr my brother about 40K). We withdraw regularly and put in regular contributions.

Scenario 2
We withdraw everything trying to share the burden of tax increases and immediately plop the lump sum in our desired allocations.

I’m about to get my yearly bonus this Friday which will amount to around 9500 dollars. I imagine I’ll see somewhere around 6500 of it after taxes. 
Ive already deposited 2000 into my Roth and wanted to use some of it to fund the remainder for the year. That’s how I normally spend my Roth every year, but due to some poor financial decisions and unexpected decisions, my emergency of around 8k is now down to about 3k. My thought is even if I fund my Roth fully, I’ll still have some leftover to bring the e-fund back up a bit to about 6k. Then, I could divert what I was contributing to the Roth (about 100 a month) into the e fund and build it back up since the Roth will be full for the year. But the markets and the coronavirus stuff is making me think I should save the whole thing for a worst case scenario and just try to contribute regularly to the roth and not prioritize maxing it out. 

For reference and a little background, I work as a chemical engineer in Mass for a biotech company and make around 95k, so I feel like my job is pretty secure, but I obviously don’t want to count on always having it especially if a recession actually occurs. I have about 205k net worth basically all invested in index funds, besides the e fund I mentioned which is in cash. I also own a rental property that I owner occupy and it gets me 1000 a month in rent. I spend between 3k-4.5k a month including the mortgage but it really varies significantly depending on what big expenses pop up. If I were to lose my job, I could certainly keep my expenses down. I also live with my fiancé which hedges some risk in case one of us loses our job.

&amp;#x200B;

**Default: aggregate bond funds**

Pros: Easy to buy in any brokerage account. Market value increases when interest rate drops, often cushioning a fall in equity, allowing you to rebalance into equity in a market correction. 

Cons: Current rate is low. Market value can drop if interest rate drops, or if credit rating of the issuer drops or defaults. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Certificate of Deposits (CDs)**

Pros: You can lock in \~2% right now. See [http://depositaccounts.com](http://depositaccounts.com/) for latest rates from different banks. FDIC or other insurance protects your principle.

Cons: You have to open an account at different banks to chase rates, which is nearly impossible in 401k/IRAs (see brokered CDs, which can be bought in brokerage accounts, but ). Most have early withdrawal penalties. 

&amp;#x200B;

**I Bonds**

Pros: Current rate is 0.2% + inflation if you buy before May, this is much higher than current TIPS yield. Protects against unexpected inflation, similar to TIPS, but principle cannot go down. Is a US Treasury, thus exempt from state tax. Interest is tax free if used for education. 

Cons: Locked for 1 year, early withdrawal penalty if withdrawn within 5 years. Must open a TreasuryDirect account. Limited to $10k + $5k via tax refund each year, not scalable. 

&amp;#x200B;

**EE Bonds**

Pros: Rate works out to be at least 3.5% if held for 20 years. Similar to I Bonds, exempt from state tax and tax free if used for education. 

Cons: Interest rate is near 0 if withdrawing before 20 years. Yearly contribution limits same as I Bonds.",financialindependence,Alternatives to bonds [US],0

Hectic environment was the norm. 250+ hours/month for 4 months, no weekends, no exercises. I was like: “I’m young, I can do all of it”.


## Problem
Then, all of the sudden, I felt an irregular heart rate. I felt my heart beating faster for 2 days. This situation led me to a hospital visit. Burnt out detected. I was told to reduce workload. At least, my heart and everything else was completely fine.

***This problem would change my mindset forever.***


## Solution
Worrying about my life, I left the company and planned to spend 1 year taking care of myself, no work at all. (At the time I was living at home, no kids, 2 years of savings, which facilitated my decision)

## My new mindset
- I will never work as many hours as before
- I will not worry about work as much as I will about my health


## What did I do next?
2 months into my “forced sabbatical”. Got a call from a former colleague: a job proposal. “NO, I’ll stay 1 year off work”. “How about doing a contract, working from home, at your own time?” I sent my proposal, considering 8hrs/day, higher rates and extended delivery dates. “Ok, agreed”.

Fast forwarding some years, I co-created a B2B product (similar to QlikView and GeckoBoard) at my own pace (10 months), without pressures (working normal hours). Took us 10 months to strike the first sale!


## Company of One
I ran the company for 9 years:

- 3 co-founders, I was the only one - working full time
- 4 clients only
- 4 employees
- All projects had realistic deadlines. We wouldn't allow pressure from clients to deliver earlier
- No extra hours
- Flexible time, we mostly could work whenever and wherever we wanted to, following the deliverables

All of it also allowed me to work less hours and enjoy the chased freedom. **We were thriving.**


## Finally, the dreamed life
Everything was running accordingly. No long hours. Holidays abroad. Time to exercise. Low 7 figures revenue. Great profit. Highly efficient employees. The dreamed life had arrived! To make it even better, I received an offer and sold my company for something in the north of 7 times my yearly earnings.


## Moving abroad
With money on hand was time for us (my wife and I) to take the biggest decision of our lives: to move abroad, from the hot and sunny Brazil to London (I’ll write another post with the reasons we decided to move).


## I’m on top of the world
Now, I have all the time I wished for. I can travel a lot. I don’t need to work. I’m successful, anything I launch will be profitable. I know how to make money. 

Then I travelled. I didn’t look for a new job at all. I invested my time in side-projects as diverse as a list of transport options from airports to city centres. List of UK beers. List of videogame’s musics.


## Is everything going according to the plan?
Well, my new lifestyle was not bringing me real happiness. **Having anything I dreamed of without any clear purpose was meaningless.**

Adding to this, my side-projects were not helping anyone. **This made me realise I wasn't as invincible as I arrogantly had thought.**


## The meaning of my life
One of the purposes of our moving abroad, was to raise kids in a safer country, with less problematic politics. Then, sticking to the original plan, it was time to have a baby. He was born 2 years after I started my dreamed, empty life.

Since then, I'm one of the most important people in the world, at least for him. My life now has the most clear objectives, most difficult challenges and the best rewards ever: 
- **to make him as happy as possible. If he’s happy, I’m more than happy** 

- **to raise him without any preconceived views**

- **and many, many more**

**Now, I’m on top of the world.**

## My today’s world
Since 2018 I'm working as a Project Manager/Product Owner after 12 years as an employer. 

Why? My mind needs to be active (empty mind sucks). It makes me feel alive. I need the income. 

There are loads of positive points now, like 25 days of holidays, clear direction, having a boss to learn from, working in an industry I’m passionate about (sports), career progression, etc.

## My future
I’m chasing the dream, once again, of launching something that helps people. Why? 
- to see the real joy of helping people solve their problems
- to spend quality time with my family. This time will never come back
- to have the freedom to work whenever and wherever I’m the most productive
- To feel the rush when a new client buys my product

Now, I’m 100% sure I’m using my time and money way more wisely than before.",financialindependence,Achieved my dreamed FIRE life...but it was meaningless,0

First time posting, new to reddit &amp; the community. Trying to achieve FI like all you good folks. Here’s my situation:

Age: 26 and a half

Net worth: $417,000

401k balance: $93,000 (maxed out each year with employer match, roughly $25k yearly contribution)

Self managed brokerage account comprised of VOO (55%), Amazon (23%), Google (9%) Home Depot (5%), DraftKings (5%), (learning as I go and trying to figure out the best strategy): $137,000

Personal Capital portfolio (.9% annual fee all in): $158,000

Savings/cash: $37,000 (with a solid tax return &amp; bonus  coming in a couple weeks totaling $20k-$25k)

Additionally, my partner currently has a net worth of $140,000 with $35,000 in a Roth IRA (which is maxed out every year) and $24,000 in a 401k (with a $13,000 total contribution every year). They also have a self managed brokerage account valued at $15,000. I think the rest is in savings. My partner will probably stop working in 7-9 years.

After all expenses (which includes retirement contributions) we net about $100,000 in savings each year that ends up mostly in our brokerage accounts (and sometimes lingers in our savings accounts). When my partner stops working, we will net roughly $50,000 in savings each year. By that time, kids (3?) will be in the picture.

We will probably start paying a mortgage in 5 years. We have no debt. I would like to retire by 45 give or take a few years.

Fast forward close to 20 years and after lurking this sub  I decided to check up on it. 

It has done pretty well to the point that its projected to pay me an unexpected $1700 / month at age 65 or approx 800/month if I retire early at 55. 

Combined with the pension I have now which is projected to pay me $2500/month at 65 at my current employer and my retirement savings as well as investment property (currently valued at $800k) I don't know how I should proceed in rejigging my retirement planning. 

Providing everything moves at an approx 4% rate of return over the next 15 years is it out of line to consider selling the investment property at 55 along with my retirement savings and letting that ride me to 65 where my pensions kick in?  I don't plan on living a lavish lifestyle and I currently do not have any debts. 

Is there an opportunity here to retire earlier then 55?

It's living below your means. All too often, our lifestyle tends to expand whenever we get a salary increase. If we're not careful, it expands beyond our means as we treat ourselves to fancy clothes, jewels, new cars, and vacations in sunny destinations. Often we feel obliged to put on a display of false prosperity to gratify our ego or to earn esteem in the eyes of others. But this primrose path leads to overdue credit card statements, missed payments, wrecked credit scores, sleepless nights, and eventually bankruptcy.

But if you put yourself in the right mindset, you can avoid this trap and start building your future upon a rock. 

Don't think too much about what other people are thinking or saying. Here are 7 ways to start living below your means.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Understand your means ; what is your take home pay? After taxes and other contributions?

 This is an important starting part. How much is it that you have to spend from month-to-month. 

&amp;#x200B;

2. Downsize your home if possible.

Ask yourself:

Are you using all the space in your house? Do you have a guest room that no one uses? or only rarely? If so, consider moving into a smaller residence. 

&amp;#x200B;

3. Save from the start (Pay yourself first)

Put money aside for savings first. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. Reduce your non-essentials.

Do you need to buy coffee at the cafe?

Do you need to buy clothes every month? Does that really need to be part of your budget?

&amp;#x200B;

5. Keep track of your spending 

Put all your receipts in an envelope. Put everything in a spreadsheet. Keep track of services you've cancelled to make sure they aren't charging you. 

&amp;#x200B;

6. Create a budget (Do you have a budget?) 

Your money needs a map. Create zero based budget. i.e., Nothing should be left over after expenses and savings. 

&amp;#x200B;

7. Use credit card wisely.

Make sure you pay off balance regularly. Don't pay interest. Build credit rating. Get points and cashback.

&amp;#x200B;

Once again, stop worrying about what others are saying about you and focus on building your long-term prosperity.

me: 37, 150k in ROTH/IRAs, 10k in cash. Good steady job, moderate expenses (2-3k a mo), target retirement in about 15 years. 

typical plan: continue to max out IRAs, build to 25k in cash savings, then start plowing excess into VSTAX(or whatever similar vehicle).

Considering modification: while expenses are currently lower (1.7k-2.5k) start buying into vehicle now, while doing less in savings. right now I get about 2k a month that I'm putting into savings, but I'm considering 1k a month in savings and 1k in VSTAX.  


wildcard: career is cyclical in nature, so I fairly regularly am without inflow. current job is permanent, but not funded beyond June 2021 (working on that), so that savings will be tapped then to fill the gaps, but I feel like if I put it in a money market I could basically tap that if I had to and pay cap gains.

I have been seeing 3-4 posts/wk here and some misguided stocktwits about the ranging nature of PCG, and because of the news coming, I wanted to relay why I became long on PCG (shares) yesterday and why I plan to add more.

-The stock offering is nothing new, it was part of the bk exit plan, and the consensus is that the offering will be better than expected to appease the victims' trust and all interested parties involved

-We've been seeing a lot more interest from institutions and funds the past couple weeks and with July 1st as the tentative exit date from BK, these excluded investors who couldn't buy while in bankruptcy will come in. My company has also interest in adding PCG because it holds up well in a down market at these prices.

-Big named funds like Appaloosa and Baupost committed to adding more shares. Since this is one of the biggest bk exits in the U.S., there is a long list of underwriters such as Goldman, Morgan, and others that will accumulate shares. Institutions and funds love when big name players get into a ticker.

-The current issue will set a floor, this will likely get pumped up to get a higher close before 7/1. $10 is a strong support w/ a confluence of price &amp; trend lines. Shares should stabilize here and possibly climb closer to $12 by 7/1 because the victims' trust value can not fall further under the 6.75 billion amount. There will be backlash if that were the case; PCG, institutions, and all interested parties will only benefit by buoying up the stock price.

-Indicators show extreme oversold, while at the same time accumulation for buyers. Short sellers have taken advantage of the uncertainty before bankruptcy exit to shake out weak hands. However with a near dated certainty now, the profit potential for shorts has waned because there can be price spikes any moment.

-Likely see some form of a short squeeze

-Our valuation of a forward P/E ratio of 2.52, also EPS growth is accelerating, so growth in the next 2 years will be better than the last few. Fundamentals indicate a cheap valuation to hold for the long term w/ a coming short term spike",financialindependence,Digesting PCG News,0

I am 30 years old and am looking into opening up a Roth IRA. Recently, I opened up a TD Ameritrade out of convenience because my minor account was through them (love it so far). From what I've read, it seems the most agreed upon Roth IRA portfolio strategy for someone my age would be (give or take): ~70% ETFs (ex: VOO, VT) and ~30% Bonds (ex: BDN), and maybe a small handful of individual blue chip dividend stocks.

I have two questions:

1) **Which Brokerage?** Vanguard ETFs seem to be incredibly popular. Would I be paying less in fees if I were to choose Vanguard as a brokerage to build my Roth IRA portfolio? If I stick with TD Ameritrade, would I be at a disadvantage in seeking these specific ETFs or bonds? Which brokerage should I seek for *specifically* a Roth IRA? I am fairly certain my best/most popular options are (1) Vanguard, (2) TD Ameritrade, (3) M1 Finance, and (4) Fidelity. Convince away!

2) **2019 Contributions** Having recently learned that one can still contribute to their 2019 Roth IRA account due to the extentsion, does this mean that I can as well (even if I open up a Roth IRA in 2020)? I am looking to make a decision and take the plunge before the July 15th deadline if so!

Here’s where my confusion about Coast Fire lies...

So, say you reach your Coast Fire goal at age 35. Now you have saved up enough money, so that you can comfortably retire at age 65, so you don’t need to worry about or touch your retirement funds anymore until then. I get why this is largely beneficial and a huge accomplishment. I get this part of it completely!

But what I don’t get, is the articles and people explaining that once you hit your Coast Fire goal, you are “financially independent”. You are free to live the life you want, live where you want, quit your job and work at a lower paying job that makes you much happier. 

But... how is this possible? All of your retirement money is saved to be used when you’re 65. So what about those 30 years in between? You’re NOT financially independent, because you can’t touch that money for another 30 years. You still need to find a way to make a living in the meantime, because you need that money to survive. How is this the equivalent of being financially independent? You are still technically a slave to working at a job that provides for you and your family until you retire... right?

Am I not understanding Coast Fire correctly? If I am missing something about this particular fire method, I hope that someone can explain it to me better!

He argues that the difference between the 2008 crisis and the current crisis is that in 2008 the banks did not have much excess reserves, and the Fed's balance sheet expansion increased those reserves without much new lending. The current bailouts are cash infusions directly to businesses and consumers, and he cites the rapid increase in M1 and M2 money supply that did not occur anywhere near as much as it is happening now. There is something like a 30% increase in Americans' checking accounts due to the crisis. Just look at the current M2 money supply: 

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2

Siegel predicts a sharp increase in spending next year and higher inflation, contrary what many other analysts are saying (long term low or negative yields). Thus, Siegel predicts a bond bear market and that the low interest environment of the current period will end. Ultimately, Siegel argues that the coronavirus bailouts will be paid ultimately by bond holders, as currently issued low yield bonds will face capital losses. He does not advocate dumping bonds altogether, but shifting from 60/40 more towards the 20-25% bonds. 

He also predicts long-term stock returns to also decline from historically 7% to 5.5%.

But upon crunching the numbers I realized that leaving now and taking a job that pays just enough to cover my bills (CoastFIRE) would only extend my working career by around 3.5 years! Such is the miracle of compound growth.

YMMV but if you get the opportunity to receive a generous severance package, and you're already within striking distance of FIRE, it may be worth looking into - especially if you are sick of your job or want a career change anyway.

Personally, I have found a great sense of purpose from the volunteering that I've done over the years (animal shelter, youth mentoring) and my hope is that by taking a job at an NPO, even one that pays 25% of what I make now, I'd be able to go to work every morning knowing I'm making a positive difference in someone's life. I know the grass isn't always greener but I'm hoping that a smaller NPO wouldn't have the bureaucracy, layers of management, meetings, never-ending corporate initiatives, forms and checklists, corporate jargon, etc. that I deal with now.

An additional 3.5 years of working would be worth it for me... I think. I was probably going to do this after hitting FIRE anyway!

Shoot holes in this plan please. My current job is low stress and has regular hours, decent co-workers, and a great boss. It pays way more than I could ever ask for. So if I need to shut up, thank my lucky stars, and suck it up for a few more years please comment. 

Or if you think that I've paid my dues, only get to live once, and am closer than I think to being able to go fuck myself, please let me know as well!

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR CoastFIRE may be worth looking into if you have an option to take severance; it may extend your working career by less than you think!**

Additional relevant information: 

* I'll show my work in a comment below. The 3 years of working difference holds true for anything greater than 4%.
* The layoff selection won't happen until Q4, so hopefully by the final date of employment, the economy will be in a better place for hiring.
* Savings: by Q4 will be approx $1 million in 401k, Roth 401k, Roth IRA (backdoor and mega backdoor), HSA, lump sum pension, severance, taxable accounts, and savings.
* FIRE goal of $1.5 million. Average yearly spend (not accounting for health insurance) of less than $30k",financialindependence,"If you can volunteer to get laid off to receive severance, a CoastFIRE job may only extend your career by a few years more",0

Related to that, I'd like to share how I think about my FIRE goal.

For a metaphor, I recently had to do a 24 hour drive. That's a long drive. I could break it up into 2 days, 3 day, or hell, I could muscle through it and drive for 24 hours straight. Most people wouldn't recommend the last option, but it does allow you to reach your goal the fastest. So what I did for my drive is establish ""checkpoints"". As I reached major cities, I did a sanity check to see if I'm alert enough to continue driving.

I'm trying to take the same approach with my FIRE goal. While the end goal to my drive was reaching the destination, the goal with FIRE is to be financially independent. The journey to FI can look very different - it appears that everyone is trying to plan ahead exactly what that journey looks like. My proposal is to play it by ear. I have NW ""checkpoints"" where my goal is to re-evaluate my path at each turn.

\-When I reach $500k NW, I could consider a less stressful job where I don't continue to save as much, but elect to have a longer career. Maybe barista FIRE is right for me at this point. Or I can keep pushing along at full speed.

\-If I continue along at full speed, I'll keep going the course until I reach $1MM. At this point, could I lean/barista FIRE? Could I reduce my workload? Maybe start investing more heavily in real estate and become a full time landlord? Or have things gotten better in my current environment to where I'm okay with continuing on my drive?

&amp;#x200B;

This doesn't change anything fundamentally outside of your mindset. Doing this way allows you to stop fixating on how many years of grinding your job remains, because there is no set number of years anymore. That fixation can be unhealthy and make you hate your job even more.  Just keep driving down the highway - when you're capable of taking a pit stop, you can decide then if you need to take a piss or nap.

If you asked me what my FIRE number is, the honest answer is ""I don't know."" But that doesn't mean I'm not properly forecasting or preparing for my future. I just find it less stressful to not get fixated on a specific end goal. We're in the middle of a long journey, stop kicking my seat and asking me ""are we there yet?""

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I highly recommend reading through the comments. Some people bring up great points to add to this discussion. Some people asked great questions to which I expanded my thoughts on a little. The most important thing that came up is that your checkpoints don't need to be based on net worth. They should be milestones that are meaningful to your financial future - new promotion, burnt out from work, family member gets ill, have a child, etc. The important aspect is that you don't treat FIRE as a straight line, obsession doesn't get you there any faster. Everyone's path is going to evolve overtime, make sure you're in the right position to adapt to those evolutions. ",financialindependence,A different way to think about your FIRE number,0

If these return-to-work programs become more prevalent in the future, would having a higher withdrawal rate be acceptable?

I've been lurking here for years now, but it's time to add my story and some advice. Hopefully it will help someone out. My FIRE strategy is primarily focused on saving money by letting my employer pay for my living expenses. 

I am a 35-year-old nomad, current net worth around $200k, but it's been increasing at around $50k per year in the past 2 years, with the same forecasted increase as long as I keep this job and lifestyle. 

I had fallen in love with NYC on a college spring break trip, so I moved to Manhattan after college and lived there for 12 years, which gave me a slow start to FIRE in a HCOL location. But I did manage to save money overall, despite never having a salary of more than $60k/year. I saved quite a bit by living for 7 years in an 85-square-foot microapartment.

I now take overseas assignments as a government contractor and get housing + per diem payments (as listed on state.gov) on top of my regular pay. Since I don't have a permanent home now, I can easily afford to live off the per diem and save my entire salary. I usually work a total of 9-10 months per year. When I'm back in the US, I spend most of my time city-hopping, visiting long-time friends who are generally happy to host me for a few nights.

A security clearance was a requirement for my job, which took me 8 months, so the process wasn't simple, but the good news is that there are more vacancies than qualified workers, so I can be fairly confident about taking time off and getting another assignment when I'm ready to work again.

If that doesn't work out, I'm confident about having enough for CoastFIRE right now. I've told friends that this could be the last full-time job that I ever have. After this, I'd just work part time and spend the rest of my time on my hobbies. I'm a minimalist who is fine with living in developing countries, which helps to cut down on expenses. 

Otherwise, I like learning languages as a hobby, for those of you who know the CEFR standards, right now I'm at B2 Spanish, B2 German, A2 French, and A2 Russian. I have CELTA certification to teach English, so could see myself living in developing speaking countries, teaching English part time and learning languages part time.

So advice that could benefit someone:

There's plenty of US government contractor work that's well-paid when you consider the perks, and much less stressful than working at a corporate job where the company is trying to milk the most out of you. To me, the slower pace of work was alone worth the switch to this line of work. 

For many Americans, there's a myth out there that the US provides the best health care in the world. For very specialized cases, that might be true...maybe the best doctors for a rare disease are located in the US. But otherwise, I've become a huge fan of medical tourism...the same quality at huge discounts. In developing countries, I stick with JCI-accredited hospitals.

As someone with plenty of free time on my hands, I've often wondered whether I'll get bored after FIRE. This message board has shown me that I'm not alone in this struggle. But I think language learning is going to be one of the a long-term answers for me...it's more affordable than ever now, thanks to online tutoring. There are also websites that let you do language exchanges, if you don't want to pay. And if you can move abroad, it could be a ticket to more affordable COL destinations.",financialindependence,Nomad FIRE,0

My #1 goal in life is to have the freedom of how to spend my time every day. I am currently 25 years old living in the U.S. and my plan is to FIRE before 30, ideally as soon as possible. Due to how badly I want my time I am willing to FIRE extremely bare bones: food, shelter, power, internet. (No car, no kids, etc.)

I currently have about $65,000 across savings / fairly liquid investment assets, zero debt, roughly $50k a year income, and my total monthly expenses average to $642/month but could technically be about half that. (I would like to plan around my expenses costing $1000/month however which I believe should be doable considering my frugal nature and willingness to live in LOCL or other countries).

With my savings rate and some fairly ordinary investment returns I believe I will hit $300,000 before I am 30 giving me my freedom budgeted at $1000/month. Since I am rushing to FIRE at 30 - I have been considering neglecting to invest in my ROTH IRA or doing so as a very low priority seeing as I am rushing towards a livable FIRE as fast as possible and any money thrown into a ROTH IRA is going to be essentially dead to me for decades still despite it being a great long-term investment. What do you think of delaying investments in a retirement account until after FIRE?

Speaking of, I think a very important part of my plan is that I do not plan to stop making income forever. I love self improvement, building my networth, investing, and most definitely a love for entrepreneurship. I expect my current income will continue as passive income of at least a few hundred dollars a month for the foreseeable future if I were to completely abandon it - but could easily sustain a thousand or two with very little work I think. 

I simply want to be able to progress in life at my own pace and pursue my passions without the worry of *NEEDING* to make money any time soon. So while I may spend a few months reading books, playing games, watching movies, whatever - it would never be exclusively that for years. It's more-so about the option to try and make an income with various ideas (ex: writing, YouTube, art, programming websites/apps, etc.) I'm passionate about and if it takes years or I fail multiple ideas that's okay. Ideally I expect to make significantly more than I do now within a few years of FIRE, but I want to play it on the safe side. Likewise I do not hope to live on $1000/month for the rest of my life. While I can be happy at that amount for a very long time, the goal would be to upgrade the quality of my FIRE slowly as I upgrade my networth and investments.

Does anyone have any stories of people who have gone down a similar path as I plan on? I would love to know how it panned out for others, see their budgets, read their story, and to take tips from more experienced people.

Am I trying to go too fast? Is $300,000 too ambitious even if I'm willing to eat rice and beans and never go outside while living in a studio apartment in Vietnam? Am I playing it too safe and should try to FIRE on $150,000 which should be able to last me over a decade of failing incredibly before finding success at my own pace?

**TL;DR: I want the freedom to spend my every day pursuing my passions at my own pace. My passions luckily should be very profitable long-term, but I want years and years to make sure I can try and fail at my own pace. Currently 25 and planning to FIRE at 30 when I plan to have $300,000 which I estimate I can live on [$1000/month] even if it's a poverty looking life to others. Is $300k the right number? Where can I find stories of people like me as opposed to people looking to FIRE on $2mil and watch Netflix for the rest of their life? Any tips?

**Portfolio Statistics Definitions**

**Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth:**
Illustrates the growth of earnings per
share over time. Earnings growth is
not a measure of a fund's future
performance.

&amp;nbsp;


**EPS Variability: **
Measures the variability of annual EPS over the last 10
years. A high EPS Variability number
indicates that the portfolio is more
heavily invested in companies with
volatile earnings streams.

&amp;nbsp;


**Return on Equity (ROE):**
 Is equal to a company’s after-tax earnings (excluding
non-recurring items) divided by its
average stockholder equity for the year.

&amp;nbsp;


**Price-to-Cash-Flow Ratio (P/CF):**
 A stock valuation measure calculated by
dividing a firm’s cash flow per share into
the current stock price. Financial analysts
often prefer to value stocks using cash
flow rather than earnings because the
latter is more easily manipulated.

&amp;nbsp;


**Price/Earnings Ratio:** 
The weighted average of the price/earnings ratios of
the equity securities referenced. The
trailing P/E ratio is calculated by dividing
current price of the stock by the
company's past year earnings per share.
Portfolio P/E – I/B/E/S 1 Year

&amp;nbsp;


**Forecast EPS:** 
This calculation uses median I/B/E/S (Institutional Brokers
Estimate System) consensus EPS
estimates for the next fiscal year to
calculate a P/E ratio. An adjustment is
made to accommodate different fiscal
year-ends and reporting time lags.

&amp;nbsp;


**Price/Book Ratio:** 
The weighted average of the price/book value of ratios
of the equity securities referenced. The
P/B ratio is calculated by dividing current
price of the stock by the company's book
value per share.

&amp;nbsp;


**Gross Dividend Yield:** 
This statistic reflects the annual rate at which
dividends have been paid for the
trailing 12 months, including extra
dividends. This is calculated by the
indicated annual dividend for each
stock divided by the price of the stock,
then taking the weighted average, and
therefore does not include the effect of
any Fund expenses.

&amp;nbsp;


**Standard Deviation:**
 A statistical measure of the historical volatility of
the pooled investment vehicle.

&amp;nbsp;


**Alpha:** 
The alpha of a mutual fund
describes the difference between a
fund’s actual return over a period of time
and its expected return, given the fund’s
level of risk. In this case, the risk profile
of the fund is measured by the fund’s
beta.

&amp;nbsp;


**Beta:**
 A measure of the volatility of the
fund’s total returns relative to the
general market as represented by a
corresponding benchmark index of the
fund. A beta of more than 1.00
indicates volatility greater than the
market, and a beta of less than 1.00
indicates volatility less than the
market.

&amp;nbsp;


**Sharpe Ratio:** 
A statistical measure that uses standard deviation and
excess return relative to a risk-free
investment to determine reward per
unit of risk. A higher Sharpe ratio
implies better historical risk-adjusted
performance.

&amp;nbsp;


**Expense Ratio:**
 A fund's operating expenses, expressed as a percentage
of its average net assets. Funds with
lower expense ratios are able to
distribute a higher percentage of gross
income returns to shareholders.",financialindependence,A help guide to understanding Portfolio Statistics Definitions,0

Initially I was devastated and wanted to pull my hair out. My heart was constantly heavy and I hated myself and screamed with frustration. That is over now. I’ve come to accept it and have moved on. Any advice where to go from here?

Age: 24
Salary: 90k
401k savings: 27k (10% company match, all in FXAIX)
Roth IRA: 18 (all in VTSAX)
No debt and no loans.

I try to live frugally and limit eating out. My hobbies are video games which are free/inexpensive. I try to save by only buying essential things and not falling victim to lifestyle inflation. I probably won’t be buying a car or anything any time soon (as I hear that is a very expensive thing to do)

My current net worth is ~70k (based on Mint)

Any advice on where to go from here? I’m scared of the stock market right now because everything seems so high and the economy seems unstable. But I’m getting serious FOMO from stocks and crypto currencies. 

Currently, I am maxing out my Roth IRA every year, and trying my best to max out my 401k (20% of salary) and get the company match as well. Should I even be maxing out my 401k? Should I reduce my contribution? Are there better things I should be doing with my money? What should I do with the rest of my money that isn’t going into Roth or 401k? Based on these stats am I on track for retiring early? Anything else I can do to set myself apart (major things like investing or even minor things like cutting corners and saving money). The 30k loss from the market truly hurt me mentally and of course financially, how bad is this in the grand scheme of things?

This [recent article](http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005905/for-young-chinese%2C-the-coolest-thing-to-do-in-2020-is-retire) by *Sixth Tone* summarises the situation on the ground quite nicely.

It's still more of an isolated subculture than a movement here. Very few young people will even have heard of FIRE in mainland China and the blocking of Reddit by the government certainly doesn't help. Nevertheless I think the ground is fertile for FIRE to spread (I apologise for the pun/mixed-metaphors) because (1) Chinese people are among the most materalistic and consumeristic in the world, and (2) the local work environment can be particularly oppressive. As the *Sixth Tone* article points out:
&gt; In some ways, FIRE appears a natural extension of a growing counterculture in China, where 80% of employees report feeling overworked, and young people are increasingly pushing back against unreasonable working hours.

There are some important differences in the environment for FIRE compared to the developing world:
* Interest rates are still substantially higher than in the West. 5-year Chinese government bond yields are at close to 2.7% compared with less than 0.3% for the equivalent US treasury. Even after rates moved lower this year, I can still put my money in a 3-month money market fund and get a 4% return. Of course you could argue that investors in the Chinese market take on a different and greater set of risks. Equities are a lot less reliable sources of return than in the US and most people put their money in property or bank-issued wealth management products.
* Because the cost of basic goods is generally low, a person can live on a pittance even in a major city as long as he/she doesn't splash out on fancy entertainment. In Shanghai, CNY30 (about USD4) in groceries could easily and sustainably feed a family of three, as long as they did all the cooking themselves. For some people the biggest costs are actually social obligations, such as giving money at weddings and at funerals, which is hard to escape. When my cousin got married a couple years back, for example, my parents and I gave him CNY20,000 (about USD2,800) as a wedding gift. For average relatives and close friends, you'd have to fork out a few thousand yuan at least. You can sort of see how you might run into liquidity issues if you have several friends or relatives getting married in a single month.
* Property prices here are among the most expensive in the world, and especially relative to income. In Shanghai, where I live, price/income is probably between 30-40x. This makes it hard for young people to achieve FI/RE, especially new comers to first or second tier cities who don't stand to inherit or be gifted property from their parents.
* The *hukou* system of household registration makes it hard for families to move around the country to take advantage of lower living costs. SInce social security benefits – the most important of which are education and healthcare – are tied to the city where you are registered, it's hard to move to another city unless you are wealthy enough to be able to afford private hospitals and private schools. This makes it easier for young people without children to embrace lean FIRE but much harder for a family with kids to do so.
* The social safety net is a lot less reliable than in most developed economies, so a person would need to save a lot more money to achieve financial independence. Again, quoting the *Sixth Tone* article: 
&gt; But China, with its basic social safety net, turbulent markets, and rapidly increasing cost of living, is also a risky place to play with FIRE. “A big illness could cut your savings in half,” says Li, the financial blogger.",financialindependence,Catching FIRE in China,0

All staples in our education system.

But wait a minute: have we been fooled?

How come Financial Education doesn't come up when we're schooled?

&amp;#x200B;

***""I don't want a nation of thinkers. I want a nation of workers.""***

Those are the words of John D. Rockefeller, widely regarded as the richest American of all time (yes, even richer than Jeff Bezos).

Clearly, Rockefeller would far rather have a bunch of mindless workers to employ and manipulate than having intelligent entrepreneurs to compete against him.

This mentality acted as the foundation for the current education system in America and indeed the globe: a system designed to condition students from a young age to sit down, shut up, do as they're told and perform repetitive tasks for 8 hours per day.

&amp;#x200B;

Intelligent citizens are difficult to control.

The more intelligent you are, the more likely you will know what the real issues are and that you are being Fed (pardon the pardon) a bunch of BS by a bunch of, shall we say degenerate, psychopaths. 

&amp;#x200B;

As Albert Einstein said: ***""Never confuse education with intelligence.""***

Being highly educated often times means being highly 'educat-able'.

This is not to say that *all* education is brainwashing, but people who excel in school tend to do so because they are highly trainable and therefore more susceptible to influence.

Add to this the cognitive blinders that come from being labelled as ""smart"" (i.e. believing that you are too intelligent to be fooled), and it's little wonder that academia has turned into an ideological robotic production line.

&amp;#x200B;

The aim of the education system is not to produce a well-rounded populace, but to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level of awareness, to suppress originality, to discourage critical thinking and imagination.

Then, there is the 'dumbing down' of an entire generation.

At one time, cultural movements such as hip hop were actually used to push positive messages to the youth, including the importance of financial independence and ownership. Now...not so much.

&amp;#x200B;

As well as this, we have a whole generation addicted to the dopamine loops of social media, many of which are effectively state-run spying apps.

Is this really appropriate for the progress of our civilisation - particularly in the 21 Century?

In 1902, the General Education Board was created after John D. Rockefeller donated an initial $1 million and he would later give over $180 million to fund the GEB. 

The GEB provided major funding for schools across America and was very influential in shaping the current education system.

I close with a quote from Frederick Gates, Rockefeller's business advisor and a prominent member of the GEB:

***""In our dream, we have limitless resources and the people yield themselves with perfect docility to our molding hand...***

***We shall not try to make these people or any of their children into philosophers or men of learning or of science. We are not to raise up among them authors, orators, poets, or men of letter. We shall not search for embryo great artists, painters, musicians nor lawyers, doctors, preachers, politicians, statesmen, of whom we have an ample supply…***

***The task we set before ourselves is very simple as well as a very beautiful one, to train these people as we find them to a perfectly ideal life just where they are.""***",financialindependence,Why Schools Don't Teach Financial Education,0

My ultimate goal is to retire early and achieve financial freedom. 


I am a 21 year old software engineer.

My salary is $75k a year.


I’ve had my credit card for 3 years and my FICO credit score is 770. I get 1% cash back so I make all of my purchases with my credit card and automatically pay it off with my debit card.

I have a Roth 401k through my company. I contribute 6% of every paycheck and my company matches 4% which is the max. I figured I’d use a Roth 401k to pay taxes on my contributions while I’m in a lower tax bracket while I’m young and to grow my retirement fund tax free. I also have a separate Roth IRA that I fully maxed out and I plan on fully maxing it out every year.

My monthly spending is $1000 and I save the rest. I don’t pay any kind of bills or rent because I live at home with my parents and I’ll be living at home for the next 3 years.


I have no debt. 


Should I be more focused on investing for growth, or saving for something like a house? 

Am I investing enough? Am I saving enough?
I only have one credit card. Should I sign up for more credit cards to build my credit or get a better cash back rate?

Was using a Roth 401k the right choice? Should I be contributing more to my 401k? 

Is investing in stocks wise? I’d like to buy tech stocks and sit on them for a while and hope they appreciate. 

Anything else I can do to achieve my goal?


Thanks in advance for any advice.",financialindependence,21 year old software engineer,0

Always a pleasure reading the many success stories, overcame struggles, and humble journeys many of you have shared in this space. I’ll try to keep my story short and hope I can pick the brains of the much more experienced of you all to find a path towards some peace. 

A few days back while scrolling through reddit I run into an imagine/story of your typical firer/rational low key frills family: went to work, spend below their means, and saved. Their net-worth got pretty nice and then Cancer hit one of the partners. Everything they built in years evaporated in months. Obviously this was in the US where despite having insurance, medical costs can still bankrupt you. I’ve experienced Something similar through the eyes of a close friend. 

I grew up low income, with an overcrowded house hosting multiple families and earning minimum wage. Through great family support, relationships outside of my own and a bit of luck I managed to finish school and found myself in a corporate white collar job. Since growing up living paycheck to paycheck and making the best of resources, one of the core principles of fire (keeping expenses low) wasn’t really that new to me. I already knew how to live next to nothing (by force), I just didn’t know what to do with all the savings. 

Anyway, I am thankful and have found myself, and despite Covid, still with a job and saving quite a bit of money. Through your readings and advice, there is no doubt that I will fire. However, I absolutely still have no safety net. Medical costs still give me nightmares and despite living a rather healthy life, I know illness does not discriminate. 

My question, for all you firers that have your budgets, your savings goals, etc and are now in great position, what are you doing to protect your assets in the rare case that unfortunate event happens?

At the end of the summer I opened my first brokerage account, and I recommended that he does the same.  But he didn't listen and spent his entire 5K on a top notch gaming PC.

I invested 1K each into TM, LLY, NVDA, BA, S (now T-Mobile), and BTU (went Chapter 11 in 2017). I never sold any of the companies and here's how much my initial 6K become as of today 9/5/2020:

* NVDA: $39,530

Obviously the tax benefits of a 401k are great when you’re 59 1/2 yrs old, but if I need access to that money to retire early, then I can’t get to it before then without a big penalty. 

I’m toying around with the idea of doing 3% in 401k for my employer match, but putting any other extra funds into a normal brokerage account so that I can fully access my money when I achieve my financial independence number. Otherwise it seems like the funds are locked away where I can’t get to them. Which defeats the purpose. 

I don’t think I’ve ever seen this topic discussed. It seems like everyone maxes out the 401k option first, before making any other separate investments. Well if I don’t make enough money to max out the yearly 401k allowance and then significantly invest outside of that, then I’ll never get to retire before 59 1/2.

Currently living in an apartment so naturally ~$50k could be used for a down payment on a house but I don't think I am ready for that as I feel that's a couple years off being in my early 20s.

So really in essence WWYD with ~$50k in cash if you 1) dont want to put in the market 2) and not buy a house? Could start up a business but don't quite have the desire or an idea at the moment.",financialindependence,Anyone else struggling w/ not being sure what to do with extra cash?,0

Currently a Full-Time Student going to an Honors College that pays my tuition, as well as being a Full-Stack Developer when I am not in school.

I am really stuck wondering if my pursuit of FI is stripping me from my identity. I grew up an athlete who was gifted academically. I played baseball since I was 4 or 5 years old all the way until my Sophomore year of college when I quit my Division II institution's team to work more since I had lost $8k in the stock market during the Spring of 2019 and it made me feel like if I didn't work I was screwed. I still had about $20k in cash, but I always told myself not to spend it. 

To put a little context on why I made those mistakes and put myself in the position to lose so much is because I live in an emotionally abusive household w a narcissistic Father so I really am just trying to move out--which in NYC you need a lot of money to even think about affording a house. I made a lot of emotionally driven, and therefore hasty, decisions which cost a heavy Stock Market Tuition.

Ever since I quit baseball, I have had an internship with a Government Agency where I am in my second year, they hired me at Graduate salary when I am undergrad, already gave me a raise, and I am working on super prestigious projects for my resume. Secondly, the entire office is essentially interns that got a job offer when they were in school. It is something that seems super promising for job/income security in the future--although I cannot say I would have sought to work there had I not been there already. I am not huge on office culture and the desk job scene, some days are worse than others, but if I were working only for a short period (I have until I graduate to make a decision--assuming they'd give me an offer) I can make do.

The only gripe I have is that there is not a day that goes by where I am not thinking about baseball, or wishing I could be playing or fitting it into my schedule. Granted, I did not enjoy getting up at 7am on the weekends to go practice, but after the practice it was alright. I have dreams about it, and when I see all my friends who I used to play with still playing it is gut wrenching.

It feels like an almost impossible situation to make a clear decision on, because playing Division II Baseball means I cannot have a job, and I can't take night classes, and I am giving all my free time up to baseball. I feel like a happy medium is just playing in a normal competitive league as I used to up until last summer, but I haven't been out there in so long and I've lost 20 pounds of muscle since I quit--it feels like a giant mountain I would have to climb.

Unfortunately, being a nerd and computer person, I don't naturally click with the typical college athlete anyways so I didn't form many personal relationships with my teammates which is one of the bigger reasons why it was to easy to quit, so it makes it even harder to get back out there when a lot of my friends wouldn't be there to throw a bullpen with, etc.

Theoretically, I could join the team back and play my junior year as if nothing happened because COVID-19 cancelled the entire season last year (so I technically missed nothing), but that would mean quitting my job and living off of my portfolio returns, putting off moving out, and only having my freelance income sustain my spending.

**Current Assets:**

\- $28k Brand New Car I bought in February (Fully Paid off)

\- $10k 2-year CD @ 1.5-2.8% APY (Don't Remember Exactly)

\- $20k Investment Portfolio

\- $2k Cash

**Yearly Expenses:**

\- $8-10k

**Current Income:**

\- $22-25k/Year

My goal was to have enough money to move out at or before the age of 25, but I feel like I am losing myself slightly. I really don't know how to figure this one out.

**TL;DR** I am 20 in NYC and I quit playing DII college sports to pursue working for FI and moving out of my toxic household, but not a day goes by I don't think about playing sports and I don't know how to play while still working toward FI at the same pace since I would have to quit my job and I don't have too many people I can play with since I am not a typical jock athlete as most seemed to be at my age.",financialindependence,Stuck Between a Rock and a Hard Place (20M),0

&amp;#x200B;

Just recently getting into this lovely concept and had some questions...First, here is what i am working with:

\-$44,500 in HYSA

\-$17k in 401k through employer (employer puts in 5% of my pay each check regardless of my contribution). I am on track to max this out this year. 

\-$7700 in traditional IRA, $865 in ROTH IRA

\- $140,000 student loan debt

\- Rent - $0, still living at home

I have my doctorates in physical therapy. Salary of \~$70k (lovely debt to income ratio). At my age, I regret that I got myself into that much debt to only make the salary I am, but it was my passion. With regards to my student loans, I work at a non-profit and have gotten my employment and my loans certified for PSLF. I have only made 9 payments thus far (relatively new grad). I have no problems working for a nonprofit for 10 years (in my profession, non-profit job quality is much better than private practice and pay is relatively similar). My questions:

\- Since I want to retire early, does it make much sense to max out my 401k/IRA? My monthly student loan payment is 10% of my income/12 months. The lower my AGI, the lower my student loan payment, but I also need to balance the fact that I would like that money for real estate and cannot touch it until I am of age. Or should  I continue to max out my IRA/401k to reduce my AGI and thus my monthly loan payment, maximizing my forgiveness after 10 years? Would love to contribute to ROTH since i am in a low tax bracket right now, but again, this would not decrease my AGI. 

\-Would it make more sense to only put in, say 10k to my 401k (or even less?), and use the remaining money to invest in real estate/stock market? 

\- Lastly, what should I do with my $44,500 in my HYSA. The interest rate has plummeted to .7%, so I have been wondering if I should put a chunk into a taxable account. Reason being I want to get into real estate (duplex house hacking) and am waiting on the right property to jump at. I could likely qualify for a FHA loan and only need 3.5% down.

This sub often talks about the financial aspects of receiving a windfall, but I want to focus on the emotional aspects of inheriting a large some of money for those who are struggling with the emotions that come with receiving a large sum.  Managing your emotions can be as equally important as managing your money and the two often go hand in hand. I would like to share a bit about two different paths that my brother and I took and share some of the emotional struggles I have had with receiving a large sum of money from a young age and how I manage those emotions. I hope that this post can help other people who might have similar feelings to what I have experienced.

**Brief Background**

When I was in my first year of college, about 10 years ago, my final grandparent passed away. My brother and I received a lot of money, about 750k each.  By the time I received full ownership of the money at 25 years old, it had grown to 1.2 million due to most of the money already being invested.  

**What each of us did after receiving the inheritance**

My brother has always been a hard worker and it’s something I admire him for.  He was working in a dead end job he more or less enjoyed, but that didn’t pay well.  He decided to pursue something else a few years after receiving the money and went for his masters degree. He now works at a stable job that pays pretty well and that he loves.  He lives in a HCOL area and put down a large down payment on a wonderful house. When I was renting a room from him, he would leave early in the morning and get home later.  He probably put in 50+ hours every week and up to 60+ at times for the first couple of years.   As I said, my brother is a hard worker. There were many days or weeks that were very stressful and he was exhausted when he got home.  But now that he is more settled in the job, he takes off more from work to do the things he wants to do and indulges in some of his more expensive hobbies.  He has no intention of quitting his job and continues to gain a steady income.  On this sub, this is the recommended path. Work like you would have done if you hadn’t received a windfall and enjoy the benefits of it growing.   

For those of you like me who struggle with the recommended path I’ll share what I have done. I completed college and hopped around trying different jobs. First, I worked a job in my field of study.  Then I worked in retail for a bit before I tried a different type of job in my field of study.  I ended up having a mental breakdown in that job.  My next career decision took me to a low cost of living country where I now work teaching English.

For whatever reason, I have really struggled with working full time and adapting to adult life.  It could be argued that my inheritance has contributed to that as in full time jobs it’s really hard to stay motivated when rent and satisfying basic needs is not a concern if I leave my job.  It’s easy to transition the thought of “this isn’t worth it” into action.  It’s not that I’m a bad worker.  I always arrived on time to my shifts and rarely slacked off.  But after awhile in a job I start to realize the job isn’t really fulfilling and working for my mental health, and so I look for the next thing that I think will give me a sense of fulfillment.  Therefore, I don’t know if I would have adapted to full time work even if I hadn’t received my inheritance.

**Guilt**

There are some problems that come with receiving a lot of money.  I’m not saying these problems are worse than other peoples.  Just that there are problems and one of the main ones is the feelings of guilt that can come from receiving a large sum.   Over the years, I have felt a lot of guilt, whether from personal or societal pressures. I’m sure some of these aren’t only exclusive to people who have received money, but I still want to share them as I think they are pretty common among people who have received a windfall and are experienced to varying degrees at different times. Here is a list of some of those things:

1)feeling like I don’t deserve and didn’t earn the windfall.

2)feeling like I’m wasting my potential if I don’t do something special with the opportunity the money has given me.

3)feeling like my achievements are lesser than others.

4)feeling like I have to solve other people’s financial problems.

5)feeling bad for spending any of the money.

6)feeling like I’m not allowed to have problems.

Include separate for not having to struggle like other people?

**What has helped me with the guilt.**

It’s important to work on these feelings of guilt because if you don’t, you risk the chance of making unintelligent decisions.  Here are some things that have helped me in the past.

1) It’s really interesting how we view what people deserve or don’t deserve.  People tend to think good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people, but the reality is a lot of life is random. So we might look at people working hard to get the same amount of money that was given to us and we feel guilty for not having to make the sacrifices they do. After all, we aren’t better than them so why do we deserve to not work like they do? But remember that the person who chose to give it to you deserved to give their money to whoever they wanted to. So I think it’s important to be constantly thankful for the people or person that gave it to you.  I feel less guilty when I see that money as something that was given to me so I could pursue whatever I want in life that makes me feel fulfilled and happy.  

Also, one of the things my therapist challenged me on is how to think about the idea of earning money. Have I earned my initial net worth by showing up at a job and exchanging my labor for money? No.  But all the additional earnings that my investments make, is earned money in a sense.  Not in the traditional sense, but in the sense that every dollar of gains is from money I chose not to spend, even when I could.  

2) The idea of potential is often associated with career, but that is only one aspect of your potential.  But because people mainly focus on career potential, people will judge you if you don’t use your money to further yourself in your career or to start a business.  There is really only one potential in your life that I believe matters, and that’s feeling fulfilled and satisfied with life.  So do whatever brings you long term fulfillment and figure out what is truly important for you and distinguish that from what other people think you should be doing.  For me, it’s working for some of my own money while also having a lot of free time to pursue my hobbies and activities.  This obviously changes over time so just be aware that what brings you satisfaction now will probably be different even a couple years from now.  

3) Guilt about potential plays a bit into guilt about achievements.  It’s easy to look at other people’s achievements and compare them to your own.  When I compare myself to what other people are doing with their lives, it’s easy to think I’m not doing enough and this is amplified with the false belief that because I have the financial resources to do anything I want, it means that I could do anything in life. When really it means that I can pursue anything that I am willing to make sacrifices for.  It’s easy to look at another person’s income on this sub and think ‘wow, if only I put in the effort like that person, I could make 150k+ too.’ But in reality, you don’t know the true amount of effort that that person has put to get there, effort that you might not even be capable of.  You don’t know how many things that person had to sacrifice, the amount of stress they endured, or their goals that motivated them to achieve that level of income.

But you know what you have sacrificed for your own personal achievements and they are things you can be proud of.  While it’s important to recognize other people’s achievements, it’s also important to recognize your own achievements and to take the time to be proud of them.

4)  My first reaction, and maybe yours too, to hearing someone having financial difficulties is to want to help them.  And if I were to feel guilty about the money I have, I would probably feel obligated to help them out financially.  But constantly doing that would set me on the path to giving all of my money away and prevent me from reaching my own goals.  I have found that most of the time, people end up solving their financial problems on their own and are really just looking to vent. Even just offering a listening ear is often a good enough way to help out your friends and family.

Now I’m not saying don’t ever give money to help people.  I think charity and helping out friends and family is noble and it is something I would like to do more of at some point in my life when I feel more income stable.  What I am saying is don’t ever feel obligated to give money to other people if you don’t want to or aren’t comfortable with it.  Personally, I have my own financial and life goals and I’m not comfortable giving away large sums. But, if charity is very important to you, select an amount you are comfortable donating or donate some time to help out.  

5) This can especially play off the feeling of not deserving the money you received.  So if you buy anything with ‘unearned’ money then you didn’t really earn that object and you shouldn’t be allowed to enjoy something that you didn’t earn.  But that type of thinking ruins the joy for anything that you spend money on, which is a lot of things in this life.  While I’m not advocating for spending without any care in the world, I am advocating for guilt free spending.   

To help prevent overspending, it’s important to still have a budget no matter your level of wealth.  Find an amount you are comfortable with spending per month/year and stick to that budget.  For me, I take out enough money to cover my basic needs and a little extra fun money, but I still leave enough to let my windfall continue to grow.  It can be easy to go over the budget when looking at your bank balance, but this is where a lot self-discipline comes into play.  This has serves two purposes: It prevents you from buying things frivolously and over time eroding your windfall.  And it also creates an artificial constraint where you begin to want to earn money.  As I said earlier, having such a large windfall has made money less of a motivation for me, but when I feel a constraint on spending, even an artificial one, it makes me want to earn money with my own skills.  The only exception I make is for important medical related things.

Developing some sort of professional skills is good and I really recommend any sort of skill that can be freelanced if you struggle with full time work.  It has been important for me to acknowledge that I wouldn’t have been able to pursue this kind of career path had I not received my inheritance.  Feeling like I am still having to use my own skills to earn additional money has given me quite a lot of personal satisfaction.

6) For the final point of not feeling like I can have my own problems. People are judgmental.  It’s a fact of life.  And people tend to look at those who have been very fortunate as not being allowed to complain about things or have their own problems.  But that’s not true.  Are my problems as stressful as someone who has to worry about not making rent and barely being able to feed their family?  Hell no! But someone having a more stressful situation than me doesn’t make my problems any less problematic for me.  So it’s okay for you to struggle with the guilt and other emotions that can come with having received a large windfall.   

**Conclusion**

I hope some of the things I have written can help you a bit to navigate the emotions with receiving an inheritance or windfall.

Cash flow/expenses: So we were living with a roommate but it naturally ran it’s course. We recently locked into a lease at $1500 monthly for 2 years for an entire floor of a brownstone in Brooklyn (it’s truly a blessing) 
So there’s 2 new major changes in our cash flow.

Savings/investments: For the last year we saved about $2000 a month on average. With the new changes it’s an projected gross savings of $2500 a month

We can buy a multi unit, live there and Airbnb the other units (mortgage would be $150k-300k but Airbnb regulations are ironed out in Mexico) we can probably rent out an apartment for $40 a night (4 unit owner occupied would have a $2400 gross income at 66% occupancy)

We can buy a house upstate in a college town in which I commute at first then we eventually rent it out during the semester while living in Mexico and alternate during the summer (ideal living for me)

He has a vested pension if about 450k as well as a 401(k). The question here is we don’t know what to do as far as payout for that. He will be 62 in two months and thats will be when he can start to collect retirement money but not 100% until he’s 67. He has terrible health (alcoholic and recently was hospitalized bc he depression drank bc he lost his job). We are worried he won’t live long enough to collect his full pension. He has a full year of money saved for an emergency fund, he’s also getting a hefty severance package that’s worth another year of expenses, and in 2 months he can collect social security. Not to mention his house is paid off as well as he and his wife vehicles. He’s well off but still depressed bc he can’t work. There are three options:

1. He can collect his pension in payouts and if he dies the money stops.

2. He can collect the pension with his wife as a co-collector but will get less money in payouts (she has bad health too, 2 strokes in less than a year apart). When they both die, the money stops.

3. Lump sum the pension and roll it over to the 401k. They will take 20% of the value of the pension which we were told is around 90k if they select the cash out option. If they roll it over i think they won’t have to pay taxes on it . If they cash it out and not roll it over the. It will be taxed by the government as well. 

What should they do? I think cashing out and rolling over to the 401k or an Roth IRA is the best situation.",financialindependence,"Cash out pension, take payments, or roll it over?",0

I'm still not fully back in the market.  Don't be like me.  

We all know how it should work.  Pick your asset allocation.  Squirrel away.  Rebalance.  Do some roth conversions. Keep living costs low. Build a tent to mitigate sequence of returns risk.  Sail off into the sunset.   

I could go into why I decided to sell everything and buy US Treasuries, but by this time in my journey, I should have known better.  But I did on April 1, 2020.  

Fortunately I had a plan to get back in, but that plan did not indicate re-entry until August 1, 2020.  But by then psychology was already working against my best interests, ""I can't get back in now! Near the highs?""  

So I determined to reinvest in 5 chunks.  I would set limit orders 2-4% off recent highs and if those didn't trigger by month end I would change them to market orders to ensure entry.  Well August saw no such pullback.  7% higher.  

$#@!  I put in August's 1/5 chunk and set orders for Sep, which all got filled yesterday in the sell off.  So I am 40% back into my standard 80/20 portfolio.  

I made a spreadsheet with my positions on March 31, 2020.  I compared that to the same portfolio on August 31, 2020.  The portfolio I liquidated was worth $1.4M.  That same portfolio would be worth$1.7M untouched on August 31.  

I missed out on $302,659.98 of capital gains.  To say nothing of the dividends I missed out on nor the tax implications of what I did in March.  

Some perspective: 

* That money invested would pay for college tuition for my 2 children just about anywhere for 4 years when they turn 18.
* That loss will likely push off my retirement by 3-5 years
* Or if I keep the same target date, I will have to spend about $25k/year less in retirement.
* Or I could have just quit my job, bought a yacht, and sailed the world for the last 5 months and have been better off.  

I know we like to say that financial advisors are too expensive, not worth it, etc, but someone who had simply said ""Don't be a muppet and stay the course"" would have earned 19 years' worth of fees.  

This is the behavior gap: the difference between what an asset class earns and what an irrational/fearful investor earns investing in the same asset class.  It is real.  It is expensive.  Good luck closing it.

I have historically just put everything into VTSAX, but I have learned that my employer doesn't offer this through vanguard. They offer several target retirement accounts--which I have no interest in, and then they offer the following:

* VIIIX (large cap)
*  VMCPX  (mid cap)
*  VSCPX (small cap)
*  VTPSX (Int'l)
*  VBMPX (total bond market)

If I understand VIIIX--it's basically just S&amp;P 500. It seems pretty simple to me, put 85% into VIIIX, as this would be as close to VTSAX as possible. 10%-15% in VTPSX for international exposure, and maybe 5% into VBMPX. I would like to keep no more than 10% into bonds for now as I'd like to be aggressive during these early years. But I would like to hear people's opinions.

Tbh, I think the reason why I hadn't started investing earlier, 4 years ago right after graduation, was due to just pure ignorance and anxiety about not knowing what to do. Since graduating, I merely put in my employer match (5%) in my 401k within my pre-tax contribution but that was it.

About me: I'm 27, I am blessed to be the child of amazing, hardworking parents who paid for my education and car (they are asian though, so i'm also unfortunately subscribed to [r/raisedbynarcissists](https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/)), so no debt. My company uses vanguard retirement account.

After a lotttttt of lurking and research/reading as well as pressure from people saying I should have started investing at the start of covid, here's what I did:

1.) calculated how to max out my 401k \[divided $19,500 but my total gross income\] and maxed out my 401k accordingly.

2.) very recently opened a roth ira account, and maxed that out to the limit ($6000). I threw it into VTSAX and VFTSX, but i wish i could diversify more and throw it into other vanguard mutual funds that were more bond focused, cause i did read that roth ira benefits more with bond contributions, however the minimum for both VTSAX and VFTSX is $3000 each so I unfortunately could only buy those two. I suppose i'll have to wait 'til next year to buy other mutual funds.

3.) once i maxed out my roth ira, i opened a brokerage account within vanguard and bought $3000 worth of stock of each of the following (except for VTSAX):

VBIAX VDIGX VFIAX VGHCX VIGAX VWUSX XLY RTH ARKK VTSAX (I bought $11,000 worth of stock)

I've read that I should've opened up a HSA account before opening a brokerage account. Don't know much about that yet, but before I do so I'll have to read more about it and why I should. For now though, I'm just happy to have gotten started and now my money isn't just sitting in my savings account (the cardinal sin!).

Other future thoughts: I've been lurking [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and it has unfortunately tempted me to start reading about options. I understand it is indeed gambling and predicting the market at the end of the day, but I can't help but think that's pretty easy to do pending any crazy events (e.g. walmart, apple, and tesla calls).

Other backstory about me you absolutely do not have to read: I'm single, and don't plan to buy a home very soon. My parents' home is 5 minutes from my office. I work in procurement/supply chain/project management within the tech/government industry. I like my job. It's basically 90% remote, only requiring me to be face to face probably just a 2 or 3 times a year. I've thought long and hard about where I want to live and whether or not to buy a home somewhere. But given the circumstances of my job, I cannot go 100% remote and I must occasionally visit the office that is 5 minutes away from my parents' home. And I've further concluded that I cannot, in good conscience, buy a home in this area (DC, md, VA). I mean I definitely don't wanna live at home with my parents for the rest of my life. But at the same time, homes are so expensive in the area; on top of that, rising sea levels are gonna lower the value of homes close to the coast, so it wouldn't be a good ultra-long-term investment for me.

With that being said, I am very much considering to do a bit of traveling and ""van-dwelling"" across the country by myself. And I am thinking about splurging on a used Tesla model S p100d. Yes I don't need the performance model, and yes I've read how much of a financial mistake buying a car is (especially one that's \~$70000).

Always self questioning. Always doubting and get really anxious watching financial news.
So I let it go.

Some years later, I get a little older, more mature in many ways.
I was determined to get into the market again because I know it's a great way of diversifying and I have to learn. Maybe if I know it, I'll understand it better and be less afraid.

Some days as I'm reading, EVERYTHING would go over my head. Everything was so confusing and nothing made sense. The financial world was a really scary place for me. But I pushed through, as hard as I can. I'm at the point in my life where I am quite confident in the financial decisions I make but I definitely would never give out investing advice. I'm not THAT confident that I can risk other people's money.
All in all I'm really grateful that I'm in that position where I can invest and persevered with the learning.

I didn't even realise. I'm one of those set and forget people. Occasionally looking when there's a huge crash or swing just, not to stress, but just so I can express ""whoa, that's a lot"". That's off topic.
The last time I checked I was getting $2-400 in total dividends for the year so I assume it's been that way for some time. To my surprise and the magic of compounding interest, I logged in to find $6,130.61 in dividends has been paid to me for FY20.

It's a pretty cool feeling. I'm feeling pretty chuffed. 
But I also acknowledge that life is very unfair.
I'm earning $6,139.61 for doing nothing, whilst there are people out there who have lost their jobs and are struggling to eat.
Strange place this world. That we've allow numbers on a computer screen to determine our life quality. But that's off topic.

&amp;nbsp;

I recently read Thomas Piketty’s work [Capital in the 21st Century](https://www.amazon.com/Capital-Twenty-First-Century-Thomas-Piketty/dp/0674979850). Piketty argues that much of economic history can be understood by analyzing the ratio of wealth to income. He uses tax records and datasets from European countries and the United States going back several hundred years. While the book is long and dense, I found it fascinating. Key points include:

&amp;nbsp;

* In pre-industrial societies, economic growth is basically non-existent, or only very slowly outpaces population growth.

&amp;nbsp;

* Since the industrial revolution, invested wealth has typically grown faster than the incomes of the majority of working people. This mathematically and inevitably leads to inequality.

&amp;nbsp;

* Approximately half of the population own nothing or very little. This pattern repeats across countries and at every level. For example, if you again break down the the top half of the population (those with assets), the top half of that half (overall the top quarter) own most of the wealth. This repeats until you reach Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos.

&amp;nbsp;  

* In the era before the world wars, inflation was very low or non-existent. Returns (typically on government bonds, the favored investment) were around 4%. An interesting note comes from Victorian era novels when incomes and portfolio sizes are referred to interchangeably. An income of 20,000 pounds translates to a 500,000 pound portfolio and vise-versa. After the world wars, novelists stopped making these comparisons, and generally stopped mentioning actual monetary values in print, since they would become quickly outdated. 

&amp;nbsp; 

* The world wars and depression destroyed much of the world order, including the concentrated fortunes of the wealthy. Governments during and after the wars paid for the tremendous debts incurred in a variety of ways, including very high tax rates and by simply printing more money and devaluing their debts (along with the fortunes of the wealthy).

&amp;nbsp;

* The post war economic climate is a historical anomaly – many fortunes were destroyed, and much of the world was actually destroyed. This leveling had several effects – there were very few fortunes that were passed down by inheritance and the generation that grew up in that period saw their labor as a higher proportion of national income compared to invested wealth. Coupled with the rise of mass higher education and highly paid professional careers gave boomers a new way to the top – income instead of inheritance.

&amp;nbsp;

* Since the late 1970’s, the historical pattern of wealth accumulation and inequality has reasserted itself.

&amp;nbsp;

* In the postwar era, the long term rate of return on invested capital is still approximately 4%. The calculation is complicated by inflation but generally holds.

&amp;nbsp;


To combat the inevitability of the very few eventually owning everything (more so than they already do), Piketty advocates for a globally coordinated progressive tax on wealth. Otherwise, “the past will eat the future”, or those few that are lucky enough to be born into historical family wealth will dominate the rest.

&amp;nbsp;


As someone striving for FI, this work was very illuminating. Basically I am trying to jump on this historic inevitability of invested wealth growing faster than labor, and living off the proceeds. I find it interesting that the 4% rule has held for many centuries, and that the “OK Boomer” meme has something to it – their life experiences were shaped by a very different and historically anomalous economic climate.

I don't plan on doing that, I plan on continuing to save and invest. 

I max out 401k contributions. My salary is right on the cusp of not being eligible for a Roth IRA, but still maxing that out while I can. Following the standard guidance of continuing to max out tax advantaged accounts, I should probably start looking at mega back door options next.

However, I'm considering putting some money into a taxable account and was curious when others in this community started using them. 

I'm viewing it three ways.  First, is to build a passive income stream to get to the FI part of FIRE. The second is the RE part of FIRE, as a source of income for early retirement. The third is not necessarily viewing it as a retirement vehicle, but rather putting my money to work that I can access before retirement (I know that you can withdraw Roth contributions, but would rather just leave that alone).  I could use the money for home renovations, to purchase an investment property, save for some future epic vacation - whatever it may be, and it would have a much better return than sitting in a savings account.

I really want to get to the point where I have more time on my hands and that I don't spend most of my life on something I don't really care about (working).

I don't know if it's possible (maybe I'm starting too late) but I would really want to be FIRE by the age of 35 - 40 (of course if it's not possible any age after that is ok lol)  
I think the amount that will be enough for me would be $5M which I would spend about $4.5K+ a month for the rest of my life.

I currently a fullstack developer in a company and I think about maybe advance to a team-leader in a year or so if I would have the option.  
Basically I don't need to spend money of any education for my profession, I mostly learn online and I actually have enough knowledge to get by.

* Food: 300$
* Bills: 250$
* Friends Hangouts: 200$
* Therapy: 500$
* Travel: 250$
* Courses (for hobbies): 250$

Currently I have $12K in savings (sadly I wasn't handling money well before...)

also I've been thinking to do several things to maybe get some passive income

* writing a book - I have a nice life story event that happened to me and people said it could make a good book / movie
* I'm trying to build a mobile game with a friend which might give us something from ads/in-app purchases
* I have a nice idea for an app that might be also an option
* I thought of maybe starting to invest in the stock market a bit

**Introduction:**

I've been lurking this subreddit for a long while and read many, many stories and posts of peoples FIRE journey, different types of situations, etc. I don't remember exactly when I joined this subreddit but I've been meaning to become smarter financially and hopefully become financially independent sooner rather than later. I'm 22\[M\] and will be graduating from university next year. I'm dumb and wish I had started learning/applying this years ago but I've been really lazy about it; the stress and anxiety of graduating and adulting full-time is what finally pushed me to do this lol. 

I know everyone has a sob story of their own and you've probably read this sort of thing many times, but I'll say my piece anyway for more background info. Basically my family (my mom and dad, an older brother and younger sister) is from Pakistan and immigrated to Canada a little over 10 years ago. My dad finished his PhD about 5 years ago and went back to Pakistan because the university he was working at has been holding an associate professor position for him. So its just been me, my mom, and 2 siblings for a while now. We've been below the poverty line throughout the years, although things have gotten slightly better in more recent years when my brother and I finally entered university and got a few Co-op jobs.

&amp;#x200B;

**Age**: 22\[M\]

I'm currently on my way to completing my bachelors in Biomedical Engineering. Will hopefully graduate next year.

**Location**: Canada, Ontario

&amp;#x200B;

**Target FIRE Age**: Tbh I'm not sure, I would like to be independent by around my 30s

**Educational Background:** I'll be graduating next year with a bachelors in biomedical engg. However, I do like programming and currently   
learning on my own. I hope to get a software development job or an engineering job involving medical devices.

**Career Situation:** I have a Co-op job right now as a manufacturing technician at a biotechnology company, but my term will end this december and then I will move onto my final study semester

**Income:** At my current co-op job I make $16 an hour, 40 hrs per week. this will last almost 4 months (till december 2020).

**Budget breakdown:** I have about $10K in my account (i'm with TD)

**Debt breakdown:** This part hurts me inside a little lol. I estimate I'll be around $26K in debt by the time I graduate

**Asset breakdown:** I own no assets

**Health Concerns:** No health concerns so far

**Family/Other Info:** As I mentioned above, it's just me, my mother, and my older brother (who'll be graduating at the same time as me) and my younger sister (about to graduate hs next year). It's been tough for my mom to find a job since coming to Canada (Pakistani degrees aren't that powerful i guess idk) but she has had luck very recently. She got a job offer as a teacher but it requires her to move about 6 hours away from us. If she is able to move then it'll be me and siblings staying put and my mom will move away. She'll pay for her residence there, and my brother and I will take on a joint lease here (we live in an apartment provided by a non-profit organization from my city). My brother has a study term this semester and next semester, so I don't see him working. My job will end december and I'll start a study semester next term. I'll try to get a part-time job at a walmart nearby, we'll see how that goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Questions:**

I guess what I'm looking for is a game plan/future steps to ensure my own and my family's wellbeing financially. I don't want to just keep my money laying around.

Next year I'll have to start paying my education debts off. I think recently Ontario removed the 6 months grace period that students get after graduating and have to start paying it right away. Hopefully I secure a job. I'd like to know more about this and what to do. Maybe any tips you could provide that could make the path to being debt free quicker and easier? I'd also like to pay off my mom and dads debts too once I'm out of mine.

This kinda bounces off the first ""question"": like I said, I don't want my money just laying around. I want to get into stocks/shares and bonds. Do you think this is a good idea for me? Should I save up a certain amount before getting into this?

This is related to banks and savings rates. I'm currently with TD and would like to know if I should move my money elsewhere or if there are any other tips in general. I did a bit of research and found two other banks that seem decent: Tangerine and EQ. What I'm confused about is the savings rate. For example, if they say the savings rate is 2% and I put in $10K into a savings account, does that mean I get $200 put into my account per month? (I know this is probably a dumb question lol).

Also, is it a good idea to keep increasing my credit limit?

A little bit about myself: Currently living in HCOL city on the east coast, hoping to gain some work experience for a few years, before transferring to a cheaper city to accelerate FIRE. Married but kids are years away. Spouse works in an arts and humanity field, is good with money and on board with FIRE in general, but doesn’t really care/think about money and investing as much as I do (I’m sure quite a few of you guys can relate:). I recently landed my first full-time job out of grad school, starting at 70k + bonus, and I am on track to raise that to 80k within the first year. My field is comparatively recession-proof, has pretty good growth potential (hoping to break 6 figures in a couple years), and jobs are abundant in lower cost of living locations as well.

Net worth is around 95k. No debt and no car payments. Currently holding $50k between retirement accounts and brokerage (half equity half fixed income for now), and another $45k in cash. Higher than usual emergency fund because of *gestures at everything this year*, and also starting to save for a potential down payment. We recently opened Roth IRA’s, and plan to start maxing them out once I start working in January. We’re both relatively frugal, but love to travel when it’s safe to do so. 

I’m toying with eventually doing some house-hacking when we buy our first home, or investing in a separate multi-family. I don’t know enough about real estate, so we’re sticking to index funds for now.

Morgan Housel says in the book that he saves a higher portion of his net worth (I think it was 20%) than most people his age (30s). In the chapter about saving, he talked about the fact that most people see saving as a task unto a specific expected purchase: a down payment, a car, etc. He argues that saving is good enough on its own merit -- doesn't require a specific goal -- because having a large liquid net worth gives you more protection and options.

My dad is getting old and Ik he most likely doesn’t have a retirement plan. He’s African and typically Africans and a lot of foreigners retirement plan is their children supporting them. I feel really guilty for not financially supporting him and letting him retire. Right now I have to pay rent and bills so it will be a real struggle to support him as well. I could move back in with him but honestly I’m so tired of living in the hood. My dad never wanted to leave the hood. He’s been there over 20 years despite his car being burned down and having our house robbed multiple times. I’m so conflicted, I want to support him but I realize if I do I’m going to have to spend the rest of my youth in the hood when I’ve finally kinda moved away from it. He had another kid in his 50s which probably wasn’t the best decision. So she won’t be 18 for another 10 years also even if she’s 18 that doesn’t mean she’ll suddenly be able to support her self. She probably won’t get a degree or good job until she’s at least 25 so that’s 17 years away. I feel like an asshole not supporting my family but if I do support my father, step mother and little sister that means realistically I won’t be able to start a family of my own until I’m in my 40s. Because there’s no way I could support a wife and kid while supporting 3 other people. Honestly idk what to do. Ik it’s fucked up but I just wished in all this time he could’ve started a 401k or some type of retirement plan for himself. Ik the reality is I’m probably gonna have to put my life on hold for over the next decade to take care of him and his wife and my sister.

Meaning...you’re actually overestimating when calculating using 1.07^30. An average extra 0.28-0.3% per year is being added depending on how long out you calculate. 

Yeah yeah I understand why the approximation works because 8.8% over 30 years is actually a pretty small error to add to the calculation compared to what the market uncertainty is.

Idk why, but I originally thought Monthly Maintenance Fees were always waived because they were just something the bank does to test everyone's account to see that they were working. Mine were always getting waived, so I paid no mind  to them.

What I'm wondering is how are my Monthly Maintenance Fees getting waived? The conditions are:

* You have $25,000 in combined personal deposits or credit balances[1](https://www.usbank.com/bank-accounts/checking-accounts/platinum-interest-checking-account.html#1) with U.S. Bank, and/or investments\* through U.S. Bancorp Investments.
* You have a personal trust relationship with U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

I don't nearly have $25,000 in US Bank on any of my accounts or credit balances (I pay off my balance every month). And I have no idea what the second bullet point means. Even after looking it up, it seemed really vague.

I ask this, because recently I opened up an account with an online bank, Varo (again, after one of Graham's videos), and I transferred my direct deposit to this bank. I'm worried about getting charged these Monthly Maintenance Fees now, and I'm trying to figure out why they are getting waived in the first place. If I have to pay a $25 monthly maintenance fee, I'd rather close the account, but I originally wanted to keep it open if I ever needed to deposit cash.

So I guess to summarize:

* Any idea what could be causing the monthly maintenance fee to be getting waived (for the past 18 months according to my statements)?
* Does it actually hurt me to keep my US Bank Checking / Savings open even though I will mainly be banking with Varo. Also, some of my credit cards are with US Bank.",financialindependence,"Specific Advice Needed Concerning Monthly ""Maintenance Fees""",0

I really couldn't find a savings calculator that fit the plan that my wife and I are working towards. We want to aggressively save, then back off and CoastFIRE while we spend time traveling and working remotely. Most retirement calculators I've found either make you pop in a fixed savings amount per year, or have some % increment per year number. There just wasn't enough flexibility. And sometimes they just don't give you enough numbers to go along with it.

[So I created my own spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1h4euUifOWF63JuU5dDkJlWThcQuoqIKzBL1UakRdPcA/edit#gid=0).  You can enter in an initial value for this year (since it's almost over), and then enter a savings amount (or withdrawal amount) for each year and it will calculate your total account balance, interest earnings, 4/3/2% safe withdraw, and then 4/3/2 adjusted for inflation (with an inflation modifier at the bottom if you want to change it, currently 2%/yr).

Feel free to use it, share it, steal it and put it on your blog. But I was hoping some of you fancier excel folk could give me some feedback and let me know if there's anything else that should be added that might help some people.

Grew up in a poor family.  Got myself to college with loans in STEM degree and have grinded my way to a well paying job.  i’ve always paid off all my debts as soon as i can and i always save up money on a roth and 401k every month.  i lived very frugally.  Bought a small house in my late 20s after saving up for a down payment.

Eventually got married to someone with 200k  (7% interest) medical school debt.  we fought occasionally about finances with my mortgage and her loans - but eventually she got a decent job and we had an aggressive plan to pay it all off in 4 years and we did it but living frugally and paying aggressively.  Mid 30s now with maybe 300K in retirement, 20k maybe in our banks but at least we were free of the medical school debt.

then we had a kid.  she quit her job.  finances went even harder now and we fight all the time - kids will ruin that connection between two folks quick.  we weren’t happy

then 2020 was a weird year.  now i’ve had experience with the stock market, trading a bit when i was younger and i read up on how things work with options years ago. so the march crash was a shock but from previous 2008 crash examples, i figured i just fear is the best time to buy and bought long dated calls on tesla and amazon.  

well the rest is history, gained about 2.5 million dollars (after taxes) and never in my wildest dreams did i think i’d be here.  the first and only thing i did was pay off my parents mortgage and my wife’s parents mortgage.  did absolutely nothing for ourselves except nowadays we dont search for coupons or wait for sales as hard as we used to.  i put the case in bonds and dividend stable stocks...

but i’m still just working everyday like it’s just another day.  i just can’t switch myself mentally to start spending or live differently because i’ve grinded my whole life.  i feel like it’s just going to sit there until i die and then gets divided to whoever is my benefactor.  and i’m certainly not happy still.

I’ll break this down first with my assets and liabilities, then what my ideas are, then ask what you think might be a better road to travel.

1. I have my IRA, index fund, personal brokerage, and cash accounts totaling around 185k.

2. I only have one CC bill that auto-pays from my s-corp’s checking acct.

3. have 130k left on a 182k loan. I spent the first couple years aggressively paying this down before a few financially independent friends indicated that Its the cheapest money to leverage; therefore I should take excess principle and put it into an investment account. Currently the house is showing on Zillow for about 420k.

My net worth comes in around ~475k after liabilities are accounted for.

My initial idea: My house has a small studio that I used to rent out long term but switched over to AirBNB. I’m about to engage with a property manager to let him deal with this for me. 

If that covers the mortgage, I could easily take on $135 HELOC to build a proper ADU in the back. Rent out the top floor of my primary dwelling long term (studio a), continue renting AirBNB (studio b), and do long term with the ADU (studio c). This could yield about 69k gross that I could use to fold into mortgage, HELOC, and index fund source. (Perhaps fold this into another property?)

|Year|2013|2014|2015|2016|2017|2018|2019|2020|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|% of total|4%|10%|21%|34%|43%|52%|45%|45%|

My side gig income has enabled me to accelerate my path to FIRE.  I have always maxed out my IRA, but because of this side gig, in 2015 I maxed out my 403b contributions for the first time, and since 2016, I have maxed out my 403b, 457b, Roth IRA and my three kids' Coverdell College Savings accounts every year.

So those of you with side gigs, what is your side gig and how does your side gig fit into your FIRE plans?    


What % of your income is your side gig?   How have you seen that % change over the past few years?",financialindependence,Growing a side gig to catch FIRE,0

&gt;Your plan allows a Coronavirus (CARES Act) Distribution. If you qualify for a Coronavirus (CARES Act) Distribution, you must take this transaction before requesting any available hardship withdrawals. You may be eligible for this distribution if you, your spouse, or dependent have been diagnosed with COVID-19, or if due to COVID-19 you have experienced adverse financial consequences because you, your spouse, or a member of your household was quarantined, furloughed or laid off, or had work hours reduced; was unable to work due to lack of childcare; a business owned or operated by you, your spouse, or a member of your household closed or reduced hours; ***or had a reduction in pay*** or self-employment income, or had a job offer rescinded or start date for a job delayed. You may pay the income tax on this distribution evenly over a 3-year period and there's no 10% early withdrawal penalty. You can repay this distribution if you want, and you have 3 years to do it.

I have not contracted COVID but there was a company wide reduction in salary starting from July through the end of October. Based on the above:

* Would I be eligible for withdrawing via the CARES Act?
* **My salary reduction ends in October at the end of the month. Would I have to make this claim now before that or any time during this year?**
* What evidence do I need to provide to the IRS regarding the reduced pay? How will they determine that this is a tax exempt withdrawal? Apparently, the tax form provided with the withdrawal, 1099r, does not specify that this is a CARES Act Distribution.

\*\*Two and this is some rambling of my own:\*\* One of my friends is a single child to his parents. He is in his 40s and his parents are in their 70s. He too has no intention or marrying or having and this topic just came up during the discussion as to what happens to his money after this death. 

I by default always planned that it would go to my sibling and never gave much thought to the same but now when I put myself in his position, it makes me look at my own money in a different way. 

My only concern up until now was that after my death my money shouldn't just lie vacant till the government or bank seizes it up. So as long as I put everything on my brother's name, it's all cool and that is where the thought process ended for me. 

But now when I question myself what is the purpose of these assets and corpus for myself, I'm realizing that I'd seriously cut down on my money making efforts if I was the last in line. That I'd live differently and focus more on experiencing life and improving my NOW than building assets. I feel like these are some things I never questioned before. I am a bit blank right now.

I just turned 27 and I work in tech at a company that has a pretty decent outlook, I'm imagining this role will be around for a while, and if anything my salary should increase if I continue to work hard.   
My net worth is about \~90k. As I'm reading up on here and in general, I'm finding that it's increasingly hard to justify moving out of my parents house. My current expenses are around \~800-900 a month. 500 goes to my parents for groceries, I buy beer pretty regularly, clothing &amp; fitness gear every so often and eat out maybe 3-4 times a week. 

So after all my expenses are said and done, I'm pulling in around 59k a year that's going either straight into my Roth, my 401k or my brokerage account. If I move out into my own place, that number optimistically goes down to 35-37k per year saved.. If I stayed here for 3 years compared to if I didn't, that's around 60k in profit I'm losing simply due to rent and utilities, which, if you factor in compound interest over the course of 20 years or so, assuming a 7% rate of return, is projected to be a total opportunity cost of 230k, over 30 years, that's 456k. 

I realize I'm at a comfortable salary and at the end of the day, I'd probably be fine for retirement even if I moved out, but I'm wondering what more experienced members of this community think? 

With COVID, I'm greatly restricted to what I can do socially, I can't really go out to bars / restaurants and hang out with as many people my age as I'd like, and of course that comes with a big opportunity cost in itself, so I'm a bit torn. I'd hate to watch my social life decay and wonder what could have been by just living with my parents, not to mention, I definitely will need to get laid soon and living with my parents for sure does not help with that (unless I meet a chill, FIRE minded girl whose down with the cause haha). At the same time though, when I look at the numbers, I can't help but feel like I'm throwing away potentially millions in the future for just adhering to this one simple principle of minimizing expenses.

BEANSTOX - just downloaded this one because I like Kevin O’leary hahaha havent used it at all yet though any thoughts on it out there?

COINBASE - Threw $50 (5x$10) into 5 different cryptos “just incase” a big spike happens one day

CHASE - not for investing but checkings account funds all other accounts/apps

M1 FINANCE - my personal favorite; most of my individual stocks held here; I currently own 24 with percentages ranging from 3-14, theres about $500 in this account I have been adding in $100 every week

ROBINHOOD - my oldest account and how I got started; theres about $1000 in here I guess this has turned jnto my “play money” where I usually purchase a new stock for the first time or if I plan to try make a day trade I do it in here (aware of the day trade limits in this app); have been slowly taking money out of this one to move into M1

TD AMERITRADE - opened specifically to buy MMEDF

VANGUARD - where I have my Roth IRA, only just opened it last year so right now its sitting at ~8k; I keep my long term minded stocks here such as SPY (chose this over VOO to avoid fees what do you guys think of that move), some steel stocks, HEAR until new xbox comes out, TSLA, etc


This is my during COVID set up meaning thw amount I put into all of these has decreased because I’ve been holding onto cash a bit more mostly because of uncertainty but also because I dont have anything I feel strongly about or that I feel deserves a lot of investment at the moment.

Another thing I’d like opinions about are REITS - my portfolio right now is basically 95% stocks and I wanted to diversify and branch into real estate - are REITS a good way to do this?

Here's my story:  


I was one of five children living with my mom who never graduated from high school. She was a waitress, worked in a store, did odd jobs. I was the youngest kid, and I remember being 12 years old when I got my first pair of shoes that were my very own new shoes, not hand me downs. I remember being arrested for shoplifting when I was 10, and how my mom broke down when she found out I had been stealing school supplies. She wanted us all to go to college. Most of us did. When I was in college on a scholarship, she finally graduated from high school by studying for and passing her GED. She got a job at the county as a clerk, which was the first stable job she ever had.

Two years after I got my Ph.D., I had a brand new townhouse built for her. She got to pick out the granite for the countertops and the fixtures for the bathrooms and the wall color.

When I sold that place later, I lost money, but honestly, fuck money when it comes down to it. It was the nicest place she ever lived in.",financialindependence,"People from low-income families who are pursing FI, what's your story?",0

I don't talk about my finances with folks IRL so oftentimes I feel like I am just winging it alone and hoping for the best. While I don't necessarily think the internet is the spot to get all my financial advice, this is a small attempt to get outside my own head for feedback, support, and constructive criticism. With that being said, lets start this FIRE journey!

&amp;#x200B;

**Backstory**

I was born in (and live in) the US, and was fortunate to grow up in a home where we lived well within our means. I learned great savings and money management principals from my father, and was able to go to high school and college with scholarship + family money. This allowed me to work part time (I had a number of successful internships, and personal businesses) and put all of my own money towards personal expenses (cars, computers, etc.), travel/luxuries, and most importantly savings. Fast forward to 2019 and I am able to graduate with a well paying job, no debt, and a small pile of cash. Now that I am looking more seriously at the reason I am saving money, I figured I need to have actual goals and processes in place rather than just stowing away what ""feels right."" FIRE seems like a great goal to have, and even if life changes along the way I won't regret being closer to that security.

I will break down my budget later and there may be a line item that a lot of people don't have -- especially given the time value of money. As a Christian I believe in generous giving &amp; tithing so you will see a significant portion of income dedicated to that end. While I must admit that at times I even find myself thinking ""what if for just this month I allocated that elsewhere...."" this is something that is a part of my life and always will be. It comes off the top out of joy.

&amp;#x200B;

**Timeline of Net Worth**

Jan 1, 2019: **32k** \- Savings over the years up to my last semester of college

May 1, 2019: **45k** \- A good semester of contract work &amp; graduation gifts

June 1, 2019: **43k** \- A little dip in equities, started working with 80k salary (and opened 401k)

Jan 1, 2020: **78k** \- Enjoying the bull market, retirement matching, and raise to 105k

Today: **129k** \- More saving, saving, saving

&amp;#x200B;

**Allocations**

Brokerage: **51k** \- Equity investments. Keeps me up at night sometimes.

RoboBroker: **17k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

RothIRA: **19k** \- Equity investments same as Brokerage. Higher risk with long timeline &amp; tax benefits.

RoboRoth: **12k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

Roth401k: **20k** \- Roboinvesting in ETFs

Emergency: **10k** \- Roboinvesting with super low risk tolerance (2-3 / 10)

&amp;#x200B;

**Monthly** **Budget**

Taxes: **29%** \- ouch

Giving: **12%**  \- see backstory

Rent: **12%** \- expensive location with multiple roommates

Living: **6%** \- food, gas, gym, etc.

Discretionary: **6%** \- hobbies, travel, etc.

Roth401k: **7%** \- company match 4% - I just moved this up to 14% after building my emergency savings and expecting to lose part of my RothIRA eligibility soon.

RothIRA: **6%** \- Always maxed, however I expect to have to reverse after EoY bonuses.

General Savings: **22%** \- minimum 2k/mo, any leftovers from living &amp; discretionary go here.

&amp;#x200B;

**Kindling the Flames**

It is likely that there is an EoY bonus around the corner but I have no clue what sized -- I would conservatively guess 10k and optimistically guess 20k. I am known to be a bad guesser though and am not going to scoff at 5k either. Hopefully I can skirt by without having to reverse any of my RothIRA contribs but I think at least a portion of these will have to get touched. My plan is to dump this straight to savings.

Having now learned about FIRE concepts I decided that I want to start putting my time, energy, and finances towards this goal. I am not going to be a masochist about it, and absolutely want to maintain a quality of life, but I also want to find better ways to utilize my income to support this. The goal for me isn't retirement for retirement sake, but rather to get to a position where I could take passion jobs without worrying about the income, go take time to serve in other communities/countries, dedicate my time and energy to family or other causes, etc.

I think there is plenty of room for growth and improvement in how I am operating things so I am open to any and all feedback, thoughts, speculations. I know I may have to swallow some pride in the name of wiser investment choices. If anything this may serve as a fun story for myself to look back on as it develops.",financialindependence,Starting With Embers at 23,0

It is really a great tool as it allows you to put in nearly all of your financial data (portfolio balances and composition, when to start retirement and how long, income needed, pensions, SS, future contributions and windfalls, etc.) and figure out historically if your situation would be successful based on all of the starting years for which they have data.

In my situation, my retirement will be funded by a combination of 401k/457b, pensions, SS, and a windfall I expect when selling my house before moving abroad. I am toying with the idea of retiring in 3 1/2 years at age 55 so I wanted to see what income I could generate.

Without boring you with the details I looked at the differences in withholding my pension from age 55 to 63 (thereby increasing it from less than $13k to more than $26k) and withholding SS from age 62 to 70 (thereby increasing it from less than $25k to more than $43k). Much to my surprise holding out those 8 years to nearly double my income resulted in a less successful retirement by every metric that firecalc shows. I ran the scenarios with a starting income of $84k running to age 90 with CPI increases to see how it worked out. The results show the early payouts (55 and 62) vs waiting (63 and 70):

Odds of success: 92.7% vs 85.4%

Average money left at the end: $8.2M vs $7.3M

High money left at end: $19.3M vs $19.2M

Low money left at end: $-1.9M vs $-3.9M

Worst case minimum number of years before being broke: 22 vs 14

I also figured out what the maximum amount of money to spend each year at historical 100% success and the early pensions/SS won there as well at $78k vs $72k.

The only situation where the late payments works out better is if I hit the worst case scenario and exhaust all of my 401k/457b. The worst historical year would put me at 14 years (age 69) so I could still end up with my pension (more than $26k, only slightly inflation adjusted) and SS at $43k (or about $40k if I had to start at age 69). I would also have another pension that would also pay out about $13k (not inflation adjusted) leaving me with about $79k decreasing effective value annually as my pensions won't keep up with inflation. Whereas if I took the more historically effective route of early payout from my pension and SS, and I still crapped out 22 years later at age 77, I would only have less than $25k (SS) + $13k (pension 1) + $13k (pension 2) = less than $51k, also losing value from inflation. It would be a lot tougher to live on that $51k than $79k if the need arose, although like I said there has never been a scenario where the early withdrawal plan didn't succeed in giving me $78k (inflation adjusted).",financialindependence,Firecalc observation on taking pension and SS early vs late,0

I took at $58K per year job and started paying off these loans immediately. 1K per month. The rest of my $ went towards partying.

In 2016, I lost my job due to a company buyout and took another job making $68.5K per year. 

I started contributing very small to my 401K then. I worked my way up through the company and by fall of 2018, I was making $100K and was a manager at age 25. 

I was so burnt out and took a job back at the company that bought my company out for $120K in Jan 2019.

At that point my net worth was $3,900.

I bought a house, sold a house, won money in crypto and invested heavily in my 401K and weedstocks. I also finally finished paying all my student loans in June of this year. 

Today I am sitting at the following asset allocation:

401K - $79K (100% in PLGIX large cap growth fund)

Indv. Brokerage accounts - $52K (70% of this is in US MJ and the rest in tech stock plays) 

Crypto - $4K 

Savings - $11K 

I am extremely heavy in equity MJ and tech. And I will stay this way. My estimates are that I will pass a million dollars at age 36-37 and at this point I will retire and become a math teacher. Assuming the market returns 6-10% on average over the next 10 years. These estimates are based on no salary increases. If there’s a long bear market, that will just delay my career change but it’s not the end of the world.

I can’t find it anymore, but I recall that the general consensus was that since we can’t predict how the stock market will perform, there isn’t much to discuss, and those on the FI path would be better served spending that time on things they can control like increasing their income and decreasing spending. While I do agree that the market is out of any one person’s control, I think it *is* prudent to spend a considerable amount of time optimizing our portfolios given that a good chunk of FI/RE is usually achieved by means of investments. 

It seems to me that the argument for a globally diversified portfolio is that there are times when the US outperforms the world and times when the world outperforms the US, and that there are too many unknowns to make an accurate prediction, so it is best to just buy a slice of everything. The underlying assumption is that there is an *equal chance* that any one group of stocks will outperform the rest, which is why we are supposed to buy a global market-weighted ETF like $VT. I think this idea is a bit flawed and unfair to historically well-performing subclasses of stocks.

Hypothetically speaking, let’s say that the NASDAQ-100 ($QQQ) has a 50/50 chance of having a repeat of the last decade (19.04%) or go to zero dollars, with nothing in between, vs. a 100% chance that $VT will repeat its last 10 years in performance (8.06%). Assuming you have the risk tolerance to accommodate both, which would you choose?

A $10,000 in $QQQ in November of 2010 would have yielded $57,137 by the end of October 2020 and $21,713 for $VT. $QQQ returned over **4x** as much in nominal dollar returns. So, the expected value of our hypothetical is:

$QQQ: (0.5* $47,137 + 0.5* -$10,000) = $18,569.

$VT: (1.0 * $11,713) = $11,713. 

As you can see, the expected value of $QQQ is STILL vastly higher even when considering a 50% chance of the NASDAQ-100 going to zero in ten years time. Not just 0% returns, but actually declining all the way down to zero. In fact, in this two outcome experiment, you would only need a 38% chance of a repeat on the $QQQ and a **62%** chance of going to zero to trump a *guaranteed* 8.06% return on $VT from a purely mathematical perspective.

This wouldn’t be an issue if all indexes both in the US and around the world returned roughly the same amount, but they don’t, there is a large gap between well-performing American indexes like the NASDAQ-100 and the global average that only seems to be getting bigger as larger returns compound over time. 

There is a large opportunity cost that comes with safety in being well-diversified that many I feel are not fully taking into consideration. Yes, past results doesn’t guarantee future returns, yes, you can’t predict the stock market, but does that mean that I should simply default to a globally diversified portfolio? In my opinion, if your risk tolerance can accommodate both, it makes sense to take a calculated risk because the reward could be so great. 

In a more realistic example, suppose that I think there is a 25% chance that the NASDAQ returns 4% in the next 10 years (less than a quarter what is was in the decade prior), 50% chance of a 10% return and a 25% chance of a 15% return, again, well below the last 10 years. I would consider this to be a pessimistic outlook. Compare that to a 25% chance of $VT repeating 8% and a 75% chance of outperforming the last decade, a 10% return. 

$QQQ:  (0.25 * $4,802 + 0.5 * $15,937 + 0.25 + $30,456) = $16,783
$VT: (0.25 * $11,589 + 0.75 * $15,937) = $14,850


It’s still not even close. My point is that the NASDAQ-100 would have to fall *really* far to justify holding a globally-diversified ETF, and even a small chance of a repeat is enough to warrant taking that risk. I think it is important to do these calculations for your own portfolio rather than simply shutting off our brains and assuming that all outcomes have the same probability in light of past performance. Again, this *only* applies when your risk tolerance is not a factor.

I’ve saved up and looking to  invest about $200k into a taxable brokerage account (I’m a PAW). I’ve recently read The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins and decided that the VTSAX seems to be the play in putting my money over the next 40 years. I already max out my 401k sponsored through work and an IRA each year and those accounts are returning around 14.1% over the pay three years. So a tax efficient account is not an option for this lump sum in particular.

As I begin to research, I’ve noticed that ETFs may be a better play for taxable accounts where someone plans to hold for a very long time. In this case, I am deciding between investing this into the VTSAX or the VTI. 

Is this the VTI the correct decision in my instance, or is their disadvantages of the VTI for a taxable account that I am blind to?

TLDR: I wanna transfer my savings to a Roth IRA while my financially savvy dad insists that I should stick with the Traditional IRA. Who's right?

I (20F) am studying CS in school and have completed an internship at a FAANG company this past summer. I used a lot of my earnings to pay for school, and ended up saving about $1,500 in the 401k account the company provides thinking that I could take advantage of company matching. I came to realize the matching doesn't apply to interns, and that I didn't save enough for the company to keep the account open, so they rolled over that amount into a Traditional IRA after my internship was complete.

I have been thinking that I should take the money out of the Traditional IRA, pay taxes on it, and put it in a Roth, hoping to only contribute to this Roth during my junior and senior year as well, and switch to a Traditional IRA once I'm out in the industry. My reasoning behind this is that I am in a far lower tax bracket now than I will be after graduation, and likely at retirement (though I don't know when that will be). I made roughly $22k this summer, gross, and expect to be pulling at least 6-figures post graduation at one of these FAANGs. Thus, it makes sense for me to want to pay taxes upfront because I will have to pay fewer taxes now percentage-wise than at any other point in my life.

When I told my dad, who taught me a lot of stuff about finances in the first place, he rolled his eyes and told me I was overthinking it. His main argument was that you should always opt to pay taxes later as opposed to now because I don't know anything about what options will be available to me in the future. Mainly, he was speaking to the fact that the tax code could be different, or that my assumption that I'll be in a high tax bracket at retirement may not be so valid at that point if I'm living off of capital gains, for instance. I dunno about this, I kind of love working, so I can't imagine not having some income at the time of retirement, though this is 20 year old me speaking on the topic.

After I thought about it further, I also realized that the taxes will decrease my principal, and the whole point of saving for retirement early on is to take advantage of the power of compound interest. So, now I'm left wondering if the decreased principle now will counteract the effects of increased taxes later. Whatever my decision will be, I'll probably contribute roughly the same $1,500-2,000 to that account for the next couple summers when I'm in school. 

I know that the sum of money really isn't that significant, I'm treating this decision as more of an intellectual exercise and an opportunity to learn more about tax policy. I'd love to hear your take on this debate because I've been a silent lurker on here for years since my parents instilled in me that money gives you the freedom of choice, something that has always been appealing to me.",financialindependence,help settle dispute: roth vs traditional ira in niche case,0

Thinking back on previous Christmases where I knew people fighting with their family and friends wanting money they made, I remembered a [comment I read in this sub about how to deal with that](https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/jfpl1o/being_stealth_when_people_know_your_job_titles) that I've also done as well:

&gt; My mom would offer to help anyone in the family by offering a financial advice and if they would give her complete and full control over their finances, she would guarantee that she could help them save more money to afford the things that they want. Problem is, once she starts saying that you can't afford this and that and this and that, they all of a sudden don't need her financial help anymore and can figure it out on their own. They've also stopped asking for money from my parents since the ""help"" offered is tightening their budget instead of hers.

This is because just giving people money doesn't really help them understand how that money was gotten and why it's being given. You hear a lot of parables about this, like teaching someone to fish than giving hem fish. This is due to [Economic Outpatient Care mentioned in the book Millionaire Next Door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Millionaire_Next_Door#Economic_Outpatient_Care):

&gt; Economic Outpatient Care (EOC) is a term used to express when an affluent parent provides money to an adult child. Besides offspring observations resulting in Under Achievers of Wealth (UAW) children, EOC is a contributing factor to the passing on of the UAW belief. **Offspring who receive EOC have 98% of the annual income compared to their counterparts who are not recipients of EOC. In comparison, they also have 57% of the net worth.** EOC gives recipients a false sense of financial security. For this reason they purchase homes in upscale neighborhoods that exceed the recommended value according to their incomes. Thirty percent of American families live in homes valued at $300,000, yet only earn an annual income of $60,000.These homes then demand nice cars for the driveway, nice furniture for the living room, and a nice plasma TV to complement the furniture. These offspring also purchase and consume the EOC rather than invest it. If a dose of EOC is given on a regular basis, the EOC can actually be absorbed into the individual’s perceived annual income. Expenditures are then calculated with the anticipation of a regularly scheduled dose of EOC.

In other words, giving money to people makes them less likely to try on their own. It just feels better in the short term but hurts them in the long term. I used to give out money initially but I curbed that and only started giving advice from then on.

A note about advice though, you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink. People don't really want to tighten their own living situation and make sacrifices, as you see in the /r/financialindependence thread above, they just want your money for free. I've told many people about basic financial advice and they just don't want to implement it. I tried to convince them in the beginning but now I just say, suit yourself. If I'm rich in a decade and you just spent it all on stuff, I'm honestly not sure what to tell you. I suppose in rare situations you can give money, but in my experience it never ended well.",financialindependence,"I don't give people money anymore, now I only give advice",0

She missed out on graduation HS, college and being successful in my career. I was always told that I wasn’t going to mount to anything. (I think that pushed me even further) and also one big reason why I stopped talking to my mother.

I have a job offer that starts in the June '21.

    Employer matches up to 3% for 401/Roth

The job requires me to move a couple states away. 

I'm anticipating ~57k after Federal/State taxes. Haven't calculated the insurances/health yet. Assuming ~1500/mo for rent+util, that brings my 57k down to 39k. I was planning on maxing out 401 (19.5k) which brings me down to 19.5k left over for normal expenditure, savings and hopefully some other investments. I expect this to be a lot lower due to the health insurance stuff i need to look at (i don't have access yet so i don't know costs)

I made a purchase for a personal item that cost me ~$500. I never make purchases that big for myself and for the past week have ruined half my vacation and missed out on some good bonding time with family because I was literally in complete anxiety/shock as to whether I should return the item, sell it, etc. I spent 30+ hours from the time from waking up to the time sleeping thinking of scenarios in how I could make back the money for this, what my return is in happiness/efficiency, how much it affects my net worth, target retirement, etc. I would wake up in the middle of the night and it would be the first thing on my mind. At some points I felt like vomiting. 

I finally made the decision to keep the item (could always sell it with little loss) but it made me realize how much I'm killing myself with this over analysis. I'm blessed to make six figures, have NW in the ~$250k in my 20s, but at some point I think I've realized I'm not spending $500 each month. I hit all my target savings goal + made some extra income this year. This isn't the first time I've done something like this year, I spent about 10 hours analyzing items that I did really need but cost a lot of time to the point where my boss questioned if I'm okay - so it's affecting my job.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Does it make sense to add her to the 401k plan of my company as a spouse and try and max her out by giving her a larger salary? Is the added cost in FICA offset enough by benefit of putting 50k+ in a spousal 401k?
2. With my 2 small children (ages are 2 and 5), is there anything I can do with them? I was thinking of doing a 529 and trying to fund as much as possible now so I don't have to worry in the future and if they don't use all of it, I can always roll it over to possible future grandchildren or even myself and my wife if we decide to go back to school during retirement for any reason. What are the pitfalls of doing so?
3. Is having a trust of some sort worthwhile for my children? I assume I should get a living trust to avoid probate, but was not sure about any other kind of trust planning.
4. If I am doing the max 401k contributions, can I do any other backdoor IRAs?

I’m posting it as others may find it informative. 

I have bought and renovated 3 properties over the last 6 years. Stepping up the property ladder each time. This is something I’ve done separately to work and alongside an unrelated full time job. 

I’ve never bought a house with the sole purpose of making money. I bought houses that I saw myself living in for the foreseeable future, and also had the potential to add value to. 

One major perk with this route is that, as I don’t approach this for the purpose of making profit, and it’s my primary residence, any gains are tax free. 

I’ve been lucky at several points along the way, and fully acknowledge that this was done in a rising market.  

I have a decent level of manual dexterity. And can perform many of the trades. But I have also relied significantly on tradesmen. Just being able to plan and do manual grunt often saves significant money. For example... when doing a bathroom I will likely rip out the bathroom myself, buy all materials and the suite. Pay someone to plaster. Do some first fix stuff and plumbing, maybe fix some of the suite in place. Get a plumber to do some harder bits. Get a tiler in (I can tile but often professionals are faster and better - this is true for many trades). If I need electrics get an electrician in (I never touch electrics). Do some finishing off, 2nd fix and decorating. This often totals a lot less than handing over the whole
job to one company. 

1st property: 
A 2 bed flat. I didn’t want a flat but couldn’t afford a house where I wanted to live. At the time they were doing 95%mortgages. Bought for around 132k. It was in decent condition (old lady had had it from new). Did a light refurb inc  new bathroom. Probably spent about 6k. Sold it for around 147k. I rented it back from the guy who bought it whilst I looked for the next place. 

2nd property: 
Now my partner got involved so this increased our affordability. Although she cried a lot at the prospect of taking on the project (more on that later). 3 bed detached. A real mess. For example the cat had used the bathroom floor for a litter tray for 10years. I had to cut that out back to the joists as the floor was literally rotten with cat piss. Got this on a 90% mortgage. Bought for 222k. Spent about 17k. Sold it for 313k. The beauty here was that it was a comparatively young house so major jobs like windows and electrics were mainly sound. We sold it and moved to rented whilst looking. 

3rd property: 
4 bed detached. The size of the property went up a bit. But being a slightly older property the costs went up loads. This was also a real mess. I forget our LTV when we bought this one. But we paid 425k. We spent 18k before you could even tell we’d touched the house. Things like 2k on a fence, 1k on cutting trees, 3k on electrics, 3k on boiler and plumbing, etc etc. It adds up fast. Total we spent about 70k and current value is 540k. 

Other points: 
We’ve lived in these properties whilst doing them, which means many months without carpets, washing up in the bath, no kitchen, etc 
My gf had never done anything like this previously and now loves it. She’s desperate for the next Challenge but we can’t find anything that tickles our fancy. 
The last 2 properties weren’t from common routes like Rightmove. We walked the streets, flyered areas, asked anyone we spoke to, and got lucky. 
We only got the last 2 places because we were in rented and able to moved flexibly, chain free.

All my debt, except student loans, is paid off. I have 3-4 months of expenses saved in an emergency fund. I’m saving money for a new car and for repairs on my current car. After the holidays, I am going to look into how to start maxing out my retirement at work. 

Aside from that, I need some surgery next year that my insurance doesn’t cover. It will cost about 7k. I’m wondering if I should save up for the surgery first and pay for it entirely in cash or if I should pay the down payment (around $1500), put the rest on Care Credit (no interest for 12-18 months) and then I can pay it off while also continuing to save. 

I see benefits to both strategies. I could divert all the money I save each month to save for the surgery and then just pay for it in cash and go back to my normal savings. 

Or if I pay the down payment and put the rest on the Care Credit, then I could continue working towards my savings goals while paying the surgery off. There’s no interest on the Care Credit or I wouldn’t even be considering it. But the money I continue to contribute to my savings would be earning interest.

One of the key recurring themes in FI is around expense cutting. FI-enthusiasts float a lot of great ideas around cutting expenses to the bone. I have implemented a lot of these ideas myself, but there is one popular expense item that I won’t compromise on, and that’s cell phone service.

I use Verizon. They are the most premium brand and I know I can save money by switching to various other low cost providers. However, the reason I will not is simply due to security.

As SIM swap scams become more prevalent, it’s important you take the necessary precautions to protect yourself. However, there are only so many precautions you can take as an individual. There comes a point that you need to trust that your cell phone provider is doing the right thing. Do you trust your low cost cell provider to take the necessary precautions on their end to protect you from a SIM swap scam?

Many of the low cost providers operate on very thin margins. It’s no secret that Verizon is a very profitable carrier. This allows them to provide a higher level of service to their customers. I strongly believe that they take SIM security far more seriously than other providers. For example, they recently introduced a new feature earlier this year called “Number Lock” which adds an extra layer of security to SIM swapping than what existed previously. Basically, if a thief speaks to an associate pretending to be you and passes the normal security check, the associate still won’t be allowed to process a SIM swap if you enabled Number Lock.

Cell phones are much more than just about being able to make calls and surf the web. They are tied to our financial accounts and thus are an important part of our lives. When deciding on a cell provider, security should be of top concern.",financialindependence,You shouldn’t skimp on cell phone service,0

I've studied a ton of different material online on this topic. Funny enough, there is no knowledge at all for an investor! Sometimes I also come across some trader's thoughts. The authors of these thoughts typically pretended to be engaged in psychoanalysis, however in fact they described the basics of financial discipline: assess the risk, follow your plan and blah-blah-blah.

I was pretty good at navigating within businesses and investing, but I felt like a three-year-old child when I was confronted with human relationships. Such illiteracy hurt me several times. So eventually I had to dive deep into the subject.

After my friend gave me advice, I went to see a gestalt therapist. At first I worked with him on personal issues - I will not talk about them. Then I understood that I could also analyze my financial situation.

I live in Russia. Most of the local investors were born in the Soviet Union. Since we were children we had dangerous views on life drummed into our heads:

* Our own apartments are better than renting.
* A car, an apartment, and a summer house are synonymous with wealth.
* Gold is the best asset.
* A man should build a house.
* Did you get divorced? Leave all your possessions to your wife.
* You have to provide a home for your kids.

At first I got these nonsense out of my head. Then I started discussing specific cases with the therapist. For example:

My ex-wife asked me for money for a horse riding lesson for our child. I refused to give her the money. She called me a bad father in response. But I really do care about my kids. How can I not feel angry?

A friend asked me for a loan. I said no. How can I not feel embarrassed?

And so on.

In rare cases, self-analysis helps me. With this tool I managed to get rid of dangerous investor feelings: patriotism, faith, greed, ego, etc.

Do you discuss financial issues with him?

since it's late on a relaxed Christmas evening I figured I might as well write about something that for me at least is a big part of the whole FIRE idea: Using my time to help people. 

For me this year has been strangely, weirdly productive and successful and now towards the end I'm coming into some money, plus I had the full year with at least three hours more per day thanks to working from home. 

So from the very first day on I wanted to use my time, effort and resources to be somewhat helpful, especially in a pandemic where many have it much worse. 

So I looked at what was out there that might need the help of an overworked and underentertained programmer. I started calling up places that deliver food to homeless and poor people around here, all but certain that they could use all the help they could get to deliver food now that nobody could come into their ""shops"". I called, they said they didn't need any help. 

So I hit up grocery stores, figuring they might be seeing a lot more use of their delivery programs. 

After that I called up our local health-system-thing and asked if they needed help tracking cases or something like that because I had seen it on the US news and there were plenty of TV reports saying that they were completely going under all across Germany. No, they were fine, no help needed. 

Luckily some of my coworkers needed help moving and renovating when the lockdown was lifted a bit so I could throw myself into those projects - but it is surprisingly hard to get someone to accept help there as well. If it's women they automatically suspect darker motives, if it's guys there is always this weird competition thing going on where working hard ends up more of an insult than actual help. It takes two or three times before help is accepted for help's sake. I'm not saying it isn't fun, just weird. 

Farms didn't need farmhands to replace the Eastern bloc workers that usually help with the harvest, most ""support network"" places were shut down completely, I couldn't even find anyone that needed help with cutting firewood or needed handyman work to offset the overbooked professionals that had backlogs of weeks to even look at anything. 

The first time I could just work and be potentially helpful is when I started delivering pizza two nights a week, the great part about that place is that everyone there is coming in to work, make some money on the side and leave again. Nobody tries to climb the nonexisting hierarchy, conversations are interesting with everyone being from so vastly different careers and lifestyles. Even though the people ordering food are rarely poor I can at least tell myself that I'm doing something that helps the community - and it keeps my mind occupied while I'm out there so I can just unwind for a bit. 

This just as a perspective who like me thought that being financially free and independent would be a great opportunity to help others. It's certainly possible, but surprisingly hard work that nobody forced me to do.",financialindependence,It is surprisingly hard to help people,0

Both between my 401(k), my Roth IRA, and my recently opened taxable account(s). My main focus has been to put money into retirement accounts, and then figure out what to do with it later. I think that the time has come to start paying closer attention to asset allocation. This actually hit me earlier this year when a coworker of mine realized she has been in 100% equities in her 401(k), and she's about 1 year from retirement.

Currently planning to max my 401(k) starting next year. Right now I'm contributing about $15k/year. I also max out my Roth IRA every year. I had a large bonus this year that I wasn't really prepared for, and that's why I have taxable holdings without a current maxed 401(k).

401(k):

* \~67k in Vanguard Institutional 500 Index Trust (100%)

Roth IRA:

* 25k in VTSAX
* 1.7k in BLV
* 2.5k in VXUS
* 1.7k in VFFVX

Note - I have money in VFFVX for the extra $ I don't have to buy individual ETFs due to the ROTH cap, but I think next year I'll sell BLV and buy VBLAX, and then sell VXUS and buy VTIAX. 

Taxable Account:

* 6k in VFIAX
* 9k in VEXAX
* 8.5k in individual stock holdings

# Potential future allocations:

Employer doesn't offer a total stock market index, so I'm thinking of rebalancing my 401(k) to:

* 60% VG Institutional 500 Index Trust 
* 15% VG Institutional Extended Market Index Trust
* 25% VG Institutional Total International Stock Market Index Trust

Roth IRA:

* 75% VTSAX
* 25% VTIAX

2. Should I keep my taxable accounts in line with my tax-preferred accounts?
3. Should I even purchase bonds at my age? And if I do, would something like 5% even mean much in a total bond fund?

It's reasonable advice in general based on volatility alone between the two asset classes and the tactic's main purpose is to avoid selling stocks when they're depressed.

However, if we pay attention to the part about **expenses**, this advice seems less relevant since your expenses doesn't scale 1:1 as your NW increases.   Jeff Bezos for example wasn't waiting for his NW to increase whether or not to buy a bigger yacht or island.  

Back to us regular folks...

Assume you start your retirement with a portfolio of $6MM and the you've been advised to have 10% of your NW in bonds/cash.  If you expected to have a $10k/mo spend in retirement and have $600k in your favorite bond or cash equivalents, you can ride out any stock slump for 5 years. 

The standard mixture of bonds is typically higher than 10%.

Assuming you're satisfied with this duration for any type of equity market recovery, why would you crank up the percentage of bonds in your portfolio in retirement just because your portfolio's percentage warrants you have more than $600k in bonds?

First post here please let me know if there this doesn't belong here. I hope this doesn't feel like a brag. I'm really humbled by this wealth. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 34 years old. Grew up poor in ""3rd world country""^(1). Single^(2). I work in tech and have been a part of 3 IPOs in the past few years. I always got lucky with the company I choose to go next. The most recent IPO was the best pop so far. I've been working in tech for 10 years now. I don't want to say I'm a genius but my skills are in the top 1% and I get offers pretty easily. I'm a senior manager in my current company. 

&amp;#x200B;

My financial facts: 

* My annual salary is $260k + 30 bonus (not guaranteed) 
* Money in stocks $200k
* Saving $100k
* Equity in investment home $500k^(3)
* Just bought a house for $800k for myself $4k housing expense. Put down 10%.
* Bought a Tesla with a 2.8% loan! Oops! 
* Other expenses $3k-5k. I hate that I don't know how much I spend exactly 
* IPO RSU $1.2m post w2 tax (will be released post lock out next year). Has a huge capital gain so have to keep those RSUs even though it is risky to keep stocks of the company you work for 
* Granted RSU for the next 2-3 years: $3m. This is a potential income. 1. I might get actual fired from the job. 2. stonks might go down. 3. Taxes!

&amp;#x200B;

**My plan**

1. Keep the job at least until initial RSU grant is drained. 
2. liquidate my company RSUs. 
3. Put more money in stocks and bonds
4. Sell my investment property as some point^(4)
5. ??
6. Profit! 

**My question**

I'm a bit overwhelmed. As I said I grew up poor. So poor that I didn't have brand new shoes until I was 15! Now I open up Fidelity and Robinhood and see about $5m ""net worth"" I feel a lot of things. None of which is feeling like what I'm doing. 

I love the idea of being financially independent but I'm not stopping working any time soon. I love the corporate environment. It's the jungle and I love to fight to survive! 

&amp;#x200B;

Where should I begin? Do I need to plan differently than what I'm doing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Footnotes 

1. literally out of the WW2 so it is accurate when I say it.
2. Lost half of what I made in my adult life to a divorce two years ago
3. rent and mortgage is evening out
4. Hassle of renting a property is too much. I really don't have time for that.",financialindependence,How do I manage my sudden wealth?,0

I'd like to make spousal backdoor Roth IRA contributions for her. How to do this while avoiding the pro rata rule?

As I understand it, if my spouse rolls over her IRA into a 401k or Solo 401k, I should also be able to make spousal IRA contributions for her, and avoid taxes when converting those contributions to a Roth IRA.

The question is: what tactics can we use to roll over her IRA to a 401k to ""wipe the slate clean"" and avoid the pro rata rule when making backdoor Roth contributions?

Sure, she could get a ""corporate job"" with a traditional 401k and roll over into that. But we are not interested in doing that now (she is a SAHM for our three young kids).

Could she create a Solo 401k with minimal self-employment income (from surveys, eBay, etsy, whatever) and roll her IRA into that?

Has anyone actually gone to the effort of ""manufacturing"" self-employment income with the main motivating purpose being to open a Solo 401k?  If so, was it worth the effort for an additional 6k Roth contributions per year?

I'd like to gauge how everyone invests here and maybe get some tips on how to stick with an investing strategy without worrying about what others are doing. I can't help but to compare myself to my brother who has a significantly higher income but actively manages his portfolio of about 180 stocks while I tend to be more passive. He owns a business so outside of IRA's, he just has a large brokerage account, no 401k's. He's 38, married with 3 kids and hops on every high flyer out there. He recently just bought ABNB and SNOW and buys every meme stock like PLTR. He does around 10-15% on these high flyers but also has a ton of quality stocks like the AAPL MSFT etc having the largest portions of his portfolio still. I'd also like to say that I'm happy he's killing it because I got him into investing about 3 years ago and he thanks me all the time for it. 

I'm 35, wife is 34. The last 3-4 years or so we've had our 401k's maxed and have our IRA's maxed. We have a brokerage account and a 529 for our son who is 3.5 years old. Any extra cash we have I immediately invest into our brokerage in mostly top names. We're holding about 40k in cash and that will quickly go down when we fund 12k in our IRA's come January. We're in the process of refinancing from a 4.5% mortgage to a 2.5% 20 year mortgage that will shave off 3 years plus reduce our bills $100, saving us about 86k over the life of the loan. Sweet deal!  We have no other debt than our home. 

In many ways, I feel like we're kicking ass! Here's our current allocation with percentages that does not include our home. 

S&amp;P500 -                              40.2%

MID CAP ADMIRAL-           14%

CASH-                                   10.9%

INDIVIDUAL STOCKS -      10.5%

QQQ-                                    8.7%

SMALL CAP ADMIRAL-       6.8%                  

VGT-                                      4.4%

IHI-                                       2%

VHT-                                     1.7%

FTEC-                                   .8%

&amp;#x200B;

I would love to hear feedback of this allocation here to see if this makes sense or not or how you think it could be better. I feel we're pretty diversified but would like to keep getting heavier towards the Nasdaq and individual stocks in our brokerage account. 

So, the Tortoise and the Hare. My only comparison I have with a similar time frame of both my brother and I is in my IRA which is:

QQQ- 48.6%

VGT-  26.6%

VHT- 12.8%

IHI-  12%

I'm up 60% on this allocation while he's up about 78% in the same time frame. 18% is nothing to sneeze at and is a lot, but I know 3 years is probably not a long enough time frame to tell the story. I just get concerned when he tells me 'most of the high flyers work out.' I tell him he'll have to manage selling much more in the future. I say 'many of these companies have shit valuations.' He says that 'many of them will grow into their valuations.' I say this means 'they all have to execute 100% and don't account for competition which is inevitable' etc. Well, you get the idea. 

I'm not saying I'm right and he's wrong. I keep building on my individual stock portfolio but prefer quality with and extremely small amount of speculative. Like, I'd rather just shovel money in Apple then chase NIO while I see these stocks catapult to the moon and I just keep chugging along my steady monsters. I know the market has always been crazy but the flood of retail investors worries me a bit and I think will continue to change the dynamic. Hype is making people rich without regard to valuations, almost like valuations don't even matter anymore. I tend to be a bit more old school while he's chasing everything.

The argument is that the conventional rule of thumb as I understand it (i.e reducing equity:bond ratio with age) is not as an effective strategy compared to a ""bond tent"" (i.e. shift more into bonds before retirement as normal, but then quickly shift out of bonds again, to 80 or 100% equity, in retirement).

Has anyone come across this, or uses this themselves? I would love to know the community's opinion.

For some context, I am an 18 year old male living in the rough inner city. I am currently enrolled in college (community college) as a mathematics major and plan on transferring to a senior college after I graduate. College is going well. I finished this semester with a 4.0 and I recently retook my SAT's and scored in a pretty high percentile so that's that.

I come from immigrant parents who emphasized education but I could never seem to follow their advice. I was always a very intellectually curious student-- just not with school. However, I then realized the importance of a good education and thought I'd turn things around (Which I am currently doing. Or trying to).

After Community College, I hope to transfer to a well regarded school and put my best foot forward. I plan on double majoring in mathematics along with computer science with hopes of possibly being a software engineer or working in the finance realm incorporating advanced mathematics with computation and finance. (Sorry if this information is irrelevant. Not sure what to include/exclude).

However I'm not sure about the feasibility of this plan. It just seems so out of reach. Not relative to my skill per se but rather where I am in life. I mean there are 9 people living in our 3-bedroom apartment, gangs in the projects where I live on any given day, dudes smoking weed in the hallways, piss in the elevators -- it truly is abysmal. I've watched countless, I mean countless, classmates go astray and assimilate into gangs, drugs, pregnancy , etc. By pure luck I managed to stay away from all of that.

I think what draws me into the fields I mentioned is that they are highly quantitative and analytical and I am forced to try my hardest to excel. However, I am not sure how to go about anything really. I don't know anyone in any industry. My dad is a janitor and every uncle or cousin I know works a low skill labor job or has no college education. I fear that I will slowly but surely assimilate into that. I mean what makes me different?

It just seems like my environment is getting ahold of me and this is precisely what I've been trying to avoid all these years.

I'm really not sure what it is I need. Really, if anyone (preferably those with similar experiences or knowledgeable on the matter) could offer some input or advice, I would seriously appretiate it.

Also, sorry if this wasn't really cohesive. Pretty tired of writing from the semester.

I truly respect and appreciate the bright minds in this group and would appreciate your insights on my situation. 

35/F (me)
40/M (husband) 

- Current NW is about $3.5M, majority of which is managed by Ameriprise. Have an additional $600K in robinhood that my husband plays around with 

- My comp is $400k annually, my husbands is $300-$400k 

- His previous company recently IPO’d. He was able to sell 15% of his stock immediately for $1.2M, and the remainder is currently evaluated at $11M. He’ll be able to sell it in Feb.  Would be great if it stayed at $11M, it continues to go up every day, but we’ll be happy with even a couple million from it

- With that variable, and after taxes, we should be around $6M net worth as a worst case scenario ... hoping closer to $8M come feb 

THE QUESTION: 

- We have used Ameriprise for the past 3 years. It’s fine. They hit standard benchmarks and are fine.. but we don’t know what we don’t know. I’ve been told that I should look around at other options since we’ll be going from $3-4M to $6-8M+ in feb. 

- We spoke to both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Both seemed good. Similar fees (less than 1% .. .6-.8ish). Personable, knowledgeable, etc. 

We don’t have super complicated finances. One baby, we live very frugally/simply, aren’t super aggressive... just want comfortable futures where we have flexibility. So.... 

Morgan Stanley? Goldman Sachs? Ameriprise? 

I’ve had a couple folks advice just throwing it in vanguard and saving the $50k+ annual fee but I’d love to hear opinions as to whether the fee is worth it... MS and Goldman both made it sound like they’d consistently be working our money for us and finding ways to optimize (“you made yourself wealthy, it’s our job to keep you wealthy” is what they said).

I expect a negative reaction, and even some quotes of Warren Buffett saying not to invest with margin. But I'm adding this post because there are some inherent advantages of pursuing FIRE that I think could make a small dose of this strategy a way to accelerate time to FI. For someone with no debt, a high savings rate, and an existing balance in a taxable account that I don't intend to withdraw any time soon, I'm wondering about the financial risks this position would expose me to. 

Using round numbers here's an example:

\- Current account balance of $150,000 invested 100% between 4 individual stocks  
\- Margin allowance of +$125,000  
\- Invest $30,000 on margin in BRK.B indefinitely, no trading, no options, just buy and hold  
\- Total invested amount: $180,000  
\- Maintenance margin: $80,000 (MM is the amount of capital required in the account before needing to deposit more cash).

I understand this magnifies risk and increases downside in a down market. The goal would not be to take advantage of all of the leverage available, both to reduce risk of a margin call and increase the sleep at night factor.

**Upside:**  
\- Pretty simple, if BRK.B can grow more than 2.7% per year (2.5% interest plus $60/year for Gold membership), I come out ahead financially. This isn't a very high bar. 

**Risks:**  
\- BRK.B falling precipitously along with all other stocks in the portfolio. The holdings would need to collectively fall by 55% in order to go to a maintenance margin situation. This could happen due to systematic risk (e.g. recession) or unsystematic risk (Warren Buffett passing away). I think these risks are somewhat mitigated by the margin of safety Berkshire enjoys, $100b in cash, and commitment to buy back shares.  
\- Margin rate increasing at Robinhood. If the interest rate increases, the hurdle rate is higher.  
\- Emotional attachment. Investing borrowed money could increase stress without discipline, and that has it's own cost even if I come out ahead financially.  
\- Getting greedy if this works near term, overextending to use additional leverage, and then encountering large losses

Again I don't expect positive reviews but I want them to be a little more reasoned than ""DON'T DO IT!"" What am I missing here? Has anyone else pursuing FIRE done this? How is this different from, for instance, keeping $30,000 in your mortgage at 2.5% interest rate while having $30,000 invested in a stock?

When I was a teenager, I had a talk with my parents regarding finances.

In all seriousness, this really stuck with me. Ever since then, I’ve been incredibly frugal with my money. I’m 24, and a have a solid amount in savings (I think? With respect to other 24-year-olds… we can discuss this in the comments), and I’m actively planning for my future.

But then, comes the thought of having kids. I have NO idea if I even WANT kids. But, what if I do, maybe 10 years from now? Should I start accounting for my hypothetical kids, now?

Also, be honest with me: are the majority of y’all SINK/DINK? And/or working professional, white-collared jobs?

I inherited a house from my home country, which I don't live in anymore. I still go there a couple of times a year or so. At best I spend a month there per year, likely less in the future.

The house is worth around 130k. The house is useful because I always have a home when I go there with my GF. I have a couple rooms rented which are profitable (around 600€ a month), but it's a hassle to deal with as there is always problems to take care of.

I was thinking in the possibility of selling it and investing it in a world ETF instead. Assuming I get a 5% return, the 130k give me around 500€ a month. Whenever I visit my home country, I would rent an AirBnB instead, which costs me around 1000€ a month (and thus around that value a year).

So if I spend 1000€ a year for that AirBnB, I would still get a big chunck of money from the ETF. And when I eventually have kids, I won't be able to have 2 rented rooms anymore (I need 1 for the kids), so the rent profit from the house will be smaller.

I made the math for a 30 year period. Keeping the house and investing the rent would give me 449k, while investing it would bring 535k. 

I made the math with an excel sheet which can be seen here: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1snqxcWX41U1sgbNBeWyEcQUWdsLhJBLHKUAVF08AJ1I/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1snqxcWX41U1sgbNBeWyEcQUWdsLhJBLHKUAVF08AJ1I/edit?usp=sharing)

However this does not take into account:
1) The cost of keeping the house
2) The cost of AirBnB (I think mostly cancels the first)

I hope you will make a similar video or tweet if you feel the same way. 

I also wrote my reps to let them know how we can protect the free market. Feel free to reuse for your rep!

Dear Senator Warren,
I hope that you take this opportunity to level the playing field when it comes to the free market.
The definition of the free market is speculation. Every investment vehicle in the market explicitly states that you are at risk of losing value. We do not need further restrictions under the guise of “protection” as retail investors, we instead should be allowed to be on the same playing field. Day trading restrictions should be removed as it grants a distinct advantage to those that can take advantage of momentum swings. Trading certain stocks should never be restricted, regardless of portfolio size.
There instead needs to be more institutional regulation in place to prevent destabilization of the markets and to ensure that the market is truly free. Hedge funds should be required to be fully transparent to allow for better scrutiny to prevent market collapse which almost happened on Jan 28, 2021 when clearing houses lacked the liquidity to cover transactions and margin calls from the meteoric rise of Gamestop’s stock. This volatility was only possible due to the stock being shorted at a 128% rate. This mathematical impossibility will create an infinite short squeeze if the shareholders continue to hold without selling. Had another hedge fund made this contrarian move, it would have been hailed as a genius strategy and be commended. Because it was made by retail, it was instead punished by shutting down trading and allowing institutional transactions only, whose trading was able to drive down the price of this and many other stocks.
There has been immeasurable damage done to any shareholder of $BB, $AMC, $NOK, $GME, $BBBY and any other stocks that were prevented from being purchased during yesterday’s shutdown. This week’s ending option strikes are not true indicators of what the free market would have determined for this week as purchasing has continued to be restricted to miniscule positions.
To make it worse, there is collusion within the media and financial markets to ostracize retail investors and to protect the institutional actors from the consequences of their actions. There needs to be massive institutional changes that should be prioritized over a wealth tax.

This month, I earned a good review at work, and decided I could start to coast a bit more and try to focus more on my mental health. However, my boss had a different plan. Suddenly, I have more pressure than ever to deliver multiple projects yesterday, and am at a loss for how to respond.

How do you use your FU money in practice? In my experience, at least 50% of bosses want to push their employees to give their jobs 110%. I always imagined when I got to this point that I would be able to coast with a more comfortable 80%-90% effort, but it seems most bosses put pressure on their employees to be as productive as humanely possible by any means necessary. The pressure has really started to affect me and I have considered quitting, but since quitting would delay my FIRE date, I would prefer to keep my job with a slightly reduced workload. I also have some fairly specialized skills on our team, which has resulted in me being the only person on our team able to deliver certain projects. I thought this would be good leverage too, but I'm not sure my non-technical boss will truly appreciate this fact until I'm gone.

Hi everyone, I‘ve been a long-time lurker of the FIRE community here all through my years in school. The consistency and resolve I’ve seen from you guys have inspired me immensely. And now that I finally have my first full-time job, I would love to share my journey with you and document my path to FIRE.

Background: Spouse and I are aged 30 and 24. We live in a MCOL suburb of a VHCOL city on the East Coast. Recently got my MS in applied math. Spouse has an MS in a liberal arts field and works part time at a job they love. Our combined W2 income will be around 85k this year, projected to grow by a good amount as we progress in our respective fields.

Current Net Worth: $148k

Equity Breakdown:

$80k in primary residence that we purchased last year, after crunching numbers for a long time. Got a 20-year mortgage at around 3% which we‘re happy about.

$45k in cash, which is gradually being invested into a 3 fund portfolio in brokerage account. Target is keeping around $30k in cash (a lot, but last year scared me).

$13k in 2 Roth IRA’s, maxing this out since last year. All equity.

$10k in brokerage account. Equity/bond is about 75%/25%.

Some equity in car but I don't include it. I see it as more of an expense than an asset.

I just had my HSA and 401k set up at work, and plan to max out both. Currently both at 0 since I just got started.

Debt Breakdown:

About $320k left on mortgage. Spouse had small amounts in student loans which has been paid off.

Looking ahead:

I am very much an inexperienced young person who just got started on this journey. We plan to have 1-2 children in the next 10 years or so, which will definitely change our plans a lot. I can‘t tell for sure when retirement is at this point, but we project it to be in our late 40s/early 50s. Hopefully this will become more concrete as our salaries progress. I see us being able to cut back on housing costs after retirement, as we move farther away from big cities.

My biggest feeling towards FIRE right now is uncertainty in my future. It’s so hard for me to see where I will be financially, a long time from now. I know this kind of anxiety is normal for people my age, so I try to deal with it by staying the course.

Some things I’ve learnt so far on my FIRE journey:

Buying a house in a seller’s market: I went against some common suggestions last year and bought my first home in a red hot seller’s market. I only did this because we plan to hold onto this place for a really long horizon, renting it out if we move to another one. The rent is really high in the VHCOL city I work in, and even then the sqft is very small. After being stuck inside for most of last year, buying more room in the suburb was as much for our sanity, as it is an investment in our future. I see the house as doubling a savings account, and we can tap this via collecting rent once it’s paid off. 

Selection bias: It’s hard not to feel envious sometimes, when it looks like “everyone” is making it big lately through making big volatile investments. I remind myself that the Fomo would lead me to do stupid things, and I am way better off doing good old index investment like a get-rich-slow scheme. It’s not as thrilling to set your monthly deduction and forget about it, but it’s a much more guaranteed future. When I feel the itch for high risk high return investments, I put a higher percentage of my money into growth index funds, or less money into bond funds. Not as exhilarating, but also safer.

 I’d love to chat and hear any suggestions from you guys. I also plan to track my journey every year as I progress. Thank you all in advance! 🥰",financialindependence,The beginning of a middle-class FIRE journey — 2021,0

Is anyone else struggling every day with the desire to retire but you still have years remaining before you can?

I can’t take the stress of corporate life anymore, but since discovering fire one year ago, I realized I’m about three or four years away from being able to retire.

Now, all I do is run retirement calculators over and over tweaking knobs and dials. I check my portfolio every single day.  I agonize over different ways I could do things to retire even earlier. 

I am obsessed with reading financial news and the fire subreddits. 

All of this makes me more miserable at work and I don’t know how I can get through the next week let alone the next three years.

I was better off when I thought I had another 15 years to work because then I didn’t really think about it and time went faster.

I need to figure out a way to stop obsessing about this, enjoy the journey, and somehow be grateful for what I have and where I am. But I’m just not able to do that right now and I don’t know how.

I'd appreciate if the mods didn't remove it just because it's tangentially connected to another board. The behavior of the DTCC has the potential to effect **everyone** with money in the stock market, not just the WSB people gambling on meme stocks. If anyone wants to help figure this all out, it's appreciated.

I'm not a fan of Vlad, but this might not ultimately be his fault and if we are going to actually get this fixed, we need to go after the people who actually made the decisions that created this situation; The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation. The DTCC owns the DTC, Depository Trust Company, which is the primary platform trading occurs on. Over 95% of all stock, options and securities trades in the US are handled by the DTC.

The DTC issued a rule to clearing houses like citadel on Thursday that they needed 100% margin on $GME (and all the other short squeeze meme stocks) buy orders, as explained by the Webull CEO on Benzinga. Clearing houses each have 2 day ""clearing periods"" each week that vary from clearing house to clearing house. This means brokers which have been allowing trading on $GME will stop as soon as their clearing house is in it's clearing period, which will start on Monday or Tuesday for the brokers that have not halted buys yet. Brokerages are only able to trade $GME and the other limited stocks by essentially borrowing enough money from banks to match every dollar we spend on the stocks we like, which is how Robinhood was able to allow limited purchases until they apparently ran out of money. Again. RH could have allowed unlimited buys until they ran out of money, but that would have turned into a few people consuming all potential shares as soon as this information was public knowledge.

The explanation behind the rule from the DTC is to prevent a market failure where someone selling their share would not receive money for it, which could happen, but the DTCC, DTC's owners, are the ones allowing naked shorts in the first place through ""failure to deliver"" stock sales. They should carry the ultimate financial responsibility of allowing this situation to exist. The DTCC is desperately trying to cover up the fraud they've been facilitating for decades and the only reason we can see it now is because they are running out of options.

If the DTCC is forced to end the practice of failure to deliver stock sales, or put restrictions on it, the value of all securities with significant short interest could see massive spikes in value as the short positions are forced to close. If the DTCC is allowed to continue this practice, hedge funds will continue being able to drive otherwise stable companies into bankruptcy through market manipulation and financial restriction.

The only mistake Vlad made was trying not to look underfunded on national television, which also made it much harder to find out what was actually going on, and likely guaranteed that he will remain underfunded for the remainder of eternity even if he's lucky enough to avoid jail time.

We have a chance to recreate the entire financial system in the image of DFV but it won't happen if we waste our energy trying to get Vlad to pay for our tendie party from inside a prison cell. There's way to many moving pieces here for me to figure it out, I'm retarded, but someone here is probably less retarded, or at least, I'm willing bet 75% of my life savings on it. Like I said. I'm retarded.

If we don't get this sorted out by Monday, the shorts might pull something we don't see coming in addition to all the people who just moved to TD potentially being locked out again. Holding isn't enough, we need to fight the meta war.

- How should I make the most of the time off? (aside from doing all the stuff I want to do, of course)
- How should I keep a schedule and stay motivated?
- How do I avoid driving my girlfriend nuts with my newfound freedom?
- Should I plan on spending more money than usual?
- What should I know about getting back into the workforce afterward?
- What are pitfalls and gotchas to look out for?

I'm not a parent, so I don't have any dependents who rely on me.  I have a girlfriend, but she's self-sufficient.  As long as I'm coming up with my half of the rent she won't be impacted financially or anything.

I just want to do more and see more while I'm still young and healthy.  I know neither of those things are going to last forever.",financialindependence,"Hit me with some tips on how to take a successful sabbatical from work!

We file joint tax returns. The past couple of years, by maxing out my 403b contribution and my wife’s 401k contribution (19,500 each in 2020), we are able to lower our modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) to meet the Roth IRA income threshold (196,000 in 2020) which allows us to contribute the max to our Roth IRA accounts (6,000 each).

I work for a nonprofit company and just found out that employees also have the opportunity to participate in a Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan (457b) to supplement the Qualified 403b plan allowing up to an additional 19,500 of non-qualified employee pre-tax contributions.  Will my contributions to this plan also reduce our MAGI to continue to help meet the Roth IRA income threshold?  I’m asking because I want to switch a portion of my 403b contribution to a Roth 403b and make up for the additional pre-tax contributions through this account if it also effectively lowers our MAGI.

I'm thinking since the ""free"" trading platforms like Robinhood make money from lending securities to shorters, and we the retail investors swarming to these platforms. Does it mean there are more and more securities out there for shorter to borrow and at a cheaper and cheaper price?

According to this article, a single share of stock can be held and borrowed by multiple people at the same time and basically form a chain of shorters.

How can this chain not blow up at some point? Some shorter is going to go bankrupt, then the broker who lent them the securities might blow up.

I come to you with a question that I never expected to ask before this week.  I recently came into enough money to pay off the balance of my mortgage (and pay the tax man, of course). 

However, instead of paying the rest of the principal down, I want to maintain liquidity because it will give me peace of mind to know I can replace my roof or pay for major home repairs if needed.  My biggest concerns are rising interest rates in the near future (this is why I'm avoiding stock based index funds) and the currently high P/E ratio of equities in general.  I'm looking at Vanguard bond ETFs such as BSV (short term bonds) and VTIP (short term inflation-protected bonds).  

Do you have any other recommendations here?  My mortgage is at a 2.75% rate, I'm 27, and I have an additional $300k invested in equities (a majority of which is buried away in retirement accounts which is why I prefer keeping my money more accessible going forward).

The consistency and resolve I’ve seen from you guys have inspired me immensely. And now that I finally have my first full-time job, I would love to share my journey with you and document my path to FIRE.

Background: Spouse and I are aged 30 and 24. We live in a MCOL suburb of a VHCOL city on the East Coast. Recently got my MS in applied math. Spouse has an MS in a liberal arts field and works part time at a job they love. Our combined W2 income will be around 85k this year, projected to grow by a good amount as we progress in our respective fields.  


**Current Net Worth: $148k**

**Equity Breakdown:** 

$80k in primary residence that we purchased last year, after crunching numbers for a long time. Got an interest rate of around 3% which we‘re happy about. 

$45k in cash, which is gradually being invested into a 3 fund portfolio in brokerage account. Target is keeping around $30k in cash (a lot, but last year scared me).

$13k in 2 Roth IRA’s, maxing this out since last year. All equity.

$10k in brokerage account. Equity/bond is about 75%/25%.

Some equity in car but I don't include it. I see it as more of an expense than an asset.

I just had my HSA and 401k set up at work, and plan to contribute significant amounts to both. Currently both at 0 since I just got started. 401k is set up for a contribution of $1500 per month, HSA at around $300 (need to double check this number).  


**Debt Breakdown:**

$300k left on mortgage. Spouse had small amounts in student loans which has been paid off.

**Looking ahead:**

I am very much an inexperienced young person who just got started on this journey. We plan to have 1-2 children in the next 10 years or so, which will definitely change our plans a lot. I can‘t tell for sure when retirement is at this point, but we project it to be in our late 40s/early 50s. Hopefully this will become more concrete as our salaries progress. I see us being able to cut back on housing costs after retirement, as we move farther away from big cities.   


My biggest feeling towards FIRE right now is uncertainty in my future. It’s so hard for me to see where I will be financially, a long time from now. I know this kind of anxiety is normal for people my age, so I try to deal with it by staying the course. I don’t have a lot of great experiences or tips to share like you guys do at this point, but I’d love to chat and hear any suggestions from you guys. I also plan to track my journey every year as I progress. Thank you all in advance! 🥰",financialindependence,Beginning of our middle class FIRE journey - 2021,0

We were friendly with our neighbors for decades, until recently. One day, they introduced us to their financial adviser…

By Quentin Fottrell

&amp;#x200B;

**Dear Moneyist,**

My spouse and I have been friends with a neighboring couple for decades, until recently. In our early 30s, we worked, struggled, and endeavored to improve our lives. This included career changes, setbacks and successes, vacations and fun, work on our respective houses, and dinners out.

Our approaches to life were different but we remained fast friends nonetheless. For example, we took camping trips in the mountains, while they enjoyed trips to Europe.

In our early 40s, our friends invited us to meet with their financial adviser.

We dug trenches, poured concrete foundations, and worked to build our house; they hired contractors. They traded in cars frequently; we ran ours into the ground.

Our idea of a fun night out was the special at the local Chinese restaurant, while they clubbed it in the city. Indeed, their combined income was twice ours — probably more — and we had unemployment setbacks. But we never suffered relationship problems with the so-called wealth gap as so many friends do. While out for an evening together we split bills evenly, treated or were treated. It worked.

In our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser. We accepted and had a great time. Well, they did poke fun at us for participating too much on their dime. It was a good experience, and my spouse and I took it to heart and so did our friends, or so we thought.

After all, they talked about finances all the time, shared conversations they had with their financial adviser, and frequently forecast their future. Our friends had absolute plans to retire with their current lifestyle at 55, which at the time seemed out of reach for us, even if the underlying financial concepts seemed sound. We adopted the financial advice, mostly.

We stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, enjoyed our lives, and enjoyed one another’s company. In our mid fifties, finances came up again. They asked us about our plans, and we reminded them about the financial adviser meeting so many years back.

We stopped discussing finances for the next decade or so, and enjoyed our lives.

We shared that we had just finished our last five-year plan and, at 55, we were ready to retire with no debt, a steady income stream, full and nearly free lifetime medical insurance, and a healthy nest egg. This includes a nice capital gains exemption on our house sale.

We assumed they had outperformed us with their income but no, that same financial adviser is telling them that they need 10 more years of work to meet their retirement income goals. They have mortgage and credit-card debt and incomplete medical coverage.

They can’t down-size and sell their home at a profit, nor is their home configured to sell easily. The subject came up a few times more, but then they lost interest and we stopped discussing it. Now they have pulled away, and we haven’t spoken for a long time. We pass each other in town with polite nods or thousand-yard stares.

Maybe we can understand how they feel, but it is confusing. What happened?

Sincerely,

The Future is Bright, For Us

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Dear Bright,**

Your letter was compelling from the get-go. It exists in that bittersweet spot between friendship and hardship, romance and finance, saying too much and not enough, good neighbors and bad manners, and good manners and bad neighbors. When I read, “In our early 40s, our friends became interested in retiring early, and invited us to meet with their financial adviser,” I knew we had reached a turning point or a crossroads or — perhaps for your friends — something of a spaghetti junction.

It was an equal friendship in terms of dinner checks, but that doesn’t mean it was equal.— The Moneyist

They were living well, and they were also comfortable with you and your wife living, well, not quite in the same fashion. But you were A-OK with that. And you’re right. You can have just as much fun camping as you can have in Europe staying at a five-star hotel. More, in fact. Plus, you can enjoy a home that was lovingly renovated over time with the sweat from your own brow as much, if not more, than if you had hired contractors to turn it into a marble-encrusted suburban palace.

It was an equal friendship in terms of dinner checks, but that does not mean it was all equal. It may not have been a 50/50 relationship in the eyes of your friends. They wanted to help you when they believed that you needed their help, and whatever propensity they had for competing with others was not triggered in your company. It may be harsh to say they were at ease with perceiving you and your wife as the underdogs in this relationship, but it certainly seems that way.

If they did live beyond their means and live a lifestyle to which they hoped to become accustomed — and they can’t blame you or their financial adviser for their credit-card debt — it suggests that they may not be 100% happy in their own skin. When people are unhappy and they have a brief respite from those emotions when they buy a smart TV or a face cream that promises to make them look 10 years younger, it might not feel so bad to have friends who do not have access to those luxuries.

Pull up a chair because I am now going to tell you a story about a friendship.— The Moneyist

Look back without anger or diamond-encrusted rose-tinted spectacles. Was your friendship as real as you believe it to be? Pull up a chair. I’m now going to tell you a story. My father died 20 years ago and, after reading the death notice in the newspaper, my best friend from elementary school got in touch. In high school, he dropped me. I was crestfallen, but I also realized that it wasn’t healthy to have just one “best friend.” We had not seen each other since then, so I was curious to reconnect.

We arranged to meet for dinner in a restaurant in Dublin. When I arrived, he said, “Why don’t you sit down there — and relax.” Why was he telling me to relax? I was relaxed! Now I wasn’t feeling so relaxed! The evening started with that weird, condescending tone, and it went downhill from there. He asked a lot of questions, which soon took on a common theme. All roads led back to money, money, money: “Where do you live? How many bedrooms do you have?”

Late into the evening, and too many pints of Guinness later, he asked me in a slow, slurring drawl: “Do you mind me asking, ‘How much did you pay for your apartment?’” Again, I told him. He could do all the calculations he wanted to, but it was no skin off my nose. My friends have been, and always will be, the most valuable thing in my life. But at that moment it finally hit me: A childhood friendship I had encased in a special snow globe of my mind was, like this evening, actually difficult to endure.

Your frugal living led you to where you are today, retiring in your 50s.— The Moneyist

Memories came flooding back. Bad ones. Summer vacations when he didn’t return my calls. Reminders that he had more money, a recurring topic. Recalling those experiences led me to feel bad for my younger self. It wasn’t that he had changed, it was that he had not changed. He was the same. That high status/low status was the dynamic of our childhood friendship. I was so happy to have a friend back then that I put up with it. In 2001, however, one night was enough.

What did I learn from that? If someone is no longer in your life, it could be for a good reason. It’s OK to have a smaller home or less money than everyone else, so drive up to that school reunion bursting with pride in your old jalopy! Listen to how you feel, and take action. When you are spending time with neighbors or old school buddies who are not healthy for you, you are taking time away from yourself, and from days and nights spent with others. Time is infinitely more valuable than money.

They, and they alone, bear the sole responsibility for their own finances.— The Moneyist

Similarly, your friendship with these neighbors may not be exactly as you remember it. It is revealing that they poked fun at you for taking too much time with their financial adviser, or for asking too many questions. It shows that there was an invisible line not to cross. You could take a stock tip or two, but just enough so you would stay in your proverbial box. Have no doubt: Your investing and frugal living led you to where you are today, retiring in your 50s. No one is responsible for that, but you.

You never did ask your friends what went wrong. They may not give you an honest answer, but you may feel better by acknowledging that this friendship has come a cropper. They may be genuinely struggling financially and, while that must be hard for them to deal with, they — and they alone — bear the sole responsibility for that. Some people will only be around for the good times. Others will relish the bad times. But true friends will celebrate and commiserate, and be there for both.

If this friendship doesn’t recover, that’s OK. What was your part? Were you quietly competing with them too? Either way, I believe that we journey through people, and just because a friendship ends does not mean it was not a success for the time that it lasted. Sometimes, they simply run their course. Finally, every challenging experience we have and every person we meet is here to teach us something. And so what has this decades-long friendship taught you?",financialindependence,Interesting FIRE-related post from Marketwatch - The Moneyist,0

972,bantheguns,1611951955,self.financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/l836bi/stupid_selfinflicted_anguish/,14,False,1,"The past week has been one of the more unusual ones, at least from a financial perspective, in the past 12 months. This is a time period that has seen unprecedented market-wide crashes and booms, and yet nothing is quite like the chaos around Gamestop and r/wsb. As a longtime steadfast FIRE adherent, I have been surprised at how much **anguish** this past week has caused me. I am equally surprised at how I've managed to **self-inflict** this anguish. And most of all, I'm agog at how **stupid** it is that I'm in this situation, though my stupidity is of a different sort than the all-in-on-GME types will likely feel at some point in the near future. Given that this community has a healthy mix of both ""I never pick stocks"" types and ""I pick stocks with my fun money"" types, I'm curious to see just how many of either group are feeling the same sense of **stupid, self-inflicted anguish** this week.

Some background: My wife and I are both 33, have \~$750,000 split across various retirement and taxable investment accounts, and are allocated approximately 85/15 stocks/bonds. Neither of us has ever bought an individual stock, and saving comes naturally to both of us. I have been index investing since late 2013/early 2014, when I was several months out of school in my first job, looked at my checking account swelling to something like $18,000, and thinking ""hmmm...surely there is something better I can do with this money?"" I had a narrow escape with a financial advisor wanting to sell us whole life insurance, and got set on the path of self-directed index investing by the good people of SA's BFC subforum.

Ever since then, as I said above, I have never bought an individual stock (or bond, or crypto, or anything else). More to the point, I have never even had the *urge* to buy an individual security. Additionally, I have never had the urge to *sell* any of my holdings in response to market activity. This is not for lack of attention to the market. Many of you only look at your numbers every month or six months, but I update my spreadsheet every two weeks--an update that includes not just our investment accounts, but checking/savings/credit cards as well, to ensure that there are no unexpected charges and that our financial trajectory is hewing to course. I even look at the S&amp;P 500's performance every day, and while it's interesting to convert that number to how much we've ""gained"" or ""lost"" that day, I have literally *never* felt the urge to sell. Never even come close.

And then, this week.

I saw talk brewing about GME one evening after I'd had a few beers and was not yet ready to go to bed. The whole thing seemed very silly to me, especially the fact that r/wsb was getting in a froth about it, and yet I was in a suggestible mood. In particular, I remember thinking ""this seems like the kind of dumb thing Elon Musk will tweet about and send the price spiking."" I made an extremely out-of-character snap decision and placed an order for my very first ever individual stock purchase, then went to bed. Ever since then, I've been dealing with this **stupid, self-inflicted anguish**.

Why do I describe it as such?

* **Anguish**  
Watching the stock price jump around tugs at my emotions and commands my attention in a way I've never experienced before. I've seen the S&amp;P 500 sell off 2%, 3%, 5% in a day or a week and thought, ""huh, how about that?"" I've seen massive gains and thought, ""that's neat."" But the price of GME jumps one direction or the other and I'm transfixed. It's so fucking stupid and I hate that I can't tear myself away from it. When it's going down: oh shit, oh no, I can't believe it! This is terrible! When it's going up, it's quite possibly worse. Do I sell now? Do I wait for it to go up more? The indecision is paralyzing! Emotionally, it feels truly awful in a way I've never felt about money.  

* **Self-Inflicted**  
Of course, we all are ultimately the masters of our own money, but my decision to buy in feels like an especially bad own goal. I could perhaps forgive myself a little more if a bunch of friends and family had all decided to jump in with some fun money as a group, but no, this was just me getting buzzed by myself at night and following a herd of anonymous internet idiots into a stock purchase. And of course, getting out--or staying in--is just as much an individual decision. I'm accountable to nobody but myself on this, and whenever I fully cash out will prompt a moment of self-reckoning, the hope that I jumped off at the peak, and the potential for hindsight regret if the stock shoots up afterwards.  

* **Stupid**  
The worst aspect of all of this is how stupid all of this is, and how out of scale my self-inflicted anguish is when compared to the stakes on the table. I bought in for \[drumroll please\]...$1,000. That's it! Less than a tenth of a percent of our net worth! I have cheerfully parted with this much money and more with zero regrets in all sorts of circumstances, be it donating our stimulus checks, hiring a contractor, or purchasing something for the family or a vacation. It's such a small amount of money and I'm so fucking hung up on it. And that's not even the worst of it...  

* &gt;!Stupid, Stupid, Stupid
I have made money on this stupid trade! I have more than doubled my money, in fact! I bought in at $84ish and have already taken both my original $1,000 buy-in off the table as well as $1,000 in profits. I am now sitting on two remaining shares of GME. If they drop to zero, I will still have managed to double my money in &lt;48 hours. I have already won! Why do I feel so bad about it? And why do I care so much about this, when I'm down probably $20,000 in the index portfolio over the past five days and couldn't give a shit?!&lt;

The whole episode has been very illuminating in a funhouse mirror sort of way. All in all the story has a happy ending. I feel like my core principles are unchanged, and I don't expect to buy any more individual securities ever again. We still have $750,000, we'll still be index investing another \~$55,000 this year, and the trajectory of my FIRE journey has changed not one whit. 

But I have not yet closed out my position on my last two shares, and I feel like I'll be following GME's stock price for several days after I do. I am still stuck in the dumbest, tiniest web I could ever have spun for myself. Fortunately, writing this down feels like the first meaningful step I've taken to cutting myself out of that web.

**If you're playing the GME game this week, I'd love to know:**

1. **Is this your first time buying a stock, or are you a fun money picker?**
2. **Are you having fun with it, or are you kicking yourself?**
3. **If you're kicking yourself, is it because you're down or is it despite the fact that you're up?**

Moral of the story is that it is easy to get the FOMO from what is going on with WSB. But this is a pretty safe path and we will be better off then most people in life with the time retirement can buy. There are some smart people out there that saw this coming and I a routing for them. But I am also happy that we are VTSAX and chill.

I’m a 25 year old working as a civil engineer. I am currently renting a house with my gf who also makes good money (basically same as me). I currently make $76k and make around 80ish with OT. I’m starting a new job soon. The new job is 80k and overtime is time and half instead of straight time. I plan to be making roughly $85-90k based on the OT that was discussed. Their 401k is 50% match for the first 6% and 25% match on anything after that. 

Expenses
$1050 - my share of rent every year
$220 - bills/utilities

Assets
$62,000 - Cash
$4,000 - Robinhood
$15,500 - 401k

Debt
$16,500 - Govt student loans low interest
$23,800 - private student loans 3% fixed 5 year

Goals
I’d like to retire before 50
Buy a different car
Buy a house next year

I’m just looking for advice on what I should do with the amount of cash I’m holding onto? Should I max out my 401k to the max limit?

Thanks in advance for any advice.",financialindependence,Advice for 25 year old engineer,0
