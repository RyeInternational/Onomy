4550,"“Price search” and “price comparison” don’t exist for college because their financial aid websites tell us their pricing process is customized around the unique financial needs of every family. Tuition sticker prices are everywhere, and those are easy to compare, but only about 10% of college shoppers have the means for sticker price and end up paying it. The harder thing to search for is the “all-in cost after grants” because every college has its own financial aid office, its own endowment, and they all configure their pricing software differently. But financial aid awards are not “custom made” because there are too many financial aid packages for colleges to hand-produce every March (5m+ financial aid offers for new students).It turns out that most colleges use one of two software packages to configure the financial aid grant amount (Elucian or PowerFAIDS), and that the aid itself is algorithmic, performed in batches. But every college checks different flags in the software, and inputs different endowment amounts. Some colleges work hard to arrive at large grants and a low “all-in cost” that signals how much the college wants the student. Other colleges don’t put much work into this, because some students tend to show up anyways. For someone advising a student where to apply, it would be hard to catch this, since the colleges don’t put it on their websites. The key insight is that year after year, most colleges are pressing the same buttons in their financial aid software and delivering similar financial aid packages to students with similar family incomes. What this means for prospective students is that whatever financial aid packages a college configured two years ago, they are likely to do it again in the upcoming year.Now gets to the neat part - if only we could understand what aid packages a college built two years ago, across different sets of family incomes. These two pieces help us paint the picture: how many students are in an income bracket (say, $48k-75k), and what the average “all-in price” was that those students had to take out loans for (or pay the bill in cash, if they’re wealthier).This data can now be used to generate a high-impact application strategy where a student can target colleges on the all-in total cost they are likely to achieve, based on what students with similar family incomes paid two years ago. Students can also save on application fees, because seeing how colleges award aid (generously or like the grinch) can allow students to avoid applying to badly priced schools.
