(i'm pansexual and questioning if i'm agender or genderqueer)other prejudices--thinking people can reade her mind-any one in customer service is stupid/ she can be rude and expect they'll still be nice-everyone wants the best for her-shell do good for you and expect she can treat you like shit later but it's okay because she did something for you that you never needed or asked for (i get it's nice but ie: buying say a coffee and then saying something like im a burden in her life)other problems:-thinking i make her yell and get angry and upset when she does it to herself because she's very opinionated and i don't have control over say the guy pumping our gas or that i say forgot something that was her responsibility like not missing a gas station she passes while driving -she is financially abusive because i can't even keep ahold of my own money without her threatening me in the way of say not letting me see my friends**i need to see my friends because i need a break from being at home. i've gotten so depressed from not seeing them before they've become one of the only things that keeps me afloat abuse-verbally abusive and things she says is scary: ""all liars should die"" ""when you and (her bf) are sick next i'll fucking 'chicken soup you' and then you'll croak"" ""do you blow your bf with that mouth"" ""you're a fucking whore"" (i broke up with one bf and four months later found someone else i wanted to date) that also ties into  emotional abuse- she guilt trips me all the time and says she can do things because she's an adult even if it's ridiculous- physical abuse: she says away from this because she's been physically beaten belt style when young but she has still whipped a belt at me before, grabbed me, pulled my hair, slapped me with a metal ruler and threatened me in various ways including to crash a car while we're in it. nothing has been enough to leave a scar and mostly just to sting and be red for a bit ---also physically abusive to my things like destroying a 150$ tablet that was my last christmas gift from my father who is too disabled to know what time of day it is or what 1 plus 1 isdestroyed a government provided trac phone (bc low income)destroyed another phone (150$) that was a gift to me *** i can't have any privacy she if she wants to needs to be able to read through my texts and i can't have social media without her knowing (so she doesn't know about this account) because she'd want me to explain everything but do the adult thing where she doesn't actually listen and expect me to keep answering the same question. she'd question why i post anything or who people are and want to control everything - parenting is basically from the 50's like anything that happens in the house stays in the house (even if you want to kill yourself which i have because if this environment)- therapy is for insane people- mental health doesn't exist you're either okay and sane or you have a illegal problem that needs to be locked up (but it's okay for her to have anxiety which no one can say she has just her or shell tell at you)-bizzare weird things that just make me uncomfortable: she think she can just into the bathroom when i'm taking a piss or a shower even if i'm naked and want privacy -she will go to the bathroom if i'm say washing my face even though we have a second one -she keep telling at me to get out if the bathroom because she needs to go even if i do even though we have a second one-shell just be naked like say after a shower and say i'm in the bathroom doing something even though it's not a sight i want to see without warning-she pushes her way into all my doctors and everything appointments and doesn't understand no matter how many times people tell her what patients rights are and i have to have my doctors and what not just straight up lie to her it's that badi've sprinkled examples of her weirdness and how she's abusive and controlling and unsupportive.-------------------------------------------------------------***some things about me:i have depression and anxiety that have been clinical and even lead me to emergency services and therapy. i have indulged in self harm and binge drinking as a suicide attemptthis ties into why dcf didn't remove me because they couldn't see past the cutting and drinking even though i'd tell them why. this isn't all my problems but it strongly ties into my concerns and why i posted this:because of my legal history for stealing from my house and consumption of alcohol and past mental health outburst (going on 4 years ago) does this affect when i turn eighteen to go and not had my parents know anything. i plan on not signing anyway medial rights besides if i'm not able to give consent to medical procedures if i say get in a car crash and need surgery but can't respond. i won't give them financial power either. i need to know what i should do when i'm eighteen like how to get medical insurancei only work part time and make massachusetts minimum wage for 12 hours with a week's pay of 149$i do not have my lisence just a permitobviously no cari don't want to burden my friends parents too much even though i might stay with someone for a bit.--she would literally call all my friends and their parents and the police department when i'm eighteen as if they could do something about getting me back in the housei'm currently 17 turning eighteen in june just after high school graduationplanning on going to college for four yearsi'm mentally stable now despite my disordersi need to get out of my house if possible on the day i'm eighteensome complications include: -not having a car or licence-not having a lot of money -no siblings -no family to take me in-going to college soon-place to live/storage-i am adopted and the most official document i have is going to be my passport coming in. we had to give up my permanent resident card to give the okay that i'm actually a citizen (american parents adopting foreign children on touch her down of the plane in america = usa citizen but we had no official document )(i'd need to steal all my papers that i don't know where all of them are in the house)-when i leave if i don't take my pocessions insecret i might get physically asulted",7,1,"I need help when I'm eighteen (""running away"")",Adult
55,"if there is one thing you must know about me, it is expect the unexpected. if you actually get to know me in real life, i'm quite interesting in a crazy kind of way. i've been told most of my adult life that i'm very pretty. this was not the case until i graduated high school so i'm a girl with ""ugly duckling syndrome."" you know, the kind of girl that learns to be funny, sweet and likeable because they are ugly and they need some chance of survival in this cruel world. luckily, i grew into my looks and have a fun demeanor to boot!anyways, i'm a recovering addict. when i talk about my previous drinking or wild lifestyle, it seems like it was a different person. my friends endearingly came up with a name for my alter ego whom expressed herself frequently after flirting with hard liquor and usually involved poor decision making skills. i've always had my mom's strong will and my dad's temper. i saw a post on facebook the other day explaining that parents get mad at their children for being a younger exact version of themselves. i feel like that's true in my case. as a teenager, i had quite an attitude. i was told, ""these are the rules. if you don't like it, you can leave."" bye. i left, moved into a studio apartment my friend was renting which was virtually a party house for these 17-20 year old punks that had nothing better to do with their lives. my parents had no way to reach me... pre-cellphone era. they had no idea where i went. after weeks of searching, i was found and my presence was requested to come home with more lieneant rules, of course. bad idea on my parents part. their love blinded them to most things involving their only daughter and her shenanigans. so, needless to say... nothing is ever my fault. i'm always a victim of circumstances in my parents eyes. i also read on facebook a post stating, ""successful adulting: not stabbing someone when you really want to!"" there were a few comments of people tagging other people and a comment making a joke about not wanting to be an adult.  i commented on my friend's post, ""apparently i failed adulting."" no one has commented on the post since. the truth of the matter is, i really did stab someone... because i really wanted to. of course, an action like this doesn't come without consequences.  2 years supervised probation to be exact. loss of my career path. inability to find another job. the consequences were endless.... like a snowball effect. fortunately, or unfortunately, depends on your point of view, the victim of my stabbing survived with only a few stitches and hurt feelings. he is still very involved in my life today. when we argue nowadays, i usually mumble, ""i should've aimed better."" surprisingly, i was not on drugs or alcohol during that event either. just pregnant and hormonal.  i laugh about the entire situation now to stop from crying. i do not advise anyone to follow that decision. so, today i found out that i officially failed adulting from facebook's point of view. apparently, when people actually do have a history of stabbing a loved one and they make a joke on social media it creates that uncomfortable feeling of an elephant in the room and ceases further commentary. surprisingly, i'm ok with my failure of adulting. there are many other things i do excel at and my poor decision makes for some really sick and sarcastic jokes with my closest friends so it all works out in the enduntil next time, remember not to be to hard on yourself. if you can't live with yourself, how can anyone live with you?

67,"working from home (wfh) is a growing trend. there are legit work from home (telecommute) jobs out there. finding them is not that easy though. because a lot of them are scams. is work from home for you: you have to be timely. they track you. they want to make sure you are working. so they do keep track of your activity. you have to be self motivated. there is no boss down the hall watching you. rule: if it is too good to be true, it is a scam. no one is going to pay you $800 a week to collect checks, transfer money, mail things. it just doesnt happen. look for real companies with real, w2 jobs. how to look: search terms are important. work from home, telecommute, remote. every company that does work from home uses a different term. so, part of the search is finding out what term the company uses. what jobs: these are going to be mostly customer services, project management, analyst, and medical (phone rn), web/social media.  where to look: some of the top companies:amazon, united health group, conduent. but there are a lot of other companies. my suggestion: go to flexjobs.com . do not pay for an account. look at the sample jobs/prior listings that are free. learn what terms the company uses for wfh jobs. the go to that companies website and search for yourself. there are a ton of wfh jobs for teaching people to speak english. if this is something interesting to you, read reviews. it is independent contractor jobs and they are not easy to make money at as you have to get a good rating to get more students and you have to just sit and wait for someone to pick you. so, not ideal for everyone. applying: tailor your resume (we have a resume guide) to the job. it may take some time to make your current skills match what they are looking for. having a friend look over things can help as they are able to look at your experience differently. interview: it will be over the phone. so be prepared. smile. no one can see but they can hear it. write notes down. keep your resume handy. be professional. just because it is over the phone doesnt mean it isnt a job interview. so take it seriously.

154,"hello all,i'm having a few issues:i am done my undergrad 2 years ago. i'm 27 years old. i live with my family in toronto. i lived away from home during my undergrad and learn to live on my own.  it was still a definitely struggle, and i had a hard time managing my time with school. i studied political science and economics. i had a crush on this guy since high and he took up most of my mind during my undergrad so i didn't perform and wasn't really there in mind during classes, because he preoccupied my time. i then later ended our friendship because i realized i needed to focus on myself and finish school. there were times were i still couldn't stop thinking about him, felt lonely...only because i felt comfortable around him, but at the same was stressed when i was with him because i realized how insecure i was. i feel like i was super insecure.  i never knew if he had liked me or not. when i say i was with him, i mean we just hung out but weren't really in a relationship. i had trust issues with him and i'm not sure if it was me being insecure about myself.i graduated two years ago with a bachelors degree in political science and economics, but my grades were like crap. for a year i worked at a bank as a background screening analyst, and screened all candidates that applied to the bank and had to minimize risk for the bank. i really didn't like this job because i found it repetitive and very slow in terms of technology and process, which made me work overtime almost all the time. the management sucked.i feel like i did terrible in my undergrad because i had a hard time focusing due my personal issues. i have been going to a counsellor and trying to work on myself and feel like i need to work more on loving myself.right now, i decided to leave my job even though it paid out well, or enough, but i thought i can find another job that'd pay me better. i also find myself comparing myself to others who in careers such as accounting, nursing, engineers, doctors, or like i feel like i never knew what it was i wanted to do, and now that i'm 27, i have no friggen idea what i like. i feel like i'm not good at anything or know anything that is useful. something i'm good at is being supportive but i don't think it's something i want to have a career in. i feel like i am financially illiterate. i think i liked economics but i wasn't good at it because of pressure and personal issues again and the ability to not be able to focus. &amp;#x200b;i guess my question is how do you figure out what you like to do? i feel like what if i walk into accounting (esp because i never took any accounting courses in my undergrad) and don't end up liking it? right now, i'm taking a free digital marketing courses and a few courses on [lynda.com](https://lynda.com) on coding to open up job opportunities. i think i want to do my masters, but i did really poorly during my undergrad so i don't think i'll get in anywhere, and what if i do terrible during my masters and get into more debt?recently i found out the guy who i had a crush on since high school ( the same guy) is getting married and its triggered so much emotions. i think what i liked about him was that he knew so much and i think i was always insecure about my intelligence. i don't have a big family, and so socializing is hard when your family doesn't go to a lot socializing events, i'm not close to my family as he is to. he has a lot of cousins who hang out with each other, and do a lot of social things where they learn from one another.i feel like his wife is soo pretty, gorgeous, she was definitely a better choice than me, but i wish i had it all. shes a nurse, she not on social media all the time, i've seen her at the shops and she is just studying away and hasa  lot of focus. its super admirable and i wish i had that. i feel like it's exactly why i didn't want to be with him because i didn't think i was at his level and he could do better. i feel like if i want to be with someone that is like him, then i'm going to have to work on having all that...am i being too hard on myself?'i feel like some people know what they want in life and they are able to get it...why do people like me struggle? maybe it's because i don't spend enough time on my own?but then i also feel like i don't spend enough time with confident people. where can i find confident people in my life with good energy?  i feel like a complete mess. i don't know what i want in life.",4,7,Feeling super lost,Adult
194,"(again, i really hope this is a good subreddit on which to post this; also i live in the us)hi, i'm 18-19 and trying to move out asap - i've made a couple posts like this before asking similar questions, but i guess i'm just completely lost on what to do. i've been trying to set up a savings account in secret which my parents wouldn't have access to, except that to finish verifying my information, i need to submit front-and-back pictures of my driver's license (which i have) and my social security card (which happens to be missing).i've checked in a few places already and from what i remember when my dad and i recently just got the card replaced, i think he said ""he would hold onto it"", as he wouldn't trust me with something as important as that (though i also have a couple of other ideas as to where the card might be). i thought i would go over to [ssa.gov](https://ssa.gov) and log in, just to see if maybe i could find a copy of my card there that i could print out (probably can't do that though) except before logging me in they asked me to confirm my phone number - which is actually set to my dad's cell, and i'm pretty sure i would get into huge trouble if i changed it, especially without bothering to tell him.also if i tried to log in, wouldn't his cell phone notify him about this? i mean if so, i could just say i was curious as to where my card was because i simply ""don't remember"", but i don't want to be suspicious about it in any way.plus if i casually asked my dad if i could just switch his cell on the site over to mine, he might not even let me - i can't turn to my mom, she's x1000 times worse and is always over-suspicious that i could possibly be hiding something from her, so she would just make everything worse. and yes, i could simply switch his cell over to mine without his permission, but i'm way too scared to even do that. again, i'd get into huge trouble if/when my parents found out and they'd make my life into a living hell (again, especially if i didn't bother to tell them about this). my mom's narcissistic (pretty sure my e-dad is too), so i have to act like i'm not trying really hard to become independent and all that. i can't be suspicious in the slightest.i just don't know how to go about this and i'll really appreciate any feedback you guys might have.thank you.",12,1,Question about social security card (sorry I keep making little question-posts like these I'm just really lost),Adult

94,"i'm currently 24 years old, and i'm just getting in gear to go back to school this fall.i'm gonna be real honest when i say i was kind of a shitty kid. i skipped school a lot, and barely graduated after completing packet classes every summer. i absolutely loathed high school and don't look back at that time fondly. i was lucky, though--i'm an above average writer, and despite my failings i did get an ap credit for english out of the way. i'm 3 credit hours ahead of the game.the six-year break i took has really given me perspective, and i feel like i've wasted a substantial part of my life, if only in regards to getting my degree. i got a pretty rude awakening when i moved out at 18, and have been kicking myself for not staying home and going to school right away ever since. so, now, i'm aiming kind of high (for me, anyway) and want to get my masters degree in social work, specifically with youth (at risk teens and so forth). i want to do this as quickly as possible,  since my goal is to start a family before i'm 30. this leads into my current situation. looking at the roster for general education, most of the required credits just seem... stupid easy, with the exception of maths. mind you, this is a community college. intermediate writing, film and culture, and even meditation are acceptable for general education fulfillment. i work a very easy full time overnight job where i'm basically just required to stay awake, and can bring whatever i need to do that. with how low impact this job is, i would like to do 15 credit hours (approx. 5 classes per semester) to get my associates of art out of the way in a year and a half.i would just like to hear from people in similar situations. what would you have done differently? is this even doable? any thoughts, suggestions, or emotional outbursts?",5,2,Need some advice about school...,Adult

1335,"if anyone reading this is like my friends then i imagine i may get some heat. i welcome a good discussion on this topic.....here's a small background of my life to get where i am coming from. i grew up poor but in a good neighborhood. didn't do well in highs school but kicked into gear in college. i worked 37 hour weeks while going to school fulltime. i graduated college early and never slept. went to state school because that is all i could afford and spent zero money on things i didn't need. it was hard. any time a friend wanted to go out to dinner or go bowling it was always a no from me, i cut my own hair, shopped only when i needed. i realized the money i had was for school and i sacrificed the social aspects to not be in a bad place in the future financially. i worked extra hours to prove to my boss i deserved a promotion which made my friends say that i am taking my job too seriously, where i just wanted it on my resume. they enjoyed joking around having fun and i decided to wait to have fun when i could afford it (i do enjoy life now :) )im not some genius, i just work hard and deal with anxiety, depression and all that. i come out of college and put every dollar i made at slightly above min wage to pay off loans because that was important to me. flash forward to 10 years out of school, i hold a high level position and my friends seem to think it was easy. they complain that they will never pay off their loans and still live with parents and take the low paying jobs. i don't love my job, i am working to afford a life where i can save for a future and provide for my family when the time comes. save for the rainy day. like the ant and the gross hopper story. my friends love their jobs and they make crap money and complain all the time that they can't make ends meet. they get mad at me for being financially okay and blame the world. i agree that the world has its issues but i also see my friends spend money on getting gel manicures and going on nice trips and still can't pay off loans. when i am asked for advice i tell them don't pay for cable or shop at price chopper not whole foods and i am looked at like i am asking them to rip their own hearts out. don't get me wrong, i love to enjoy nice things now so i get the lure. i still don't pay for cable and paint my own nails, i just got used to going without. my friends live with more luxuries making less money than i do with more. i am constantly asked to help my friends with money when they can't pay rent then show me their beautifully polished nails. i even paid phone bills for years for my friends with kids. i understand that people work hard, but i am seeing that many people don't work smart. i hadn't gone on a vacation my entire life and my friends claim they ""need"" it because life is hard. i understand wanting to relax but maybe go to the beach? (we do live on the coast). if you can't afford it, youll be more stressed later. i am the bad guy with my friends alot for being real. the friends ive helped have gone on far more vacations than i ever have. my friends tell me that it's just ""harder"" for them than me to wake up at 4am to drive 2 hrs to work because that's the job i could get at the time that paid what i needed. it's not not hard, i do it because i have to. now that i have nicer things, i am told alot about how hard they are struggling. i don't see the struggle with them. i see my friends make bad decisions and ask me to bail them out. they want the easy jobs because they can't handle stress. truth is, i can't either. i hate stress and i push my anxious limits every day. this finally hit a boiling point with me because my close friend asked to move in with my husband and i because she can't afford rent and we have extra rooms which are each of our offices. she works parttime by choice because more than 32 hours is too stressful. i explain that i work 60+hours a week to be able to not live with other people. i am an introvert and i don't want roommates. i am told i am a bad friend for this. i just feel that if i have no say in how my friends waste their money then i shouldn't have to give up the life i worked to be uncomfortable to cater to them.

1508,"hi everyone. my sister thinks she might be trans and i’m struggling to support her while not understanding trans issues or trans identity in general. i’ve never understood the concept. i respect trans people, but i just don’t get it because i don’t believe genders exist. i’m coming from a place of trying to understand, so i apologize in advance if i write anything that sounds ignorant. although i’m female biologically, i don’t care about genders whatsoever. i don’t see it as part of my identity and i see gender as just another social construct that doesn’t exist. i affiliate with my talents (art, music, marketing), but nothing else. i believe i am who i am, not what i am, as i can choose who i am, but what i am (22f) is a matter of coincidence, so that doesn’t define me.all that being said: is it possible that i could ever understand trans people? since i don’t believe in genders, i default to feeling that people are only subscribing to genders, trans and otherwise, because they care about what society thinks too much. they feel certain colors, fashion, or activities/behaviors belong to a certain gender, and so they need to subscribe to the wonder labels or change to a new label for society to accept them. this is incredibly sad to me. though i’m a girl, i play video games and do things that are expected of a guy, but i don’t care what others think of me. i don’t feel that i should be a guy just because i do things society stereotypically assumes are male. i don’t need to be accepted or respected by others, cause i’m enough as i am to me. i don’t care about my physical form because what i say and do is what makes up who i am in my eyes. although society assumes that men and women own certain characteristics, personalities, etc, in reality i don’t think anyone owns anything. i think anyone can be anything as they are, and if society doesn’t like it, then they should be forced to accept others via us being who we are — rather than people picking or changing their gender so others can accept them. i’m concerned that my sister thinks she’s trans because she doesn’t like who she is, due to her weight, being bullied, being a tomboy, etc, rather than she’s discovering who she always was. i don’t know what to do. i’m very confused about how to approach this, and honestly, so is my sister. thanks in advance for your responses.",4,0,My sister might be trans and I’m struggling to support her because I don’t understand trans identity and issues.

1815,"if university is elementary school,grad school is middle school,andphd is high school,then i'm back to constantly wishing i was in high school again. 'high schoolers' seem to be able to do whatever they want and have more independence, get to travel more, get to study in their field of choice and do real-world stuff and research, go to awesome conferences and learn important interesting stuff and eat good quality food, not shitty dining common food, and seem to be socially allowed to feel confident and secure with themselves (or as secure as a human can get).i can't wait til i'm in high school!(ok but fr, i know the whole college-masters-phd system is messed up rn and there're so many issues, don't even get me started on the crippling debt, but just ignore all that, suspend your disbelief, and pretend you're a kid when you're reading that)but seriously, about that last part, i'm going to go on a tangent. although college life has been ok so far, i don't think i'll ever fully be satisfied with where i am in life. right now, i'm pretty secure about who i am and what i want to do, as well as what makes me comfortable, my beliefs, and my personal standards for myself and others. but for some reason i feel pressured to feel insecure about everything. i feel like i should care more about how others perceive and judge me, although i truly don't care at all unless the situation truly calls for it (job interviews and such). i feel like i have a good sense of social awareness, but i also feel like i unintentionally come off as intimidating or a jerk. it's just for some reason here at this university, the constant lectures and bulletins keep encouraging people that it's ok not not have everything figured out, that it's ok to not be this and that, and i know i might be blowing things out of proportion, but it seems like if these bulletins don't apply to you, then what are you even doing here? you must be doing something wrong. you should feel insecure about everything. so sometimes i go through the day wondering if i should give more fucks about the smaller stuff and start thinking about the insecurities i currently have. i know it's not good to give no fucks at all, rather it's better to pripritize them for the important things with a limited supply instead of giving them out freely.for instance, whenever i'm out with college friends, they sometimes compliment me about how i seem to have all my shit figured out, although i really don't. my roommate constantly degrades her appearance, asking me if she looks ugly, if she should change something, if she should join this club, if i can go out with her, etc. and i usually just compliment her or tell her it's fine and doesn't matter that much, or whenever i'm exhaused don't say anything at all, but then she gets offended and continues degrading herself and it's awkward. i feel simultaneously more put together and insecure whenever situations like this happen, because i have my own insecurities about things, and this puts me into an existential crisis about my stage in life, and i feel even more pressured to bring them up to be more relatable, although i can't, because would they really understand? i brought some of them up with my roommate and one other friend once, on two seperate occasions, and they both shut me down, instead telling me something along the lines of 'wow you seem to have your shit figured out.' but that doesn't make me feel better or help at all. i'm not particularly stressed about exams, but i feel like i'm doing something wrong by sleeping early and playing video games during most of the day. i used to go out a lot when i was a teenager in real middle and high school, but now that i'm an adult i rarely feel fomo whenever a party happens anymore (which is like every single day) or whenever people are going out doing stuff. for some reason, i feel like i should feel fomo even though i prefer staying in. what i really want is to surround myself with just a few high-quality people i feel comfortable with and have shared hobbies and values with, and get together sometimes, if not routinely, but it seems almost impossible to find. people here either want to go out constantly or not at all, and even though it's easy making friends, i can't keep them down.what can i do to catch up to everyone else? i always feel behind, like i'm not doing enough, maybe i should take on another project? but my old ones won't get finished, and i always get to a point where i'm stuck. but if i don't do this, how will i get ahead and stand out when it comes to employment? i want to pursue projects i'm genuinely interested in, but should i care more about employment-related ones? and also, i don't even have the proper skillsets to finish the ones i'm working on. everyone's on linkedin, instagram, and whatsapp now, getting married, traveling for conferences and work, and there's me, happening to get really passionate about the field i want to get into 10 years too late and trying to stay off social media, yet still creating accounts to not fall behind. then there's the guy my age who just retired after teaching a graduate-level course for his entirety of high school years in the field because he got really into it right on time. but then i'm super jealous because intead of falling into the ratrace like me and everyone else, he decided to pursue what he was passionate about and perfect his skills instead of mindlessly going through preschool cramming for useless aptutude tests that really don't measure the quality of the individual or the aptitude. it's like we're all in a lab but people like him escaped somehow.then i have to make sure to stay above a 3.2 gpa, but if i don't get near a 4.0 then my chances at being accepted into the other college decrease by something like 80%. i constantly feel stupid, especially in language classes where i'm learning at an elementary level and still get confused from time to time.i know i should care more about living my best life and stop comparing myself to others, but it gets difficult whenever i think about things like this. although i stopped caring about social media and trends around 5 years ago, now it seems like i have to start again just to be able to have something to talk about, but i'm not really interested so i don't for the most part.that's why whenever i'm with my friends who are pursuing their masters/phd, i feel simultaneously secure and insecure about myself as well. i feel like it's more socially acceptable to act and feel confident about myself and give less fucks about small things like appearance or trends, so it's less of a social burden, and i feel less anxiety and more comfortable around them, but at the same time i feel behind and wish i could be where they are now, especially the ones who are in the field i want to get into. i especially hate it whenever they tell me 'you'll figure it out eventually' because i feel even more behind. around my college friends, i'm the one who has things figured out. around my other friends, i'm the one with tons of potential who will eventually have things figured out. i hate being told i have it all figured out, but also hate being told the opposite.either way i still feel discontent and insecure about my stage in life in general. i feel like i'm going through a quarter-life crisis, does anyone else feel the same way?",0,3,"If university is elementary school for adults, then I'm back to wishing I was in high school again.",Adult

2174,"before i (f/19) begin this post, i just want to say that my mom (f/47) is a great person and has raised me quite well, but, i have some concerns. my mom and dad split up tons of times during my childhood and got a divorce by the time i was 13. that didn’t really affect me emotionally because my brother (m/23) and i saw it coming, but the fact that we weren’t completely financially stable once my dad officially moved out on his own was a problem. since then my mom has been doing everything on her own completely. supporting my brother and i, going back to university to get her degree while working full time. these past couple of years, she hasn’t made much money,but she has made just enough to support us. once my brother and i got jobs, we (of course) had to support our own personal finances/expenses, (phone bill, shopping etc) to help ease the load on our mom.once my mom realized we were making a bit of money she started asking for help. of course, she hated doing this because who really wants to ask their teenage children for money...at the time i was 16 and my brother was 20. he was fully capable of helping her but he was also way too immature and resented her for asking for some help. me on the other hand, always wanted to help my mom because she’s done so much for us. so during high school i sent my mom money willingly here and there and she always paid me back, unless i told her not to bother. fast forward to today, my brother has somehow gotten a good paying job at the bank and instead of sticking around to help us out a bit with rent, he moved out at the first chance he got. with all of these money issues that she’s had, it’s made her bitter and angry. my brother and her didn’t get along so well as he grew up and wanted to help less and less (after he moved out they started getting along pretty well again). now that my brother is moved out, my mom relies on me to buy groceries with my minimum wage/three shifts a week job or any extra funds i receive. once again, she hates to ask this but she has no choice. i do pay all of my own bills and i have a strict budget because of this. along with that, my mom talks to me about all of her finance issues and always has since her and my dad split for good. this has made the thought of money awful for me. i told her she needs more friends or to even try dating again and she denies that she needs to. the only reason she doesn’t think she needs to be social is because she has me. this has put so much pressure on me to make sure that i’m attentive to her issues and i save my money just in case she drowns. in addition to that, she has just finished 6 years of university and is trying to find a job in her field now. all of the stress that she has put up with has made her essentially give up on taking care of her body and keeping up with some house work. overall, at this point, i feel almost like a parent to my mother at this point because i’ve had to grow up so much faster than i should have and this allows her to lean on me more than i’m comfortable with. in all, i would like to be on my own financially and in general but i’m almost scared of leaving her behind one day because i think she will feel completely alone due to the fact that she hasn’t realized how much she relies on me. any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated. once again i just want to say that my mom is still a great person to me, this is mostly about finance and gaining some individuality and separation, is all.",22,30,My mom relies on me too much and doesn’t realize it.,Adult
2214,"i (29f) recently graduated with my two bachelor’s degrees in the humanities and have a sporadic work history (currently unemployed). i have always been financially dependent on my parents and they enable this as well. i think i am also somewhat emotionally dependent on them. i do live in an apartment in a different state and take care of my basic everyday needs alright- when not too depressed. i am starting to realize how being allowed to do (almost) whatever i wanted growing up, not being expected to adult someday, not having responsibilities outside of attending school (homework was up to me), growing up socially isolated (i am deaf, from a rural area, and was left home alone a lot), and not having any discussions about the future and life skills have affected me. my parents have always been “laissez-faire” and tell me “don’t worry. you will have x (friends, good career, relationship, etc) someday” without advising practical actions. i somewhat struggle with delayed gratification which impacts my life now. i have been unsuccessful at getting them to partner with me in terms of enabling me less so that when things get hard, i can’t just automatically use their money or go to them for advice. they generally listen but don’t see what the big deal is. mom also doesn’t want to say “no” to anything i want in life- she explicitly stated this. if they won’t help me, then i know i got to figure these things out on my own while dealing with my own mental illnesses. i have a hard time not resenting them, especially my mom, for not being more of a “parent” then and now. it’s one thing to be a kid/teen/adult and ignore your parent’s advice...it’s another thing not to get much advice or information from the people in your life/environment (due to being deaf and socially isolated) so you kind of flounder around. for example, i didn’t know until this past year or two how a sporadic work history on a resume would appear to an employer, even if i left those jobs to travel internationally, because everyone told me that “anyone would be lucky to have me / great employee.” i have always been the “good kid,” quiet, smart, and 8th grade and up maintained a very high gpa because i learned great grades/performance = more attention from people, making it easy to fly under the radar as far as needing support. to be fair, my parents are not good models for some things so of course they can’t teach me those things. for example, we have debt, their house is a mess, and in many ways dad mooches off of mom. how do i (long-term) get over feeling resentful toward mom each time we talk on the phone?",9,1,How to move on about what my parents didn’t (and still don’t) do?,Adult

2710,"lately i've been feeling the need to work on some fundamental things that come up often in my life, but it's hard to know where i can go for answers. sometimes it's because i feel like the question is about a really basic life or social skill.example: how do i know when my conduct is appropriate? how do i judge if a question is impertinent versus pushing the envelope in a positive way in a classroom or workplace setting?sometimes it's just a complicated issue that i'm not sure who would have the answer to.example: i am a leader in situations where i am reasonably in control of situations. among friends, i'm buoyed up to be the one who decides everything from what we're doing for a reunion to what's the best way to help someone move house. but when i'm assigned to a group for a college class project, i lock up. i want to do everything, because i feel that i cannot work well with my groupmates and fear their expectations for the project criteria will be different or lower than mine (100% grade chaser here). how do i turn assigned groupwork into a chance to grow my leadership skills, rather than an awful stressful experience? what can i do in those situations to ensure that the groupwork goes smoothly, without needing to worry that the ""cs get degrees"" groupmates will want to do something different than what i want to do?and sometimes it's because i have no idea how to present an issue, especially if i feel like whoever i'm asking really has to understand who i am and where i'm coming from to understand how to answer without assuming some generalized truth that may or may not apply to my situation. example: i struggle with a war between not wanting to be arrogant but also recognizing &amp; utilizing my skills. i don't want to ""be better than other people"", but there are some settings when it's clear that of the pool of people around me, i have the most experience or knowledge about the task at hand. how does one step up honestly about their abilities in a non-arrogant way, without undervaluing themselves? it seems to me like i can only be at one extreme or the other.with these types of questions, i have no idea who to go to. they feel too personal to bring up with professors i barely know at times, and i've had mixed luck asking peers at the same stage in their life as me.where should i be going?",7,6,Where do you go with hard questions/needing advice when you lack mentors/parental figures you trust/admire?,Adult

3235,"i grew up in low income communities watching my mom struggle to raise me and my brothers. and i always told myself that my ultimate goal in life is just to be comfortable. to be able to buy those new pair of shoes or go to starbucks every day 3 times a day just because without having to worry about if i’m going to have enough money to grocery shop.i’m not 23 and i just graduated (this past may) with my bs in health care admin, magna cum lauded with a minor in hr. which i’m super excited about. but i’m scared shitless to do anything really. i have the gpa to get into really good grad  programs but i would rather wait until i had at least 2-3 years of experience, especially since my life has been all work no play and i can’t seem to decide on a program(do i want to do social work, mba, mph, mpa?). so i really want to just relax and get to know myself outside of being a student because i honestly don’t really know who i am. i’m currently working full time at my internship mom grateful they hired me and i’m getting experience in my field. but i’m terrified of looking for a new job because where i currently live (in the city i went to school) i would have to commute 45+ minutes to work one way. and i don’t really like that because the last time i had a commute that long i got in car accident on the freeway. i i’m don’t have the money to be able to afford another car if that was to happen. and moving to those cities where the jobs are is almost impossible without the job because the cost of living there is absolutely ridiculous. and lowkey the pay is not where i personally think it should be. i have an apartment with 3 roommates right now. we each pay 600 for a shared room. but it comes furnished and includes pretty much everything (wifi utilities cable laundry onsite). i want to move out. but like i know that the going rate for a single room is about 1000. and i don’t have that right now unless i get a new job. but that goes back to me being scared. i want to move back home. probably because i know at least i have a safety net. but also because i miss my family. my little brother is 17 and is leaving for the army shortly after is 18th birthday since he’s graduating high school early. i want to be home to spend more time with them all when he comes back. it also doesn’t help that my family and all of my best friends that live down there or moved back after school keep telling me that they wish i was there. because i freaking wish that too. and i kinda hate driving 2 hrs oneway to visit home. my goal for moving home is to stay with my mom for 6- months to a year depending on when i find a job. and then move to a city in the county that is still fairly close but far enough to be independent. i keep thinking i’m gonna wake up and be middle aged with everything figured out. and it hasn’t happened yet. when i tell you that i’ve focused on school so much and the end goal. i mean it 100%. but also while i focus on the end goal of me being comfortable and i’m this amazing career. i never really paid attention to the in between. and i feel like now i’m in the in between and i don’t know what to do. do i move home where it might be a little tougher to find a job in my field. or do i stay here but have to deal with the insane cost of living and the commuting. when do i look for a new job?i have these goals for myself but i feel like i’m in this post grad limbo where i’m just to scared to do anything about it. my “adult” friend as i like to call her as she is about 10 years older than me. suggested i read quarterlife crisis. and so far it’s describing where i’m at right now. my friends where i live now keep telling me that “i’m exactly where i need to be” and that “everything will work itself out” but why does it feel like it won’t? i also feel like they’re tired of me talking abut it. the positives in my life is that i’m forcing myself to try new things. and doing things that interest me. i created a blog about health care 2 years ago. but i’m currently revamping/creating a new one that’s literally just gonna be about whatever i i’m interested in. i figured this would be a good way to keep track of my interest hobbies and to self reflect. idk. it’s something right?i just wish i wasn’t scare. but i also wish that i had some kind of roadmap or something. thanks for listening/reading.",1,3,I am sooo very terrified of adulting and making life changing decisions.,Adult

3535,"in literally just 3 days i’m turning 21. the big 21. the age when everyone considers you as a real adult and starts taking you more serious. ever since i was around 12/13, i’ve had horrible social anxiety and sadly a huge lack of a social life. i mean i was popular in school, nobody was mean to me, most people loved me because i was sweet and kind. i talked to my mom about my lack of social life and she said it’s because i was just so quiet it just made me seem unapproachable, which i believe her. like i said, people really liked me. i just never really talked unless i was spoken to first, or had to talk for certain reasons. i could never hold a conversation and still can’t. one, because i have a fear of saying something and it will sound stupid and embarrassing, and two, i just genuinely never know what to say as stupid as that sounds. i get all panicky when socializing. so i most likely came off as rude and uninterested. in school i would get invited to hang out with others and join them in some activities. i just too quiet and everyone thought i was just simply “shy.” it wasn’t until only a few years ago i realized it went much more deeper then just shyness and that’s when i figured i have social anxiety. like it’s hard for me to order my own food from restaurants or fast food places for example, although recently it has sort of gotten better. not quite, but a little. i used to always have my mom order my food for me. same thing for paying for anything like food, clothes, groceries, etc... and you’re not gonna believe this, but at almost 21, i’ve actually never payed for groceries yet and i’ve only ever payed for my own clothes like maybe twice in my life. i hate to stay it but i still cling to my parents like a helpless child because of my anxiety. so i really feel like it has caused me to be so emotionally behind everyone my age. i never even went to university or college. while most people my age are already about to graduate and have moved out of their parents house. and i’m not gonna lie when i say that moving out terrifies me so freaking much. luckily i have parents who say i can live with them for as long as i want. they actually love having me around. but i feel embarrassed. i’ve never even had a “real” job. i only just got my first job cleaning a bank after they close for a little over an hour monday-saturday. super easy. but it’s only $500 a month. my mom is also doing that job with me too. i hate it so much that i’m like this and i feel so embarrassed and ashamed of myself. i’ve only ever had two best friends my whole life and that’s it. one who i’m still best friends with to this day since kindergarten and the other i haven’t seen since around 2013/2014 because she had to move and we just lost contact with each other. but yeah. i’ve never had an actual “friend group” like the majority of people my age and younger. and i seriously feel like my time is running out to get out there and make many friends and memories. kim taehyung, my idol is a social butterfly who’s always been popular even before idol life. he’s always been able to make friends and he’s always been very popular. in school and now. why can’t i be like that? why am i the exact opposite of that? and i feel like that if he ever met me he would hate me and think i’m so boring and want nothing to do with... and i know he’s not shallow like that. but my mind tells me all these things. like why would a social butterfly wanna even try to be friends with a boring girl with bad social anxiety and has no social life? it would be such a waste of time for someone like him. and honestly, i just d word because of the way i am especially at my age. it hurts and it eats at me every single day of my life.",2,1,(Serious) I’m literally anxious af about adulthood and growing up,Adult

3683,"23f and earlier this year i moved into the first place where i live on my own. it's a house converted into an upper and lower apartment and the landlady lives in the lower unit. she's nice enough, but has a lot of quirks that drive me up a wall. one, she's a conspiracy theorist and with this pandemic i haven't heard the end of it. and two, aka the issue that is fucking with my routines the most, she contradicts herself constantly. examples include:-the previous tenant messed up the electricity and made some lights and sockets unusable until she can get an electrician out, so she said she would take off a little bit of last months rent to compensate. she ended up talking about how my rent is her only income and so she could really only take off like $10.-i have a dog and the written lease says ""regular poop pickup"", which i have been doing every week on wednesday since trash gets collected thursday mornings. that's a routine we specified when i signed the lease in the first place. now the weather is getting warmer she wants it more than once a week which i understand.  i had planned on upping it to 3 times a week or every other day anyways depending on how often my dog went #2. she is trying to say that when i had signed the lease she had already told me to up poop pickup to every day barring bad weather when it got warm. she definitely did not. she said ""regular"" and i had been keeping to a schedule but i don't necessarily have the time or the amount of trash bags handy to pick up poop every day. -because of covid-19, we came up with a plan for my rent this month. she can't waive it because, as specified, my rent is her only income. i had some issues with my job before the social distancing issues. basically i had gotten another job offer and start date, quit my existing job in preparation, and then never heard anything because the pandemic started becoming more serious and messing with business procedures. she understood that it was a sticky situation and said this: "" try to come up with at least half or 3/4 if you can, and we can take the rest out of the security deposit for now to at least pay the house bills (water and heat). we can work out replacing the security deposit later"". i got a signed note giving her permission to do so from the family who co-signed with me. now she is saying she really isn't supposed to and doesn't want to dip into the deposit at all and is pressuring me to collect unemployment money (which im trying to work out but my state is being stupid) and pay the rest of the rent asap. like, we had a plan set and now she is messing with it. she said she won't evict me given the circumstances and she is nice and neighborly otherwise but her contradicting herself all the time is getting on my last nerve. that and she tends to overshare and turn her personal issues into my issues too. but i feel weird confronting her about any of it because i'm an inexperienced renter and have bad credit because of financial medical issues when i was in college, and she was one of the only landlords in the area that looked past the credit and understood that i'm trying my best to rebuild and even then it was a close call because she would only rent to me if my family cosigned. so i feel like i'm looking a gift horse in the mouth if i confront her. that and i'm not sure i could get another place right now and i can't move in with family because that's just a toxic living situation in itself.tldr my landlady was nice enough to rent to me but a lot of aspects of her personality are driving me insane and i'm afraid of confronting her and seeming ungrateful",22,8,Landlady contradicts herself and it's driving me up a wall.

4938,"let’s start with some basics you may need to know before you get out into the real world by yourself.**what you need to know*** begin by establishing a deadline for when you want to move out. chances are that neither you nor your parents want you living at home forever. so, first, talk to your parents about both your and their expectations for how long you will be living with them. this will give you an idea of how long you have to save, to budget, to search for a new place, and to prepare for #adulting.* next, you need to create a realistic budget. it is imperative that you budget and save during this time with your parents. some parents might ask you to pay rent while others might not. regardless, begin practicing your budgeting skills by setting aside how much you think you will pay in rent every month plus the amount you would need for bills and any “going out” money. keep in mind that housing, transportation, and food will be the majority of your budget. if you allocate your money properly, you should be able to begin saving for your own place. it is important that you know what you are budgeting for. in other words, are you planning to rent an apartment or are you hoping to purchase your own home? the choice can seem overwhelming; especially if this will be the first time you are living on your own. however, for some people who lived in a rental during college, they might feel ready to buy a place. here is a rundown of important questions to ask, what is included when renting an apartment or house, and the pros and cons of buying.**renting**there are some expenses associated with renting a property you will need to consider. some apartments, houses, or duplexes include utilities in the rent while others do not. in addition, you will need to furnish your new place unless it is pre-furnished. cable and internet are two more expenses you will need to consider when moving into a new apartment. finally, many people get renters insurance which covers damage or loss of property. when you are starting your rental search, look on property management or realtor websites, online listings on sites such as zillow or trulia, ask friends, or go to online forums for the city you live in or are planning to move to and ask for advice on the best places to live on your budget. compare different rental properties before deciding. make a list of what you want in a rental. make sure the properties fit within your budget. take a tour of each  option so you can see them in real life and get a sense of how you would fit into the complex. when touring, and before signing a rental agreement or application, ask whether the rental price will go up if you do not sign by a certain deadline. questions to ask during your rental search:* how much is rent and when is it due? how is it paid? online, in person, by mail , etc. *  what is the length of the rental agreement? *  who pays utilities? how do i set them up? * what amenities are available? are there any extra charges for them? *  what is the policy for guest parking and pets? * who pays for maintenance on my apartment? whom do i contact? *  what are the eviction terms?after you have chosen your apartment, you are ready to sign your rental agreement. you may have to pay a security deposit, which may or may not be refundable at the end of your lease. the property may also ask you to pay first and last month’s rent and/or have a co-signer. the rental company may need additional information such as who is living in the apartment, your income or employment information, rental history, references, and a credit history check. always read the rental agreement and ask any questions you have before you sign.**buying** having a stable house payment allows you to incorporate that expense into your household budget much easier. although it is possible for your mortgage payment to increase over time because of changes in insurance fees and property taxes. if you have a fixed-rate loan, your principal and interest payment will remain set for the life of the loan, which could be as long as 30 years. many people view home ownership as an investment with potential return. in addition to building equity with your monthly mortgage payment, the value of your home could increase in value. finally, home ownership offers the owners a sense of stability and freedom, knowing that you have a place of your own to meet the needs of your family. although buying a home can be very exciting and has many benefits, it is also important to think about the disadvantages associated with home ownership. in many cases, monthly rent at an apartment complex would be less than a monthly mortgage payment. * some of the monthly costs of home ownership include: * your mortgage payment, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance. *  in most cases, if you do not have a 20 percent down payment, lenders will require you to pay private mortgage insurance (pmi), which is an additional expense* as a homeowner, you must either make repairs yourself or pay someone to do the work. • often with home ownership, you have reduced flexibility, meaning you will most likely need to sell or rent your house before you can move.*  finally, the opportunity to build equity is generally considered an advantage to home ownership. however, it is important to realize there are no guarantees that a home will increase in value. consider this after carefully weighing the pros and cons of home ownership, there is something else to consider before making your decision to buy or rent: how long you plan to live at the residence. depending on the housing market, it may make financial sense to rent instead of buy. although an advantage to buying is the buildup of equity while you are living there (as opposed to paying rent to a property owner), there are several upfront fees called “closing costs” associated with setting up a mortgage. if you plan to live in a home for a short time, consider how much your home value would need to increase before you would recoup the fees you paid in closing costs, in addition to any real-estate broker fees you would pay when selling the house. because it can be difficult to predict the realestate market, buying doesn’t always make sense. **four c’s of credit***  capital is the amount of cash you have available. as part of the home-buying process, you usually will need capital for the down payment, loan fees, closing costs, reserves, and moving expenses. * capacity is your ability, based on your income, to pay your new mortgage payments as well as your other debts and living expenses. your capacity is calculated based on your current income, income history, future earning potential, and amount owed, including car payments, student-loan payments, credit card accounts (visa, mastercard, etc.), and any other monthly payments.*  credit refers to your credit report and credit history. if you do not have a credit history, you will need to go through the process of building a credit history with receipts and payment slips showing regular monthly payments to property owners and utilities. * collateral will be your new home. the lender will do an appraisal of the home you decide to purchase to determine the value of the house. collateral provides the  lender with security on the loan if the borrower defaults (or does not pay the mortgage). a general rule of thumb to determine how much you would be able to qualify for is 2.5 to 3 times your gross annual income. this is assuming that you are in good financial shape, have a steady income, low debt, a sizeable down payment, and good credit. using this as a guideline, a family earning $60,000 a year, would probably qualify for a loan between $150,000 and $200,000. mortgage lenders often use ratios to determine the maximum loan amount for a borrower. two common ratios used by lenders are housing expense-to-income ratio and debt-to-income ratio. • the housing expense-to-income ratio represents the maximum percent of the borrower’s gross monthly income that can be used for the house payment. twentyeight percent is a common percentage, but different lenders will have different percentage requirements, normally ranging from 25 percent to 33 percent. using 28 percent as an example, if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend each month on your house payment, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (piti) is $560. ($2,000 \* .28 = $560). • debt-to-income ratio is another number often calculated by lenders. the debt-to-income ratio represents the maximum percentage of the borrower’s gross monthly income that can be used for all debts, including the house payment. typically, to be able to qualify for a loan, lenders will have a preset limit between 36 percent and 41 percent. if your loan has a maximum limit of 36 percent, and if your gross monthly income is $2,000, the maximum amount you could spend on your home mortgage plus all other debts, such as car payment, student loan, etc., is $720. ($2,000\*.36 = $720). &amp;#x200b;want to move out of your parents’ basement? follow this guide to begin budgeting, saving, and planning your move. if you pay off loans, take care of your credit, and weigh your options carefully, you will be living independently in no time at all.&amp;#x200b; [http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/fcs5/fcs5474/fcs5474.pdf?fbclid=iwar3wh\_4ituhslenv0u3zsl4vmwc6mnyb9jfzspxq7iy\_svfsx\_ckylfxsf0](http://www2.ca.uky.edu/agcomm/pubs/fcs5/fcs5474/fcs5474.pdf?fbclid=iwar3wh_4ituhslenv0u3zsl4vmwc6mnyb9jfzspxq7iy_svfsx_ckylfxsf0)  ^(educational programs of kentucky cooperative extension serve all people regardless of economic or social status and will not discriminate on the basis of race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, marital status, genetic information, age, veteran status, or physical or mental disability.)",0,1,Moving Out of Your Parents’ Basement: Should You Buy or Rent?,Adult

5036,"in two months i will be 21 and that really terrifies me. 21 really seems like a big adult age, but i don’t even feel like one at all. i still feel like a teenager. i still get excited over the littlest things, and the things that i’ve enjoyed since i was 15, like kpop and anime, i still love cute things like plushies, i still act just as silly and goofy as i did when i was younger, i get hyper like a tween on a sugar rush (that might sound funny lol), and i personally prefer clothes from the junior section because i genuinely like the style. i still love going shopping at stores like rue 21, forever 21, hot topic, and more. but i’m starting to wonder if i’m getting too old for these things. i’m skinny and i look younger than my age, and i’m short. so i think these styles still look great on me and i really don’t wanna stop dressing in certain styles unless i naturally grow out of it. but in my words i like to look “fly af” lol. i’ve also never really had a job because of bad anxiety/social anxiety and yeah i know i’m gonna have to get one soon. another thing is that i always picked up on things slow. i’m such a slow learner at things i’m not genuinely interested in and it’s embarrassing and i’m so terrified that i’m always gonna have to ask for help or it will get me fired because i just can’t learn fast enough. my grades in school weren’t always good because i wasn’t interested in most of the subjects and learning was so hard for me. i often slacked and got behind a lot too. not in everything but quite a bit. i wasn’t like completely flunking or anything but trust me it wasn’t that good. and because of my anxiety on top of being a slow learner just makes it so hard to want to get a job. and one more thing is that having older parents doesn’t help, it’s another big reason i don’t wanna grow up or get older. my mom is gonna be 62 this year and my dad 61. my parents will already be in their early 80s when i’ll just be barely pushing 40, like in my late 30s still. the thought of that eats at me everyday and it just worst. i just want to time to stop. i don’t wanna see them get older and older and weaker while i’m still pretty young, i can’t handle it. i love them so much, but i just can’t help but wish they had me a few years sooner. i’m gonna make sure that they take care of their health, watch their diet, take care of their skin and get enough exercise and rest. does anyone feel like this?",70,183,Growing up is terrifying and I also feel like I’m getting old when I probably shouldn’t,Adult
5049,"lately i’ve been struggling with feeling stressed that there always seems to be something to do and it feels i have very little time for myself. i’m not talking about things like working, commuting, groceries or other parts of basic adulthood like that. what i mean is, there always seems to be someone to please or somewhere else to go or expectations of what i “should” be doing that end up filling my planner and stressing me out. for example, one of my goals for 2020 is to not spend as carelessly and keep a better eye on my “fun money.” but already, two separate groups of friends want to plan gatherings that involve going to restaurants and having a meal. i feel like i can’t say no because if i say no, i risk not getting anymore invites and not having a social life. but i also hate that already i have to shell out for restaurant meals that are not particularly cheap. so i feel like i have to say yes and spend the money to have friendships. even inviting people to my apartment feels stressful. my mom told me that she feels there is no reason i can’t have my good friend over for a movie and “(you) can just go buy a cheesecake and let her come over to watch a movie.” i only have a one bedroom apartment and not much inclination to feel like i have to play hostess, even if it’s only for one friend. plus i still have to buy the food for guests or make a small meal. my extended family also wants to come over at some point and see the place and it stresses me out. the last time my mom was here, she was attempting to rearrange my decorations. i fear my other family members coming in and trying to do the same, or making suggestions when i just want to do things in my apartment the way i want. i feel like i will never be on track with my money goals if everyone else just expects me to spend and thinks i should entertain guests. i don’t live in a huge city so there’s not tons of free options around me. i kind of want to have money for my own fun too and have some sort of buffer for “just in case.”",5,1,How can I cope with something always coming up that involves spending money?,Adult

5487,"there's a lot that goes into this, and i (f 19) really just don't know what to do any more. a tragic family event happened last year that left me basically homeless and with some pretty severe ptsd. i missed my last week of high school, my two graduations, my summer job, lost out on the opportunity of going to college, and probably the biggest hitter was i lost my grandpa who was a father figure to me for 15 years of my life, and my cousin both at the same time. everything would of been okay if i didn't get kicked out by my abusive grandmother (grandfather's wife) who had custody of me. (event happened 5-10-2018 - got kicked out after i turned 18 on the 12th of may). my gf let me move in with her a few weeks later, but she was still living with her parents. between grieving my grandfather, losing everything, the trauma, and my whole life falling apart i fell into one of the worst depressions i've ever been in. 3 months later and my state getting worse i ended things with her, packed a few trashbags and bounced from place to place. my grandmother opened her house back up to me but i wasn't able to handle the abusive tendencies coming back, so i gathered my stuff up once more after reaching out to the only person i really had left.in november of 2018 my brother (21) offered me a place to stay in pennsylvania which was where i was born and was put into foster care before i got placed in ohio. with options short i took the chance packed up my car and took the 9 hour drive from ohio to his house in pa. i arrived 2 days before thanksgiving. i instantly was wondering if i made the right choice. it was a small studio apartment (him and his gf lived in). not clean, mouse crap everywhere, just not a clean and healthy place, also in a very very bad area crime rate wise. keep in mind i lived in a small farming town and i moved to an area with a county population of 1.1 million. while i tried to relax and keep in mind i can build myself up and make a home for myself if i work hard small things started showing through.i started talking to a guy on tinder and we hit it off, he was sweet and we had a lot of good times together. i don't like saying we got serious fast, but we got serious fast. within 3 weeks i was staying at his house and his moms house more than i was at my brothers apartment. this started causing issues between my brother and i. i figured out he was back on cocaine and lost his job, and his license. i gave him over $1500 because they were about to lost the apartment which i still haven't seen a penny back of after momths and months of different plans. tensions were constantly on the rise and it ended up to the point where i was only there once a week. i packed my shit up once more and left and moved in with my bf and his mom temporarily. about 3 weeks later after getting a job and his mom agreeing to be a co-signer i got my first studio apartment at the end of march.i was thrilled. even though i needed a cosigner i was self completely self sufficient and i have a home for the next year, things started to really look up, i was genuinely happy.fast forward to a few weeks ago. things are taking a turn for the worst again. my brother is severely addicted again. got held at gunpoint and called me right after. i can't get how shakey his voice was out of my head, (which is screwing with my ptsd and nightmares) and is actively destroying his relationship and it's falling back on me. they're asking for month long stays which i can't risk because their names aren't on the lease. out of pure frustration i went off on my brother. nothing crazy was said, just that i was at a loss and with everything going on i can't mentally handle everything as bad as i felt.. and i blocked him. he sent me a text (one thing i forgot to block him on) essentially telling me ""wish i never bought you out here"" telling me that if anything happens to my ""fa**ot worthless boyfriend not to come crawling back"" because i spit in his face and i'm the most inconsiderate heartless person he's ever met.i'm working 40 hrs full time a week as an it contractor with no option for over time and people keep getting cut off left and right and i have no idea if i'm next. i've been applying to places with no word back except one job that would leave me off worse. i live paycheck to paycheck and have virtually no money to fall back on. i just got food poisoning or something last week.. but it turned into some insane chest pains and tightness the next day. it felt like i was being stabbed in the chest and i could barely get a 3rd of a normal breath in. i had no insurance and thought i was completely out of luck i kept getting turned away. my boyfriend's mom took me to a charity er and after an ecg, chest xray, blood tests, and other lab tests everything came back fine and they told me it's just anxiety. they offered me a shot for it but i turned it down, i just wanted to go home and sleep. i've had major depressive episodes and a history of mental health issues but never really thought it was that bad. i need to get back into therapy but with no insurance it's making it impossible. i contacted the children and youth for the county i was a foster kid through (i live in the county next to it currently) but no one is returning my calls, and i can't miss work but my work hours are the only days they are open. i figured they would be able to give me guidance or help me out because i should qualify for some sort of state insurance or assistance or something. so that's one thing on my plate right now, this large bill i'm going to have if i can't get this figured out.my boyfriend is going to college over 3 hours away mid august, and that is also starting to really hit me. i got attached very fast which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but i have 0 friends. i know absolutely no one in this area or know how to go about making friends in ways that doesn't cost.. again i'm broke. i'm already struggling with the idea of not having him around that much any more.. he's really been my rock the past 7 months. i cannot give that man enough credit for all he has done for me. i've never loved anyone as much as i love him. i try to keep in mind he has friends and a social life and is trying to get time in with his friends and family and work before he goes but i'm very lonely and very worried about how i'm going to handle not having him around.. or if him and i will even be able to keep this relationship going and healthy with him being so far away. that, and the fact that when he goes to college i have

5622,"i was raised in a cultural background where eye contact wasn't expressly encouraged, but it's **essential** to being a functional social being in most of the world. these are tips to people who might have trouble with eye contact, for whatever reason. 1. eye contact lets you read social cues. the face expresses the most ""body"" language. you have to be looking at the person to get that moment to moment feedback (they're looking bored? pinch it off. they look interested? keep talking.) staring isn't good, but you won't *stare* at someone you're talking to if you pay attention to *their* gaze. there are natural breaks in conversation where people will look away from each other, or look at something else. 2. eye contact lets the other person know you're paying attention. it's pretty uncomfortable to talk to someone you know is listening, but doesn't look at you. like a disinterested server who's buried into their notepad while taking a small order. or a customer who doesn't once look up from their menu. eye contact, on a base level, communicates, ""i acknowledge you exist, and you're saying something"".3. you need it to foster relationships with people. you'll never really get to know someone unless you understand what they're expressing to you. you can't have mutual empathy and compassion if you don't look at someone, and vice versa (it's the reason people won't look at each other when they're mad, they're refusing empathy). conversations and relationships in general feel more rewarding when you can make good eye contact with the other person.hopefully this helps someone avoid coming off as avoidant or antisocial when they don't mean to be (i.e. me sometimes).",27,168,Make eye contact with people while you talk to them,Adult

5768,"26, recent college grad, living in california, usa. have been unemployed 3 months since i moved in with my partner and one of my parents. i graduated in december in a field related to linguistics (called language studies, which is like sociolinguistics + ling foundational stuff + cultural studies in a particular regional concentration.) basically, we moved after being priced out of our college town, and there were hardly any full-time opportunities locally, let alone any that paid enough to live on. my work experience involves a couple random internships in disparate fields. mostly i've held jobs in retail and as a caregiver over the past few years. i'm having a few issues with job searching. first and foremost, i have no idea what the hell keywords i should be using. i am aspergers and in part i chalk up my inability to think outside the box to asperger's. it seems like if only i knew what to search for i could find a job that i could at least grow with or lend my skills to.secondly, my mom has me convinced that if i take just any job^tm then i'm dooming my chances to find a career, let alone something in my field. i had an interview with starbucks for a barista position and it's dumb, but when i got a call back from them i was too scared to return their call. it's been a couple days. a corollary to (2) perhaps, i seem to keep getting pigeonholed for sales associate positions when people see my resume. i do but don't understand it... is this typical for people who had to work jobs like that to survive during college?the way i see it, i have a number of diverse skills, have medical needs and need a job that is either full-time with benefits or pays me enough so that aca doesn't bankrupt me each month. i would love to have a career that is in or adjacent to linguistics, but what's happening now is i find myself desperately applying for teller jobs at banks; or to be a receptionist in a doctor's office; or jobs like the barista position i mentioned because i'm desperate not to continually be asking my mother for financial assistance. in addition, i have something like $15k or so in student loans. not terrible, but my 6-month grace period ends in june, and i'm terrified i'll be just as jobless and just as depressed and anxious and socially withdrawn as i am now. it feels like all the job openings i've been looking at make me gag or have no upward mobility, or otherwise are in fields that i have no business working in and make me feel so very out of my depth. the more i search for jobs and apply to positions that don't feel or look right, the more i'm feeling hopeless, disgusted with myself, and depressed. the whole thing with my family's ""career advice"" has created a perfect storm of anxiety and not being sure what to believe. i've applied to probably hundreds of openings by now and receiving very few calls back. my bank account is overdrawn, i have unpaid bills i need to pay, and i hate asking my parents for financial help. i feel like i'm drowning. i have no idea where to start. my partner is much in the same boat i am, minus having an overdrawn bank account or unpaid bills. i've never lived as an adult in my location, and so i'm feeling socially isolated, too. i feel worthless, helpless, and lost.how do i even begin to recover?",40,63,How the F do I find a career?...Feeling really lost.,Adult

6786,"another year comes to an end and we move another year closer to death. its rather amusing, the concept of death lurking around any unspecific ordinary situation, the most consistent thing about this year has been the inconsistency that it had brought along. most of us entered (subjective to my social circle) 2020, with an amazing spark and outlook towards life. i personally progressed so much last year, that it made a world of difference to my personality and holistically to my existence. i took a leap of progress in terms of getting over the fear of commitment, academic fluency, the equilibrium between the flexibility and rigidity of my stance in different situations that i land myself into. yes, being accountable for my mistakes due to poor reasoning and choices has also come to an acknowledgment. coming from a close knitted nuclear family, it is extremely hard for me to make choices on my own which concerns my interest without upsetting or overlooking anybody’s feelings and requirements. this makes a cocoon of safety but at the same time, it creates a permanent and a hard to break out structure that does not allow me to afford taking small decisions about my life such as making impromptu trips with friends, taking a break from socializing for mental well-being, asking for privacy and staying out after 10.  following that context, i seemed to have finally came out of that cocoon because i moved to another state for college, rented my own flat and managed my monthly expenses; all of this gave me a little taste of liberty which was never experienced.my own room with no-one to knock on, with a door which can be latched, my own time for meals, my choice of meals, random night-outs, late-long night drives around through the quietest time of one of the busiest cities in the country i.e., new delhi.  sure, yes, living on coffee and consuming untimed meals does not really depict an ideal individual behavior, but i personally believe that on a journey of finding oneself, getting lost is an essential milestone. i started liking myself for the person i was becoming, i managed my own finances, i dealt with tight situations myself, i made my own decisions, and i was accountable for them. i guess i could ponder on this later xd.this random piece of text is an attempt to look around the events of 2020 and my observation of people over the internet. after we were forced to head back home from our colleges and jobs towards our hometown. it felt safe and sound because of all the chaos and death going around in the world; people were cherishing this lovely period as their best friends were in town and i think its safe to assume that it was the golden period of this year because of all the family members being present again under the same roof. then came the time where time stood still, everyone had heard all the crazy stories about everyone, there was no gossip left to forward, no celebrity breakups and no-good news from anywhere. what kept us sane was the internet- instagram, facebook, youtube and for those who could afford it- drugs, alcohol, and video games. you know how they say that everything is temporary? every drug has its effect limited to a time frame, then comes the downer and then sobriety hits home. people pursued old interests, picked up new hobbies, learnt instruments, dance etc. but humans being humans, they got tired of it and end of the day, everything remains bland and grey.what happened to the most energetic section of all the population demographic? the students eh? millions of them did not get a farewell, did not get to say goodbye to their best friends, and did not graduate. instead, they got their degrees through e-mails and whatsapp, universities shifting their lifelike boring classes to a screen making the education totally useless. i mean no disrespect to the teachers but if both the teachers and the students were asked the question of “how much were you able to actually teach /learn and how much of it do you think is effective/applicable in real life?”, my assumption could be wrong, but the assumption is a simple no, no we have not learnt shit, we do not like schools/colleges on computers and mobile phones but i guess itttiisswutitizzz.let us come back to the question of what happened to people, to enjoy the littlest moments in life, they have started measuring how big of a little moment they are having and how is it better than the person they meet every now and then. the question of who has more money and drip has become more important than who might need help or who might be the person on the verge of a breakdown. people follow these trends on tiktok and instagram where they must do weird shit to their bodies, dance on music they do not know the words to, swear in front of their respected individuals, lie about their mental well-being to seem edgy, act politically woke without studying an ounce of facts and so much more. i understand that people find pleasure in the littlest of things and moments but let us understand something together okay?we are living in an era where social validation has become more valuable than any currency in the forex market, it is something that an individual of every race, gender and age is feeding upon without any boundaries to content and risk of tremendous hatred hidden behind the curtains of anonymity. this trend culture has made people sell different parts of themselves to a mass of people who are there on the internet to consume media but are so fragile when it comes to content selection that if they do not like your voice, hair, eyebrows or even your size of nose, they will skip ahead. every alternate video is the same repetition of a joke revolving around one ancient subject… yeah you guessed it- sex! okay buddy, big deal, you have a huge penis, okay you have a small one, size does not matter, boobs are funny, cleavage is scandalous, you cheated on your significant other and that is cool because you are pretty and that does not make you any less of a good person because #fucknegativity.  people have become mean; they will not help another person if the other person does not have a favor they can return later.  now let’s come to what happened to music, let me be short with this one an quote some examples here:-real hot girl shitah(and if the beat live, you know lil ju made it)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odyody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (mwah)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody (ah, ah, ah ah)ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odybody crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (yeah, yeah, yeah)body crazy, curvy, wavy, big titties, lil' waist (mwah)body-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-odyody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody-ody\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------i tell a nigga don't dick ride, don't blick rideleave it to the double thick thighs, twin sistersdrop it down and wobble, wobble up, mami booted upshe get down and gobble, gobble up 'cause my money upslide, slide in the bentley truck-a, the wraith truck-ayour bestie is a dick sucker, i big dub heras-salama-lama alaykum, you big hateryou nothin' but a hater, hater, clout chaser\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you fucking with some wet-ass pussybring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussygive me everything you got for this wet-ass pussyhonestly, what the fuck happened back there?

7458,"hello reddit,i'm a barely 20 year old who has no idea what the fuck he's doing. long story short, halfway through my childhood it everything got twist turned upside down and i've barely left my house since, have no local friends, and parents are a bust. on top of that i've got both physical and mental disorders that i've lived with my whole life, which don't help. but i don't want to live in a puddle of self pity and blame anymore, so i'm trying to figure shit out. thing is though, who would have thought that opting out of society and not talking to nearly anybody for 8 years would make it very hard to opt back in to society. wild concept, i know. i just don't know where to start, which is why i'm coming here hoping to know where to start.while i live with my parents, they're the sort of people you'd see talked about on /r/raisedbynarcissists or /r/justnofamily . so going to them for help is like going to a combo anvil-and-rope shop for pool floaties. my main goal is to get out of here as soon as i can, which i'm working on by trying to find a job. it's not going too well, but i have hope.i can't think of the best way to ask all of my questions, so i'll just list what i can think of. any replies will be read and appreciated.list of things i need help figuring out:- how to not be a social failure. i'm probably autistic (and i mean this legitimately, my family has a long history of it but i can't see a doctor to talk to anyone about it as of right now), and have major social anxiety. turns out that not talking to anyone for years can undo any social skills that i'd managed to develop! when i do manage to go out and about, my social skills can be summed up of replying with vague ""mhm"" ""yeah"" ""uh huh"" and nods and bows i can barely convey without panicking. despite this, i often somehow manage to say something that a few hours after i've said it i replay the conversation in my head and realize i've said something that in the situation was rude and lose sleep over it.- how to land a job. i have no valuable skills and dropped out of school, and eventually persuaded to not return. it's too late for me to go back to high school now, and i can't afford to get my ged right now (no money to travel / means of travel + test prices). this means no one wants to hire me, because they assume i'm illiterate and can't do a good job. i've applied at so many places; at fast food joints, supermarkets, general stores, etc. they either instantly send a rejection letter when they've been hiring for months / always short staffed (looking at you target) or don't either bother sending a rejection letter at all. i don't care what i do at this point, i just need to land something. anything. - how taxes and bills and money management works. i know **how** to save money (via literally just not spending it), but i know nothing about how to budget, how taxes would work, basically anything related to money.- questions to ask when touring / applying to an apartment so that you don't get a horrible deal and to get a better chance of getting your application accepted. there's an apartment complex i've been looking at that after i'd have a job would easily be able to afford. it's nothing super fancy, but it's the best bang for your buck in my area. i wouldn't want to fuck up my chances when the time for me to go apartment hunting arises.and general adulting stuff that i might have missed or not thought of. i'm terrified of having to live with my parents even another year, and i think that if i don't get out of here and end up living with them my whole life i'd genuinely rather die. sorry if this is a lot or a bummer of a post, i'm just scared and want my situation to change for the better. if this post would fit better on a different subreddit or doesn't fit here, please let me know and i'll modify / change it. thank you for your time.",0,1,Socially Inexperienced 20-Something with a Lot of Questions,Adult

8299,"i'm kind of embarrassed writing this, even the anonymity here isn't enough. i'm 26 years old, and i live at home, the same room that i was brought into from the hospital. my nursery, then turned into my room and i've been here all my life and do not see myself moving out any time soon. i've never had a job longer than 1 month. yes, 30 days. i wasn't ever fired from any of them, in fact, a couple of them offered me more money to stay - i just couldn't handle it. i couldn't handle having to talk to strangers, and be around people for long periods of time. i've been in therapy for almost a year now. i've made some progress, but not much. i still cut myself, as in self-harm and still deal with an eating disorder that i refused to get treatment for when it almost killed me at 17. aside from all the mental health stuff, i'm a healthy and smart person. i have no business being as miserable and lazy as i am. i do nothing all day. i'm proud of myself if i do something that's not watching tv, reading or reddit for 15 minutes. i don't exercise either. the worst part? my family sees nothing wrong with this. they've never asked me to get a job and move out. technically, where i live it's not custom to move out before marriage. so that's not weird - but the not even forcing or encouraging me to get a job part is weird. in fact, my parents just offered to pay me even more money. for doing nothing. i'm in grad school, and supposed to be working on my shit... but... well... i asked them to please not give me an allowance, and they refused. they already pay for all my other expenses: ubers, phone bills, internet, all other bills (house). i try my hardest not to ask for money. i work freelance sometimes, but then i don't really have many expenses. i hate that i'm living the same life that a pre-schooler lives. i don't leave the house (even before the whole pandemic), i don't work, i don't socialize, i am comfortable and that terrifies me. at some point, mommy and daddy aren't going to be around to bail me out. i don't wanna be a 40 year old loser who has to learn how to function. i already don't wanna be the 26 y.o loser who doesn't know how to function. i will die if left alone. lol i know the solution- get a job- save up- move out- learn to cook. ok, all great advice, except it's very hard to do when there's no reason to. i almost legitimately once asked my dad to kick me out. i hate being ""x's little girl"". i'm the middle child, and neither one of my siblings were treated like this. honestly, it's kind of insulting - it's not even about being the favorite. they baby me so much. i haven't driven since getting my driver's license because my parents won't let me drive because people drive like lunatics here. i uber or am driven places all the time, and other people pay for it. my brother jokingly calls me ""princess"", but that's how this is... and i'm complaining about it! look at that! i have a great family who loves me too much! but i just feel like i'm not adult enough for the real world. like the world is going to crush me some day, and it'll be too late. i feel like i'm emotionally not mature enough to handle life: my most favorite character on a tv show i like was killed off recently, and i haven't been able to function like a normal person all day. i skipped lunch, i binged on junk food instead, i slept from 2 to 5 pm, i've been angry and bitching about it to everyone... what is wrong with me? why am i 12?",45,1,"I am truly ashamed of the person I am today: an adult on the outside, but I live the life of a bratty spoiled teenager",Adult

(the apartment is in a building wiht its own rooftop so no one would be walking through the apartment.)honestly, all of these women are great, but i have more in common with the second one. so my basic question is this: do i live with someone more similar to me, or do i live with two people who are a little bit different and would push me outside my comfort zone?any feedback y'all have from your own experiences would be great.",2,1,Should you live with someone similar or different from you?,Adult

8784,"i'm a big philosopher as a thinker, to begin with, and i'm guessing you know some introvert that can tell you that it is a double-edged sword (i get it from my parents).  i have deconstructed plenty things before, like putting up with someone, or handling social situations, for example, and there's an initial stage where it gives you more security in dealing with whatever thing gets you distracted or insecure or whatever, but then when you don't have friends to really talk about it to, your mind can get tunnel vision and take it too far, or rely on it too much, and re-wire your brain in a way you never intended.  what i mean by this is something louis ck said in a routine, ""here's how my brain works: its stupidity, followed by self-hatred, and then further analysis.  it's not a very efficient system of thought""but i want to talk about something frustrating to me... sexual fantasies and how they get irreparably ruined very easily.  when i was a 19 yr old living at home like most millennials, i, of course, explored masturbation in my room, not that i started at 19... that'd be late, right??.. nevermind.  what else are you going to do when you are seeing young girls my age everywhere but don't have any means to impress them with.  not to say i was lonely or friendless, and i held a job and also went to the gym, but just saying masturbation was very necessary back then.  there was a girl at my part-time job that generated a lot of fantasies for me in my special time, and this was pre-internet porn for me (not to say i'm middle-aged, or morman or anything.  we still had mid-2000s dial-up. its a post for another time of all worries of my damages cause i got to the internet later than my peers).  but eventually, after working alone with her for 2-3 shifts a week, we became friends, and while i still think she was one of the most attractive people i've met in real life..she was a cameron diaz looking girl who had brothers and liked to joke around.. i guess the friendship made me stop thinking about her in ""that way"" when alone.  but you really never stop being attracted to girls with a personality you like too... but i had a few sports illustrated swimsuit issues and would steal my neighbor's victoria's secret brochures with all those models- and of course some dvd of comedies with some gratuitous young hot girl who is only in the movie for the nude scene (caddyshack, american pie, etc).  it was an innocent time.. anyway, i'll continue.  it was at 19 when i was in my 3rd semester of community college, was not sure of my major anymore with growing pressure from my parents.  i was having a more balanced social life than i had ever had in high school, likely from observational learning from that friend at work; she was introverted too.  in retrospect, my connection with masturbation changed.  it was less about feeding my ego, and more just my routine to take a break from my stress.   and that's the confidence i was talking about that is, the pride before the fall.   don't worry ladies, you're perspective on that will be addressed. if any girls are still reading this,  i know that for decades or centuries married women have given men routine sex as a reward for good habits, or security, or to 'keep the marriage healthy"" but most don't climax every time.  but also reminding you that this is coming from a male's perspective and i may put two words like 'radical' and 'feminists' together later. actually, if you think i was a 19 yr old who would put american pie, old school, or caddyshack on pause makes me as complicit as the weinstein company, just slooow your roll for one second. that being said, of course, like everyone i have embarrassments from my youth.  maybe i jumped too far, and you wouldn't of thought of it until now but it kinda goes to show the kind of fear i live in today. but this community is about non-judgment, right?  i'm posting all this anonymously on the internet because everything here is just something i can't talk about to anyone irl.what was this about?? the dangers of re-wiring my brain so that i'm not myself anymore.. yea.i started wondering what was it about all those models in bathing suits that made me sweat without even thinking as a 19 yr old.  and since, i've matured and learned that an orgasm is basically the same brain reaction for a man or woman, and, for straight women, the path to get there is completely different. i still cannot fathom if it's not visual for you... you can't possibly be thinking of a guy's sense of humor while you masturbate if our orgasms are the same.  so it must be his smile, his height, his haircut, or a physical act you've seen or can imagine him doing.  all of those are strong indications he's a healthy person so masturbatory thoughts about it are pretty healthy.  all that plays almost no part in a male thought.  well, at least speaking for sex fantasies... but height and muscles are best-case non-motivating, worst case turn-offs.  and anyway, in conclusion, i want to say that the advancement of the last 10-15 yrs where girls are saying they want to wear make-up for their own reasons, and that if she wants to wear yoga pants she can and guys are supposed to be more evolved than to leer or gaze is all really confusing.  hormones are real.  i can understand a little concealer but why are you wearing so much!?  what about a thong is comfortable or empowering?? i'm committed in my life enough to give up porn or added sugar in search of a clear mind and happy life but if a pretty girl is around i've gotta have a look.  why am i posting this in adulting?

(1) sleep deprivation. you will feel the ill-effects of sleep deprivation long before you are falling asleep in class/the library or finding it impossible to get up for your early classes. you will lose focus, become more irritable, and more susceptible to depression and anxiety. spoil yourself with sleep above all other things, even studying sometimes, because it's an investment in the rest of your semester not falling apart.(2) having good nutrition doesn't just mean survive on food other than sugared cereal and ramen. if you can cook for yourself, foods like eggs (scrabled, boiled, whatever) and lentil soup are easy to make and super cheap. try to eat a few servings of fruits and vegetables every day - even if it's a disappointing apple from the cafeteria. carrots are also cheap, peel them and just eat them as a snack, you can dip them in peanut butter or hummus (cheap and easy to make with garlic, canned chickpeas, tahini, and a bit of lemon).(3) lack of privacy is the hardest one to pin down. but with dorm or group house living, it can be hard to keep other people out of your room either physically or just with the disruption of their voices. find quiet places and times to work and train yourself to work well there. plenty of students say, truthfully, that they can't study in the library because it's too quiet. it's just a new habit to get into. even studying in a coffee shop is a better option, because it's more like white noise from people you don't know.",17,8,"LPT: The 3 hidden thieves of productivity in college are sleep-deprivation, poor nutrition, and lack of privacy.

2924,"2020 was tough. like many other people, i need a do-over badly. i've decided to do some planning.  when setting goals and creating life plans, the ""how"" we do it is just as important as the ""why"" we do it. 8/10 people who make new years resolutions fail within a few weeks. i think many of us think about how to accomplish goals in life. many of us think about how to accomplish dreams. however, how many of us actually sit down, write it out, and put in the dedicated time on paper? something that reminds us every day of what we want and where we want to go? so, i've come up with a life blueprint.# [what is a life blueprint?](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/)a life blueprint is similar to a blueprint that an architect uses to showcase detailed plans for a building or a house. only this blueprint has detailed plans for all areas of your life. things such as your **career,** your **health**, your **relationships**, your **hobbies**. you plan your vision. you plan your purpose. it's an outline of everything so that you can make your life a truly great one. goal planning and planning for your life should be written down, thought about, revised, and then revised again. always referring back to it. goals in life don't just happen. we have to take inspired action towards our dream life ## [what is the purpose of a life blueprint?](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/) the purpose of a life blueprint is to plan, manage, and get focused on our life goals. the purpose is to figure out all the different areas of your life that are important to you, prioritize them, and then break them down into smaller chunks. when we can break different subjects and life categories down into smaller pieces, it's better for clarity. it allows you to focus on your life plans with greater ease. ## [how do i figure out my life plans?](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/)the way you start figuring out your life plans are to use mechanisms that get you organized. a mechanism that forces your mind to think carefully and creatively. something that stimulates your senses and empowers your subconscious mind. when you empower your subconscious mind, this allows your life plans to become more realistic. our subconscious mind is considered the ""feeling"" part of the brain, as opposed to the conscious mind which is considered the ""thinking"" part of the brain. feeling and thinking can both be measured by science, and studies have confirmed that the electromagnetic field of feeling is stronger than the electromagnetic field of thinking. how often do you forget the small details of your life? everyday right? however, it's always easy to remember how something made you feel. how someone hurt you? how someone or something made you feel? etc. so, we need to feel and plan our life blueprint. the more attention you give to creating a blueprint for your life, the more likely it will become. ## [how do you plan for your life?](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/)to create a plan for your life goals, you want to start by breaking it down into life categories. these categories should cover the full range of the human condition. everything from mindset to emotions, happiness, business, and more. ## 10 life goal categories## [1) money &amp; career goals](https://www.life20movement.com/post/passive-income-vs-earned-income-financial-tips)## [2) mission &amp; purpose goals](https://www.life20movement.com/post/how-do-i-find-my-purpose)## [3) personal goals](https://youtu.be/mkbg5cikxn4)## [4) physical health goals](https://www.life20movement.com/life-2-0-total-body-transformation)## [5) social goals](https://youtu.be/didavbch3du)## [6) mental health goals](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4evmkn6n5hxnoien2kuyif)## [7) family goals](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/#/sc-checkout)## [8) relationship goals](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/#/sc-checkout)## [9) fun &amp; adventure goals](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/#/sc-checkout)## [10) spiritual goals](https://livebetter.samcart.com/products/my-life-20-blueprint/#/sc-checkout)## what is a good life plan?a good life plan is well rounded, covering all areas of your life. not just one or the other. if you focus only on making money, you can miss out on finding love and starting a family, robbing you of much happiness. if you focus only on your physical goals, but not career or money, you may live a poor life, robbing you of much of your happiness daily. planning your life covers all of these areas equally so that you have a good balance and high quality of life. ## how do i create a successful life plan?to be successful in your life planning, you must make your dreams and goals specific, and measurable. vague goals will create vague outcomes. this is one of the biggest reasons people don't accomplish goals.also, in life we must be focusing on the positives instead of the negatives. having a bad attitude or doubting your self confidence will ruin your life plans. believe in yourself. believe in your dreams. this is how you create success. this is how you create a blueprint for your life. hope this helped or inspired someone today. al the best.",8,1,"LPT: When planning your 2021 goals, you have to do more than think about them.

(happened to me, got much better now!) i received a blank din a5 rocketbook by my gf this christmas and i basically split every page in two parts. at the very top of every day in my agenda i write the day of the week, the date and special occurrences (birthdays, festivities, anniversaries etc.). this can save your a** and help you buy gifts, write cards etc. in time! then i proceed to write a category (fitness, health, studying, work etc.) and the related task (send assignment for the date it's due, work on assignment the days before, doctor appointment with time etc.)it is important to make it like a to-do or checklist. ticking off those boxes everyday can make you feel productive, worthy of some well-earned leisure and boost your self-esteem, knowing that you have done at least something, rather than completely nothing. knowing that something should be done that day rather than the day after will make you do it, because after some time, if you move those avoided task to other days, you are going to clearly see how they cumulate. this was a really big positive thing for me, because i realized that these tasks subconsciously cumulated in my head as i didn't use an agenda, making me relatively stressed and unhappy, also feeling like i didn't deserve to get some free time and just play videogames etc. basically, not seeing the result of my productivity always put a big question mark on it, making me feel like i don't do enough. the only difficult part really is that you have to make it a habit to open it everyday you get into public transport, you sit at your desk, or any time you can actually read and write into it. i usually used to leave it on my desk everyday, so that it's the first thing i see everyday. now i automatically get it, even if it's not in my viewing field. i have been using agendas on and off for the last 5 years and if there is one big thing i noticed, is that the periods of time when i used one were the most productive and satisfying ones. i am not a routine lover and oftentimes procrastinate, because i am confident that the last-day stress before an assignment etc. will eventually drag me through it.

7487,"i am a deliver driver for a company that rhymes with smamaton. now some of these tips may sound like they break the rule against posting common sense tips, but as i have found in life, common sense is not very common. first tip. walk outside and see if you can quickly find and read your address. if you can’t, neither can i. did you hang a nice big beautiful wreath from that light next to the garage door? is that wreath now covering up the house number? or are you in an apartment and you hung a wreath on your door and your apartment number is now covered?finding addresses is probably my biggest waste of time. now you may say that all i need to do is see if i can read the neighbors address then i should know your address right. except that every neighborhood is different in how the numbers increase. some increase by 2, some by 4, some by 10 and even some by 20 or 50. so knowing your neighbors address doesn’t help me unless i go to your other neighbors house and see what his number is. and now i am just wasting a lot of time walking around when it would be so much easier to just have nice big visible numbers in an obvious location. here is a link to an [imgur folder](https://m.imgur.com/a/f441pmy) i put together of some of my most recent pain in the ass addresses. don’t be these people. second tip. us drivers hate porch pirates as much as you do. we do not want your stuff to get stolen. please do us a favor and put something on your porch that i can hide your package behind. big potted plants or even those big plank signs that say welcome on them work great to hide stuff behind. lately i have even seen folks buying those big plastic tubs to have their packages put in. now they obviously aren’t secure but it will lesson the chances of pirates checking out the tub just to see if something is in there. they are more interested in going for a sure thing where the big package is right there for them to see. the company i drive for also has a new delivery option where we can use our work tablet to open your garage door. to be honest, every time i do these deliveries i get worried that the homeowner will forget he had a package coming or forget that he is using this delivery option and he is going to come running into his garage blasting. but i do like the fact that it insures your stuff won’t get stolen. i have never done one of those deliveries inside a house and frankly i really don’t want to. the idea of doing it just kind of freaks me out. third tipif you have a ring door bell or something similar, please check it occasionally to make sure it works. you might need to clean the camera lens or reposition it. i have been stopped a few times by customers asking me about a package that was supposed to be delivered but is missing. (we are running 2 shifts a day and multiple drivers may end up in the same neighborhood and we don’t always deliver to the same neighborhood every day so it is a good chance it wasn’t me that delivered it) i always ask them if they have a video doorbell and most of the time i am told something about how the video looks fuzzy or is aimed in the wrong direction. it only takes a minute. double check it. fourth tipi love dogs. i keep a pocket full of milk bones to give out to all of the good pups out there. (and yes i even have a ziplock bag full of cat treats for the cats i see) when i walk up to the door and i hear a dog just giving me the “who are you” bark, i always leave a milk bone to let them know they are doing a good job. but sometimes i walk up and damn cujo is frothing at the mouth and biting at the glass next to the door, trying his hardest to break the glass so he can kill me. i don’t like those dogs. but these dogs aren’t really a problem as they can’t get to me. the real problem is when i have to head out to some farm house like today and they had 5 dogs just running around. i spent a good 5 minutes sitting in my van with side door open just talking to the dogs and tossing them milk bones. i finally thought i had them cool with me so i started walking towards the house. when i got to about 15 feet from the house, it was like someone flipped a switch and everyone started barking and growling. one then started barking and lunging towards me. fuck that. i backed up into my van, then backed the van up to the start of the driveway, tossed the package out the window, took a picture and left. my other option is to call or text you to find out what to do but you pissed me off by having mean dogs. it is not their fault, it is yours for raising them like that. so i hope they ate your package. so if you choose to have dogs roam your property with no socialization skills, then please put out a box or something that i can put stuff into with out getting eaten. final quick tipwhen you place an order with us, you have the option to add a note to the delivery. if you don’t want me to knock or ring your doorbell, put that in there. if you want the package put in a certain spot like the side of the house or behind a certain bush, put it in there. in addition, if you have put some old directions in there, double check that it is still current. i have been to this one house several times and the instructions are asking me to make sure their package gets delivered today because it is a costume and they are going to a halloween party that night. i first saw this back in august so it is over a year old. not a tip but a thank you. thank you to all of you who put out little baskets of treats for us. it is greatly appreciated. this isn’t a hard job really but it can be physically exhausting. and coming up to a house and getting a candy bar or a gatorade makes the day go by a little faster. so thank you.",340,1,"LPT: As the last week of Christmas deliveries are going to be heading out, here are some tips from your friendly neighborhood delivery driver on how to make things go faster and smoother.",Adult

7613,"over the years i had one friend group after high school. it was nice having a social circle and whatnot but of course not everything is nice and dandy. that’s okay, friends go through shit.however if it’s 10 years down the line and you gotta mentally prepare yourself before joining that discord call, or going over to hang out.. then you better start taking action before it builds up and explodes in your face. talking from personal experience i had one specific friend who would make my life a living hell whenever we were in the group. berated me, judged me on basically how i played any game, cruel and mean jokes that if he got no reaction would be pissed off and if he got one would say to calm down and it’s only a joke. i was able to identify what was making me feel like shit and not wanting to join my other friends, that guy. what can you do though since they are too cemented in the friend group. depending on your friends you could talk to them about it and come up with a solution. however if you have the friends like i did then it’s better to just ditch the group and let time heal those mental wounds. to clarify i did go face to face about that friend many times before but it just reset the vicious abuse cycle and it was getting tiresome on giving him a 5th chance. mentioned it to another friend and boom, he started shit and made the friend group basically implode. i found out the hard way that i was just with a toxic group of friends and the best option for my mental health was to just leave. if you find yourself in a similar situation don’t just sit there and let it happen for too long, take action but think before you leap. your mental health is number 1, better friends will show up eventually.",3,1,"LPT: If you find yourself mentally exhausted or finding it to be a chore to hang out with your friend group, it’s time to either identify the problem and fix it, or find a less toxic friend group.",Adult

8149,"since the new year is approaching, i figured i'd create a challenge for you all!i'm already in a very similar process at the moment (i post a progress post on my profile every day if you want to check it out). the reason i say this is to say that the purpose of this post is simply to give you all some ideas on ways you can improve yourselves in 2021. the power of incremental improvement is amazing.**january: setting a wake-up time*** the four pillars of health are sleep, fitness, healthy eating, and having a good social life. let's work on fixing your sleep first. before focusing on a consistent sleep-time, it is key to work on waking up at the same time every day. you get to pick a time, but make sure that it is relatively early. 8 am is an excellent choice, for example.**february: setting up a seep time*** now that you are consistently waking up at the same time every day, you might have noticed that you might be tired some days. this is because your sleep time might not be consistent. 8 hours of sleep is a good target, but if you feel that it is too much or too little you can change it. your goal here is to be in bed at the same time every night. it might help to also set a time for when you need to get ready for bed. a night routine might take time and shouldn't be rushed.**march: performing deep work*** now that your sleep is fixed, you might notice that you have plenty of extra time during the day. you will use this time to indulge in at least 1 hour of deep work per day. deep work is defined as an activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. writing, studying, and coding are some examples. you can also spend your time producing your own content. the book ""deep work"" talks in detail about deep work, and the difference between deep work and shallow work.**april: hitting the gym*** now that your sleep is fixed and you're working on your brain muscles, it's time to start working on your actual muscles. the goal here is to go to the gym 3-5 days per week and perform strength training. the book ""bigger leaner stronger"" is a great book that talks about this and provides a workout routine. also, don't forget to stretch after your workouts! we don't want you getting injured.**may: doing cardio*** now that you've successfully worked on creating the habit of working on your muscles 3-5 days a week, the next goal is to add cardio into the mix. you can do this after your workouts or you can do it during your rest days. cardio can include running, swimming, hiking or even walking. the goal is to have 2 sessions per week. hiit is also a good example of cardio. a good idea might be to do hiit one day and to do low intensity cardio another day.**june: eating healthy*** wow, look at all your progress. you're going to bed at the same time every night, you're waking up early every day, and you're working on your brain and on your physical muscles. now it's time to focus on what you're putting into your body. you will start eating healthy every day. less carbs, more fruits and vegetables, no deep fried food, no unnatural foods, no unhealthy preservatives, no soft drinks, lots of protein... the list goes on. furthermore, you are to drink at least 2 litters of water per day, as water is also a big part of nutrition. there is a lot of information online about what constitutes as healthy eating. the book mentioned above is a good example. you can still eat food that tastes good. chipotle, for example, tastes amazing. another example is dark chocolate. you can by all means have a couple pieces of dark chocolate with your tea. the more proper research you do, the more you'll understand what is healthy and what isn't. the goal for this month is to implement a healthy lifestyle.**july: taking social risks*** the first three pillars of health have already been talked about. now it's time to do something about your social life. your goal here is to take 1 social ""risk"" per day. this can be something as simple as texting an old friend and asking if they would like to have a phone call to catch up. this can be something like asking a cute girl/guy if they would like to get coffee with you. this can be something like sending an email to an old professor and asking how they've been. this can be something like asking your friends if they'd like to hang out during the weekend and setting up a plan. the goal here is to get busy socially and to get in contact with more people.**august: teeth care*** wow congrats! you are a healthy person now. you are working on strength training and cardio every week. you are eating healthy. you have an amazing sleep schedule. you have an awesome social life. you are performing deep work every day on projects you find interesting. next up, it's time to work on preventing future health problems. the best way to start this is by working on your teeth. the goal here is to brush your teeth properly twice a day and to floss once per day. you can watch videos on youtube if you'd like or you can set up an appointment with your dentist. you are to no longer half-ass your teeth care. i want you to have the cleanest set of teeth out of everyone.**september: skin care*** there is a great subreddit on the topic of skin care on reddit. the three pillars of a beginner routine are to have a good moisturizer, to have a good cleanser and to have a good suncream. you are to go to that subreddit and learn how to create your beginners' routine with those three products. then you are to purchase those products and apply them every day in the manner that is set out in your routine.**october: meditating*** wow look at you! 9 amazing habits so far. you have transformed into a better version of yourself. but you're not done yet. next, we will work on calming your brain by meditating every day. there are some great meditation apps, such as headspace and calm available. the goal is to divide the month into 4 parts. the first week, you do 5 minutes of meditation per day. the second week, 10 minutes. third week, 15 minutes. finally, on the last week of the month you do 20 minutes per day. after the month is over you can return back to doing at least 5 minutes per day moving forward.**november: limiting phone use*** the next goal is to limit instant gratification. we live in a world where we are constantly plugged into the internet and into our smartphones. the best way to tackle this issue is by starting with what that is often most used, and most unhealthy - your smart phone. you are to set a 1 hour limit for each day (unless of course you absolutely need to use it for work or for an emergency or something). the point is to limit the use of apps such as youtube, instagram and things of that nature on the smartphone. you can spend your new time on things like reading or other hobbies.**december: helping people*** look at you! you have become a healthy individual. now it's time to help others! you are to perform one act of ""helping"" per day. this can be something as simple as giving money to a homeless person. you could also go on subreddits that talk about depression and suicide, for example, and direct message a user who is going through a hard time. there are numerous ways we can be kind and help others. your help and kindness must be genuine here. you goal is to take a little bit of time every day to be kind and to help someone.**final thoughts:*** it's amazing how much progress can be made in one year simply by focusing on one habit per month and then by adding a new habit the following month. there are many other habits that i wish i could have fit into this 12-month plan, but i believe these 12 are the most important for people just starting out. there is, however, one habit that needs to be mentioned. this is the habit of taking care of your finances. during the year, when you are focusing on the 12 habits mentioned above, make sure to keep this one in mind. make sure that you are being smart about your purchases and that you are learning about money management, and things like investing and saving. with that being said, i wish you all all the best in this journey!

12914,"even though 2020 was a bit of a write-off, there is more hope in 2021. since it's that time of the year again where a lot of people evaluate their lives and goals again,  i wanted to study why a lot of people seem to lose sight of their goals, become unmotivated, and don't do the things they know would make them happier. i was surprised to find out that 8 out of 10 people who start new year's resolutions give up within the first month!hope this helps someone today or at least intrigues you in some manner.## 1) you don't have a strong enough ""why""one of the biggest reasons people fail is because they simply don't have a ""why"" that they are really attached to. they don't have that deep emotional drive to change something. maybe they haven't quite suffered enough to change. more often than not it's more about vanity and wants, instead of need. a necessity. it has to move from a wish to a must-do. ""i need this to be happier on a daily basis.""## 2) you don't make time to focusgoals or dreams in life only happen when we take action. goals without a plan simply don't work. people spend more time planning vacations or looking at their social media feeds than they do to focus on their goals. they think that because they simply set an intention and thought about what they want, that it was enough. it's not.  you have to keep going into action. for ex: ""tonight i'm going to put a timer on my phone for an hour to evaluate and write what i want from my life.""## 3) you create weak goalsweak goals create weak results. good goals need to be specific and measurable. that means it has an end date, and some sort of figure involved. ""i will 20 pounds in 2 months through healthy cooking and intermittent fasting 5 days a week,"" etc. it's specific and has an end date.## 4) your goals aren't aligned to your purpose or passionthe most successful people in the world almost always have a deep love for what they do. it's known as a ""labor of love.""from tony robbins to elon musk or j.k. rowling. they wake up every day with passion. even if they weren't millionaires or billionaires, they probably would still be doing exactly what they're doing now at some level.## 5) you keep waiting to start your goalsthis is the ultimate procrastinator. you may say:&gt;i'll wait until next month to start. i'm just not ready yet. or, i'll wait until monday to start. then, it's the beginning of the week when i'm really focused and i'm more likely to do it... sure.if you truly want it and you truly value it, you have to just start now. today.you have to take the first step. results beget more results. people often overestimate what they can do in 30 days, let alone a year. just focus on the process of becoming what it is you want to be or do, and forget about the outcome. then you're more likely to become it, rather than simply wishing it unconsciously away all the time.hope this helps! wishing everyone all the best.",8,1,"LPT: If you want to reach your goals, then you need a strong why and make time to focus on it. 8/10 people give up within the first 30 days because of simple reasons like this.",Adult

13328,"if you get into political, social, religious, etc. debates with friends and family, don't do so with the hopes of getting them to completely submit to your point of view. you're likely going to enter the debate hostile and arrogant, it'll hurt your relationship, and no one will be any wiser as a result. no one listens to anyone who acts like a condescending jerk and assumes their opponent has nothing to add. no matter how right you may think you are, if you have an awful attitude, you're just going to make people dislike you unnecessarily.instead, enter the debate with a willingness to learn and an assumption that the other person has something to add, as well as the possibility that you could be wrong about something. there are practical reasons for this i'll explain in a moment.you can do this by:-asking clarifying questions that have no attitude attached (""just so i can make sure i follow, are you saying x, y and z?"") -- this makes sure there are no misunderstandings and shows interest.-do not talk over your opponent and do not let them talk over you. it shows basic respect. if they interrupt, give no attitude. just a quick ""hey, let me finish.""-keep calm, and do not be hostile even if the other person starts slinging unnecessary personal insults. tell them you don't appreciate it and would like to get back on topic. if they don't, walk away.-find something, no matter how small, you can agree with them on. showing common ground facilitates the exchange of ideas.-don't use unnecessary disrespectful language. no ""sheep,"" ""stupid,"" ""brainwashed,"" ""there is nothing valid about your point of view,"" etc. doesn't matter if you think this. you're gonna start a fight and shut them down. no one will listen to you, nor should they if they're being talked to that way.-be warm and keep a friendly posture as much in line with the positive aspects of your relationship with the other person as possible. in most cases you're not talking to your enemy, so don't treat them that way.if you debate with these points in mind and drop the hostility, you're going to open up communication to share ideas. this means that they will be more likely to listen to you because you're showing them respect, and you might actually learn something about/from people who think differently from you (which you can use to refine your perspective and positions). your debate might actually result in a minor or moderate perspective shift on their end if your stance is correct, which is the most you should actually hope for from a vast majority of debates. take ""winning"" out of the equation.the idea of ""i'm going to be a jerk but somehow get them to change their entire worldview by winning the argument"" is not realistic. even if you do somehow ""win,"" it may greatly weaken your relationship.there are always exceptions, of course, but setting this as a baseline will result in much better outcomes for you than you may have had previously.last tip: once you start noticing you're going in circles, acknowledge the lack of progress politely and either move to another subject or start to draw conclusions on the debate that acknowledges both perspectives and touches on a couple new common ground areas. if you can make even a small concession, do that here. i feel like with good communication strategies (which are not lies but just ways to facilitate a more open exchange of ideas), at least a few relationships could avoid being harmed by debates that end up going nowhere. thank you for reading my novel.",6,3,"LPT: Don't debate for total submission.

16364,"this is such an overlooked social skill, which is unfortunately essential. some people are hardwired to out others down to raise themselves up. if you are forced into regular contact with these people, you have likely observed that they casually disrespect you and others around them. they may leverage disrespect and speaking over you to achieve a power dynamic. it is not only not wrong to knock them off their high horse, but important for the group dynamic surrounding them. the longer they are allowed to ride their high horse unchecked, the more toxic they become.these people may have redeeming qualities that seem to disappear once they've ridden their high horse too long. it is important to bring these types back to earth when they get this way. doing so unfortunately necessitates your return of that disrespect in a healthy dose. if you are quiet and they exploit that, make a point of interrupting them occasionally- especially around people who would rather listen to you anyway. if they dish out casual disrespect, return it just as casually yet steadfast, so they know you're aware of it, and know you represent a threat to them should they continue. if they're making jokes at someone's expense, turn the tables on them and redirect the joke to their expense. the thing about them is they'll 99% of the time say, ""why are you so sensitive?"" or ""come on, i'm just having a little fun"" if you call them out in a serious way. they'll gaslight the fuck out of you, so you've got to feed them their own medicine just as casually. this may a sound toxic, but it's how these sorts of people operate. and when they get too comfortable - when they know you are a quiet, polite person who wouldn't criticize a fly- they'll only gather speed. handling their toxicity requires a measured amount reflected back at them. you'll honestly be amazed how most of them are caught off guard and rarely retaliate aggressively. reminding them you can bite, but choose not to unless provoked, is important to dealing with these people (who can otherwise be decent people when they aren't allowed to get on the high horse in the first place).",13,1,"LPT: Gut-check people who have a habit of putting other people down.

16563,"&gt; attachment theory is a psychological, evolutionary and ethological theory concerning relationships between humans. the most important tenet is that young children need to develop a relationship with at least one primary caregiver for normal social and emotional development. the theory was formulated by psychiatrist and psychoanalyst john bowlby.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/attachment_theory?wprov=sfti1)***[here’s an introduction to attachment theory by school of life](https://youtu.be/2s9acdmcpja). they have many follow-up videos on the concept, like [the challenges of anxious-avoidant relationships](https://youtu.be/oyoivchvwki). i personally find them to be great starting points into thinking about this theory on a more personal level.they are many quizzes online that can aid in determining your attachment style. i don’t have the qualifications to recommend one over another, so just find what seems reliable to you and try it out. i think, over time, your attachment style will become more internally apparent to you as you reflect on the various types and how they’ve played out in your life anyway.***once you have a good handle on what attachment theory is about, what the various attachment styles are, and which one you most strongly exhibit in the types of relationships you’re struggling with, i find it helpful to start thinking about the following:- how your parents (and others) influenced you to have this attachment style- the attachment style your parents seem to have in relation to you (there are online quizzes that can help with this)- the attachment style of people you’ve struggled to have relationships with- whether you’ve had a relationship of any kind, big or small, with someone who seemed to have a fairly secure attachment style- how you might try to form more relationships with people who have a secure attachment style- how you might make the most of relationships with people who don’t have a secure attachment style, knowing what you know about the foibles of the various insecure styles***what inspired this tip was a session with my therapist where we walked through how my attachment style may help explain why i sought out certain relationships as well as why i engaged in certain behaviors during my time with those people. i know therapy isn’t accessible to a great deal of people around the world, let alone valued by others who simply don’t find it necessary. i thought this could be a nice self-help tool for people in either boat.",6,1,"LPT: If you’re having trouble with personal relationships, you may greatly benefit from determining your attachment style as well as that of those closest to you",Adult

17463,"this (insanely long and in depth) post is much more than just a review of the book: the slight edge – it’s a comprehensive manual to success. i’m going to give you a tonne of my own tips and tricks, and walk you through my own process for achieving my goals. i’ll tell you exactly how i set my goals, how i come up with attainable deadlines, how i deal with bad days and how i stay motivated for long periods of time (some of my goals have taken years to accomplish).# part 1 - intro# 1.1 – how this book has helped mewhen i first read the slight edge, it completely changed the way i view goal-setting and self-improvement. i’d even go so far as to say it’s shaped my entire life philosophy; i’m always going on and on about the concept in the book that “each day, take one or two small baby steps towards your goal. slow, consistent progress over time.” i got that from this book.another philosophy of mine also comes from this book. “shut up and actually take action; stop sitting around overthinking things. stop trying to be perfect and instead just start, and accept the fact you’ll suck for a while. you’ll naturally improve over time.”i’ve used the slight edge to achieve almost all of the big goals in my life, and countless smaller goals as well.* i completed a 365 project where i took a photo a day for an entire year, without missing a single day.* lost 35 kg by taking it one day at a time.* built my main website and wrote 150+ articles* built a coaching/counselling business so i could quit my regular job and be financially-independent.* went from being a weakling in the gym to rack-pulling 200kg (441lbs).* paid off $10,000 in debt by just chipping away at it, a bit at a time.* overcame my social-phobia and started making friends by pushing myself to step out of my comfort zone each day.* fixed my dating life by just talking to one girl a day out in public.* a tonne of smaller goals the book has helped me with. things like:* paying off other debts.* building my social circle.* getting a promotion at my old job.* setting challenges &amp; achieved them such as writing 33 articles in 21 days (over on my main site), writing 5 articles in 10 hours, etc.* writing a 130,000-word series on my main site (that’s longer than most novels.)* forcing myself to do things i was terrified to do by using techniques from the book. eg i got a tattoo (i’d procrastinated that for years), moved in order to chase my dreams, got a vasectomy, etc.* changing my diet and cutting out junk food.* quitting addictions (alcohol, pornography, video games and sugary food).my girlfriend has used it to achieve a tonne of her goals too.* she used it to get an internship with absolutely zero experience in the field.* she lost 10kg.* started her own art business.* overcame an eating disorder (bulimia).* talked to 15 random strangers on the street (goal was she had to have at least a 5 minute conversation with each one).* learned to do the splits.* deadlifted 100kg.* moved out of home and became independent.* did 1 piece of artwork a day.* a tonne of other, smaller goals.most of my coaching clients, as well as a number of my friends, use the principles from the book to achieve their goals too.the slight edge helps you be way more organised with your goals/life, and be way more committed to getting the things you want. i read the book at least once a year, and so does my girlfriend. it’s extremely motivating and feel-good, as well as very practical. it’s perfect for getting you back on track if you’ve been a bit lazy lately… or if you’re embarking on your first big self-improvement mission.there are some gaps in the slight edge book – some areas i feel are a little short. this guide is my spin on the slight edge – i’ve modified it a lot to add in everything i’ve learned over the years from using it and reaching my own goals. don’t get me wrong – the slight edge is an amazing book. we’re just going to make it even better 😉# 1.2 – key concepts from the bookas i said above, i’ve made a few modifications to the slight edge formula. here’s the core concepts from the book + my own additions:* work on your goals every day – aim to take one tiny little baby step towards your goals each day. even on your worst, most horrible day, you should still do something – even if it’s something pathetically small and seemingly-insignificant. it all adds up.* don’t spend months trying to come up with a “perfect” plan, or “researching”, or “educating yourself” – just give yourself permission to suck and dive right in. take action, right now. you’ll be able to tweak and adjust your plan once you start anyway.* have 1 or 2 main goals you pour most of your time and energy into. you can add a couple of extra “mini-goals” at the same time; but they shouldn’t interfere with your main 1 or 2 goals.* goals need to be tangible, realistic, achievable, and meaningful to you.* set deadlines for your goals. those deadlines also need to be realistic. you’ll never be successful without the time-pressure of a looming deadline to push yourself; especially during your lazy days/weeks.* go all-in. do whatever it takes to reach your goals by the deadlines you’ve set.* reaching your goals requires sacrifices; you have to be willing to give things up. maybe that’s giving up your bad habits, or giving up the things that make you lazy/complacent, or giving up time-wasting activities. sometimes you have to say no to things to free up time/energy to work on your goals.the core message of the book, and my own philosophy is this:**every day is either a step forward, or a step back.** you’re either on the path heading towards success, or on the path away from success.small habits matter, because they add up over time. eg: let’s say you have a day where you’re craving junk food like crazy. you decide, “screw it” and you go eat mcdonalds for lunch, instead of something healthy. in that one instance it won’t matter too much – it’s just 1 mcdonalds meal. but by taking the lazy path in that one moment, you’re opening the door for building a habit of regularly choosing junk food in the future. each time you make the “bad choice”, you’re building a habit of straying from your goals. you’re ensuring it’ll be easier to make bad choices again in the future.if instead you decide “ok, i’ll go eat something healthy instead” – in the moment it won’t matter all that much. nobody loses all their bodyfat with just 1 healthy meal. but by choosing the healthy choice, you’re building a habit of working towards your goals. you’re making it easier to make good choices again in the future.good choices add up over time.tiny little baby steps add up over time.# 1.3 – extra benefits of the slight edgean important part of the slight edge is setting clear deadlines for your goals, and doing everything it takes to achieve those goals on time. once you build a habit of always achieving your goals before the deadline is up, you’ll start to believe, “ok. i can literally do anything i set my mind to, as long as i’m patient and willing to keep working on it, a little bit every day.”you’ll be able to set a goal and give yourself, say, 3 months to complete it. you’ll know at the end of those 3 months, you’ll have achieved the goal. this is revolutionary because it gives you a timeline for your life. you’ll be able to look at your calendar, look at the goals you’ve set, and start planning out, “ok, in 3 months i’ll have achieved this goal. then i can start working on this other goal i have. that goal will probably take me…. 5 months? after that, it’ll be december, so then i’ll start working on this next goal here. that one will take me about 9 months, so i’ll have it done by august next year.” you’ll be able to map out the next 12 months or so of your life, and you’ll know exactly where you’ll be at the end of it.it’s exciting because you get to fantasise about what you want, what you want to achieve, what things would be really cool to have – and then actually go and make them happen. self-improvement is supposed to be really fun and exciting – you literally get to have anything you want (as long as you’re willing to work for it). it’s like being a little kid again; there are no limits, only your own imagination.if you don’t have any goals, or deadlines, or a map of how you want your next 12 months to go, it can be easy to feel lost. a lot of people feel this way because they don’t have a timeline in front of them – it’s all kind of wishy-washy, like they’re looking out to sea with have no idea what’s out there. they might have some goals they want to work on, some things they want to achieve – but because they haven’t set deadlines for those goals, they’re just sorta staring out into the void, with no idea when those goals will happen (if ever?) they’re essentially letting out a big sigh and saying, “hmmm, i hope this all works out.”the slight edge puts the power back in your hands – you’re now assertive and taking charge. you’re not longer just a passive passenger in your own life, with goals “hopefully” working out on their own, as if by magic/luck (life doesn’t work that way). now you get to actually take the steps towards your goals – just a little baby step each day. now you actually get to make your goals happen, instead of just wishing for them.knowing the goals you’re working on also makes it really fun when someone says to you, “hey how’s your life going?” or “tell me more about yourself?” you’ll get really excited, because you’re on a mission . you’ll say, excitedly, “ok so right now i’m working on losing 5kg of fat, i’m learning to rock climb with the goal being to go climbing in this mountain range a few hours from my house. then i’m going to start my own website; the goal is to publish my first article by the end of april. oh and i’m working extra shifts at work because i’m saving up to buy myself a new computer. in may i’m going to start learning a bit of carpentry with my buddy, because i’ve always wanted to learn that.”everybody else talks about doing cool things with their life. you’ll actually be doing cool things with your life. other people are passive; they’re sit around talking about the life they want to live someday. you’re actually living it.you’ll also find yourself feeling more confident in what you want – you’ve written it down, set a deadline, you know you’re going to get there with a little work each day. your goals will be solidified, and you’ll take them seriously.you’ll find achieving your first couple of slight edge goals imbues you with a confidence, a sense of self that’s unmatched by anything else.# 1.4 – where to buy the bookyou need to buy the book and read it before you continue with this guide. the book is required reading in order to get the most out everything i’m going to say – especially when it comes to goals.it’s a very easy read – you can read it all in one sitting. it’s so well written and fun to read that it’s almost like a motivational book (but obviously the point of the book is to take action, not just read yet another self-help book.)# part 2 – setting goals2.1 – how to come up with your goals; dream bigthink about what you ultimately want. and i don’t just mean goals you think are attainable for you right now – i want you to dream big. let your mind fantasise and come up with the wildest goals you can think of – even if they’re goals that make you think, “i could never do that.” even if they’re goals that would take several years to achieve. even if they’re goals that seem like a pipe dream – completely impossible. i’ve achieved a bunch of things that at one point felt utterly impossible to me.if you’re struggling to come up with goals you want to work on, go sit in a quiet park somewhere or sit in your room and ask yourself this question:**what do i want?**it might take you a few minutes, or hours, or even days to really decide what you want. that’s ok; just keep asking yourself, “what do i want?” and eventually something will come up. deep down you know what you really want; just give yourself permission to admit you want it, even if you think it’s too far-fetched or too impossible. nothing’s impossible, but you have to admit you want it first.when i first started teaching my girlfriend the slight edge philosophy, and she achieved her first few goals, it blew her mind that she was actually allowed to have the things she wanted. she was astounded to learn that if you just work for it, you truly can have whatever you want. i jokingly told her, “you can even get to the moon if you want to, as long as you take a baby step towards it every single day.”once you’ve come up with the goals you really want, write them all down on a piece of paper or in an online note-keeping app (i use evernote). again, don’t stress if the things you want seem unattainable – every single big goal i’ve ever achieved seemed impossible to me before i started working on it. we’ll break down the goals into smaller, more manageable steps anyway.it’s important your goals are things you get really excited about; things you care about deeply and will be motivated to work on. you’re going to have times where your goals are hard, you’re going to have days where you have very little willpower or energy or motivation. if the goals you chose aren’t really all that meaningful to you, it’ll be easier to give up/quit on your bad days. so make sure the goals you set are ones you desperately want; then you’ll never quit.we’re trying to make your life awesome; not just set arbitrary goals that have you spinning your wheels for no real benefit.when you’ve written all your goals down in a big list, you’ll probably feel like there’s a lot; maybe too many goals. that’s perfectly normal; you don’t have to work on all of them at once. don’t get overwhelmed by how many things you want to change; we’ll be tackling them a couple at a time. keep all of your goals in that notebook/note-keeping app, and tell yourself it’s ok to postpone some of them while you work on a couple of goals at a time.the other goals aren’t going anywhere. you’ve got an entire lifetime to work on yourself, so don’t stress.the question i get asked the most is: should i focus on dating first, or career first? my answer is always dating first; for a million reasons i’ve covered in articles on my main site. go 100% all-in with your dating life, give it everything you’ve got for a few years, and tell yourself you’ll work on your career/finances once you’ve handled the dating phase of your life.i’ve got my own huge list of goals i want to achieve – there’s over 100 things on it at this point. i don’t let myself get overwhelmed by how many things i still need to do; i just work on a couple of them at a time, and remind myself, “i have the rest of my life to do everything. no point stressing and worrying about “running out of time.”# 2.2 – “i will”, not “i want to”you need to phrase your goals as “i will do this” – implying you will be successful. really, i’m referring to going all-in, and taking your goals seriously. do not say, “i want this goal” or “it’d be really nice to have this goal” or the worst of them all; “i wish i could have this goal”.when you use passive language like “i want” or “i wish”, you’re telling yourself it’s just a pipe dream; something you’ll never really have. it’s why you hear people who’ve been fat for years say things like, “i want to be thin” or “i’d really like to be thin”, instead of, “i will be thin”.instead, tell yourself you are going to be successful.“i will get to 70kg by jan 20th”.“i will make $100,000 through my business.”“i will benchpress 120kg.”take charge and decide you will achieve your goals.when you make a goal, you have to sign a metaphorical-contract with yourself that you will not fail it. tell yourself you will be successful, no matter what.my mindset has always been, “if i don’t do this, i have to kill myself. failure is not an option.” yep, i literally frame my goals as “do or die”, “sink or swim”. i’m not saying you need to consider suicide – but i can’t deny that all-or-nothing mentality has been probably the biggest reason i’ve been so successful. as soon as you say to yourself, “i will succeed at this, no matter how long it takes, or how many times i fail” – you’re guaranteeing your own success. i’ll talk more about never quitting below.you have to give yourself permission to do whatever it takes to be successful. go all-in.# 2.3 – make your goals tangible, positive &amp; achievable, with a finish linethe goals you set have to be:**tangible:** as in, a concrete number/value. not, “i will get thin by december 12th” – how will you know when you’ve achieved that? and what is “thin”? 80kg? 75kg? 70kg? you need to use an actual, tangible metric. a better goal would be, “i will get to 70kg by december 12th.”another example: “i will get more muscular by feb 2nd” is not a tangible goal. instead, rewrite it with an actual metric: “i will get my weight up to 80kg by feb 2nd” or “i’ll benchpress 100kg by feb 2nd”.***positive:*** frame your goals as a positive thing you will achieve, rather than a negative thing you’ll stop doing. for instance, “i will quit smoking by december 12th” is a negative-framing, and all you’re going to do is burn through your willpower, sitting around thinking about the thing you’re not allowed to do. not doing something isn’t the end-goal; it’s a stepping-stone to achieving the actual goal you want. yes, quit smoking – but frame your goal as something positive you’re going to do instead of the negative habit.it would be better framed as, “i will run at 10km/hr pace for 10 minutes on the treadmill, by december 12th.” that’s a positive goal that will probably require you to quit smoking in order to achieve it; awesome. now you have something positive to run towards, rather than just a negative habit to run away from (with nothing positive to replace it with).another example: “i will stop pussying out with women by january 19th” is not a positive goal. reframe it as a positive goal: “i will hit on 100 girls by january 19th”.people get stuck in downward spirals because they only focus on the negative – “i’m really unhappy with where i am right now” – but they don’t then turn that into anything positive. sitting in that cycle of self-loathing will only cause you to become helpless and hopeless; you’ll have all these insecurities and negative feelings, with no way to change anything.frame your goals in a positive manner instead.***deadline:*** your goals must also have a realistic and achievable deadline. we’ll cover deadlines in detail below.***achievable*****:** the goals you set need to be achievable. if you set an unrealistic goal, you likely won’t achieve it – which leads to frustration, disappointment and self-loathing. if you repeat this and set multiple goals you can’t finish on time, you may start to believe you’re not capable of achieving any goals – a horrific habit to build.instead, break those massive goals down into smaller goals. if you want to earn 1 million dollars, break that down into a smaller goal – “i’ll earn $2000 from a new business i start, by june 26.” once you achieve that goal, you can then set a new target (eg $5,000), and then another new target, and a new one after that – eventually working your way up to 1 million.***finish line:*** your goals also need to have an end-point; they can’t be daily habits. by that i mean you should write your goal as a tangible destination; rather than some habit you repeat. so don’t say, “i will walk every day for 10 minutes”. you’re inevitably going to have bad days where you don’t do any walking, and then what – you’ve failed your goal entirely?instead, write your goal as an end-point you can get to. eg: “i will walk a quarter-marathon (6.5 miles) by march 20th.”goal setting only works if you have an end goal; a destination to work towards with a deadline to keep you on track. daily habits help you achieve that goal; but they’re not a goal in and of themselves.# 2.4 – deadlines are key; make sure they’re realistic and achievabledeadlines are the most important part of achieving your goals; nothing lights a fire under your ass like only having a week or two left to complete your goal. you’ll often find the pareto principle applies here – you’ll do 80% of the work in the last 20% of the weeks you’ve given yourself.it’s very important you set very lenient deadlines – deadlines that give you enough time to absolutely reach your goal on time. always allow for extra time in case something goes wrong. for example, for strength goals i’ve set myself in the gym, i set a deadline – say, 3 months from now. then i’ll allow for something going wrong: “what would happen if i hurt my leg or something and need to take 3 weeks off?” i then add an extra 3 weeks to my deadline, to allow for unforeseen consequences. so even if life throws me a curveball, i know i’ll still hit my goal on time.remember, you can always bust your ass and reach your goal early. i’m not saying to slack off and be lazy for those extra 3 weeks. they’re only there as a safety net, incase something pops up you hadn’t accounted for (which happens probably 90% of the time, especially with longterm goals).it’s very important you set realistic and attainable deadlines, and make it your mission to get a few successes under your belt. your first few goals should be extremely easy and doable – start small. being successful with your first couple of easy goals helps you gain traction. once you have a taste of success and achieving a goal – even a small one – you’ll be hungry for more. your success will snowball. you won’t want to stop.over enough time, and with achieving enough goals, you you’ll start to feel like a successful person. achieving your goals will be the norm, not the exception. you’ll start feeling like you can do absolutely anything you want. you can even get to the moon, if you want to. 😉i know it can be tempting to give yourself very short deadlines when you’re first starting out with self-improvement. you’re acutely aware of all the things you want to change, and you feel like you can’t afford to waste any time. i get that.but trust me, speaking from my own experience and the experience of countless clients of mine, it is better to set realistic deadlines you can actually achieve, so you can build a habit of completing your goals. there’s nothing worse than setting 5 goals with very short deadlines, missing all of them, and feeling like a complete failure. i’ve seen too many people throw in the towel and quit because they screwed themselves with unrealistic deadlines. don’t be one of them. you’re smarter than that.it’s more important to be able to teach yourself: “i set very easy and achievable goals. some of them are stupidly easy and maybe i could have pushed myself more, but at least i can say i achieve 100% of all the goals i ever set. once i set a goal, it’s basically guaranteed i will achieve it.“keep your deadlines realistic and attainable – and allow a little extra time to account for the unexpected.# 2.5 – 1 (or 2) main goals you obsess aboutone question i get asked all the time is: “which is better: having 1 or 2 main goals i really obsess about… or spreading myself out a bit and working on 10 little goals at once?”my answer is always: pick 1 or 2 main goals you obsess over, and pour 99% of your energy into them. you can then add a couple of really small goals you work on in the background; but your main 1 or 2 goals will always need to take priority. almost everything worth having requires you to go all-in and give it everything you’ve got; there’s no point spreading yourself thin and half-assing 10 goals. you’ll just end up “jack of all trades; master of none.”as i said earlier, when choosing which 1 or 2 main goals you’ll prioritise, you really need to be ok with “neglecting” some of your other goals a bit. you really have to give the vast majority of your time and attention to your 1 or 2 main goals. write the other goals down in a notebook/note-keeping app, and tell yourself you’ll come back to them after you complete your main 1 or 2 goals first.sometimes it won’t be clear to you which goal you should prioritise. maybe you want to start working on your dating life, but you’re 50lbs overweight and not sure if you should lose fat first, or start talking to girls first. different people will give you different advice (my advice is always to lose a lot of the fat as your main goal, while also starting to talk to girls as a minor, secondary goal). generally speaking, it doesn’t matter too much which goal you work on first. you have plenty of time to handle all your goals – so don’t stress about getting the order perfect. just start working on a goal – any goal – right now.when setting the deadline(s) for your 1 or 2 main goal(s), really sit down and plan it out. you might need to do a day or two of research (but don’t waste weeks researching – taking action is more important than spending weeks researching). research how long other people have taken to achieve similar goals. research what might go wrong; what pitfalls those people had. think about whether there’s any extenuating circumstances that might slow your progress compared to other people – or any circumstances that might speed it up.once you’ve figured out how long you’ll need to complete the goal, add extra time onto it to account for the unpredictable nature of this thing we call life. generally speaking, i like to add 20% extra time just to be safe. (remember, you’re allowed to complete your goal early – in fact, it feels really bloody good to do so.)i personally like to set big goals that will take 6-12 months to achieve, but you can pick shorter or slightly longer goals if you like. i wouldn’t go too far over 12 months; that’s usually too far into the future that it’s hard to stay motivated and enthusiastic for that long. if you have a goal that’ll take over a year to complete, just break it down into a shorter goal. eg if your goal is to lose 50kg, break it down to: “i will lose 25kg in 30 weeks.”your mindset with your main 1 or 2 goals needs to be: i will do whatever it takes to succeed. this will usually mean becoming absolutely obsessed with it. spend every spare second you have obsessing about it, focusing on it. for example, if your goal is to lose 25kg in 30 weeks:every time you have some spare time, read through every fat-loss and exercise site/forum you can find.* listen to fat-loss podcasts/audiobooks on the way to work.* during your lunch break at work, read every article on aworkoutroutine.* when you finish work, go for a 30 minute walk – even if you’re tired.* after dinner, spend the evening learning about calorie-counting, about macros and protein and carbs and fat, etc.* before you go to bed, post on a fat-loss forum to keep yourself accountable.* then go to bed and dream about losing fat.* wake up tomorrow and repeat the obsession.sidenote: you can still work on your other smaller goals – they’ll just be extra tasks you do when you have some free time. you’ll be making small amounts of progress towards them, so it’s not like you’re completely neglecting them or ignoring them; they’re just not your absolute main mission right now. you won’t be obsessed with them like you will with your main 1 or 2 goals.obsessing about your goals is the best way to get shit done and live an awesome life. forget all the nonsense people spout about “moderation”. that’s normie-talk. normies have no fucking clue how good it feels to wake up every day and go for what you truly want in life. they have no idea how good it feels to be taking baby steps towards their goals every day. normies have no clue what it means to feel alive.when you set goals and start working towards them, you’ll wake up each day with a purpose, knowing you’re on a mission, knowing you get to have absolutely anything you want – as long as you’re willing to work for it. you’ll know you’re working towards things you truly care about.without a doubt, the reason i’ve been successful with all my big goals is because i’ve always become obsessed with them. i think about them 16 hours a day, from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed, and every spare second in between. it’s my unwavering obsession which has lead to my success.you will have to make some sacrifices along the way – you’ll have to give up some of your vices. you’ll have to say no to certain things. you’ll have to put your goals first and prioritise them, and sometimes that’ll mean saying no to things like going \`clubbing on a friday night and getting completely drunk. sometimes you’ll have to be the nerd who goes home at 10pm to get an early night, so he’s fresh for the gym the next morning.you’ll also have to give up your complacency – no more coming home from work each day and playing video games for 4 hours before going to bed. no more lazing around on the couch all weekend watching netflix. no more wasting all your money on throwaway stuff you don’t really need. to some degree, you’ll have to grow up and start being responsible – and you’ll definitely have to start taking yourself seriously.i never said success was easy; only that it’s inevitable if you’re willing to work for it. if it was easy, everybody would be successful. big dreams require big sacrifices.# 2.6 – and then set a couple of smaller, easier mini-goalsonce you’ve set your main 1 or 2 goals and have chosen realistic deadlines (if they’re not realistic, go back and change them now), you can add an extra couple of small goals if you want to. i call these “mini-goals”.let me make this really clear: your mini-goals must absolutely not interfere with your main 1 or 2 goals. they can’t be big things like losing 15kg or talking to 200 girls or starting a business. they have to be super small, super easy things like, “i’ll spring clean my kitchen” or “i’ll update my resume” or “i’ll go to 2 meetups“. you want them to be so stupidly easy you’re almost guaranteed to do them.and when setting the deadline for your mini-goals, give yourself plenty of time to do them; don’t pressure yourself with a short deadline. because remember, your main 1 or 2 goals need to take priority above all else. you don’t want to pile on extra stress from your mini-goals. they’re supposed to be nice little “bonuses” that only take a couple days to complete. the idea is you work on them whenever you have a spare hour or so here and there.make sure it’s only a couple of mini-goals at once; don’t go overboard. 3 mini-goals at the most (on top of your 1 or 2 main goals). i like to use these mini-goals as a great way to finally complete stuff i’ve been procrastinating for ages and putting off. here’s some of the mini-goals i’ve set in the past:* cleaning out the fridge, washing all the racks, making it look brand new. deadline: 2 weeks.* sending 10 people a copy of my resume and seeing if anyone is hiring. deadline: 2 months.* add 5kg to my deadlift. deadline: 2 months.* taking 3 new photos for my online dating accounts. deadline: 6 weeks.* attending 5 new meetups. deadline: 3 months.* reading a book from start to finish. deadline: 1 month.* listening to 5 self-help podcasts. deadline: 2 months.* doing 10 pullups in a row. deadline: 3 months.* sell my old books. deadline: 3 months.* buy 2 new outfits. deadline: 4 weeks.as you can see, those mini-goals were really easy so they didn’t get in the way of my main 2 goals. i gave myself really long deadlines – sometimes as much as a few months, even though most of them only took a few hours to complete. and that’s the point. they’re supposed to be really easy mini-goals you work on in the background, while focusing your attention on your main 1 or 2 goals.don’t overwhelm yourself by taking on too much. it’s better to take on too little, and finish all your goals early. then, you can just immediately set some new goals. there’s no punishment for finishing all your goals early, but there’s some very huge negatives to missing your deadlines.you want your mini-goals to be automatic victories to get you into the habit of setting a goal, setting a deadline, doing a tiny bit each day to work towards it, then hitting your goal on or before your deadline. you want success to become a habit; something you always achieve. setting easy mini-goals with long deadlines guarantees that.# 2.7 – write your goals somewhere you’ll see them every day (calendar reminders)it’s important you display your goals (and their deadlines) somewhere prominent – somewhere you’ll see them every day (or even better, multiple times a day).some people like to write their goals on a big whiteboard in their living room.other people write them as sticky notes on their bathroom mirror.i stick my goals on my phone desktop (as a widget), so they’re right in my face every single time i open up my phone.i use the phone widget app called countdown widget to display the number of days left on each goal:every time i pull out my phone, this is staring me right in the face.i also add my goals to my google calendar, and i add reminders to go off when the deadlines are getting close. i like to set multiple reminders for my big important goals (the 1 or 2 main goals):– 3 weeks before the deadline.– 2 weeks before the deadline.– 1 week before the deadline.– 2 days before the deadline.whatever method(s) you go with, make sure your goals are always on your mind – you want to be obsessing about them every single day. particularly your 1 or 2 main goals.that’s it – that’s the secret to success. nothing else matters; just never quit. never give up, never stop pushing forward, and even on your absolute worst days when life kicks your fucking ass, just keep hanging in there. hold on for dear life and weather the storm. don’t quit.because if you just hold on, if you keep going and never quit, you will eventually be successful. even if it takes you some insane amount of time like 10 years (don’t worry, it won’t), you will get there eventually. if you ran a marathon and all you could do was crawl, after 24 hours you would eventually crawl across the finish line and guess what? you’d have successfully finished a marathon. when you finally achieve the goal you’ve been dreaming of for months/years, do you really think you’re going to give a shit how long it took?that consistent crawl is the key to success. take at least 1 baby step towards your goal, every day.if you've made it this far, good on you. this post was so long i reached the character limit on reddit. if you'd like to read the final part 3 that gets to the nitty gritty of achieving your own goals an how i applied everything i've already written, it's here at: [https://kyil-extra.com/slight-edge/#chapter-3-achieving-your-goals](https://kyil-extra.com/slight-edge/#chapter-3-achieving-your-goals)any questions, let me know\- andy",2,1,LPT: Take small actions every day to achieve your goals (Book discussion on: 'The Slight Edge' - and how it changed my life),Adult

803,"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jan/09/joe-biden-labor-workers-rights-unions-wagesoon after joe biden is inaugurated as the next us president, he is expected to take several strong steps on the labor front aimed at reversing or remedying the policies of donald trump – who promised workers a lot and delivered little.but biden’s number one priority will be to tackle the issues left in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.healthcare to the electoral college: seven ways 2020 left america exposedrobert reichrobert reichread morebiden’s nominee for secretary of labor, marty walsh – the mayor of boston and before that a labor leader for decades – is likely to help advance biden’s promises to help unions expand. walsh, who had headed boston’s federation of building trades unions, is expected to support increased spending on infrastructure to upgrade roads and bridges, strengthen the economy and create good-paying jobs. as mayor, he pushed for construction contractors to hire more workers of color.with covid-19 still raging across the us, many job safety experts say it’s urgent for biden to do something that the trump administration has failed to do: issue nationwide regulations directing businesses to take specific steps to protect their workers from the coronavirus, whether retail, restaurant, factory or construction workers.trump’s business-friendly occupational safety and health administration (osha) repeatedly rejected labor unions’ pleas to adopt such safety standards.“clearly priority one is an emergency standard for osha dealing with covid and equally a focused, full-on press on inspections, enforcement and guidance. it means doing everything osha hasn’t been doing,” said david weil, a top labor department official under barack obama. “ultimately the only way we’ll get public safety and reopening is if we get worker safety.”weil, now the dean at brandeis university’s heller school for social policy, said osha under biden should get far tougher than trump’s osha in holding employers accountable for failing to take steps to minimize covid. many worker advocates were dismayed by the modest fines that trump’s osha assessed, for instance, a $13,494 penalty against smithfield’s pork-processing plant in sioux falls, south dakota, where at least 1,294 workers contracted covid. smithfield’s parent company had revenues of $24.1bn last year.biden has signaled he will take many other pro-worker actions.although trump held himself out as a champion of workers, he did nothing to raise the minimum wage or enact paid leave, while biden has repeatedly called for a $15 minimum wage and guaranteeing workers 12 weeks’ paid family and medical leave. biden has also backed far-reaching legislation that would make it easier to unionize, and his appointees to the national labor relations board (nlrb) are likely to reverse many trump labor board decisions that made it harder for workers to join unions.steven pitts, a longtime labor economist at the university of california, berkeley, said biden should pursue two sets of labor policies. “one is try to raise and protect labor standards like a higher minimum wage and tougher safety rules,” he said. “second is to build worker power into policy. too often we focus on the former and not the latter.”biden has indicated he will seek to build worker power by strengthening unions. on election day eve, campaigning in western pennsylvania, he promised to be “the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen”. in his campaign platform, biden endorsed the protecting the right to organize act (pro act) which would make it easier for unions to organize workers by, among other things, greatly increasing penalties on corporations that break the law in battling to keep out unions.solid republican opposition, along with a filibuster, blocked efforts by barack obama and bill clinton to enact pro-union legislation, and it will be similarly difficult for biden to enact the pro act unless he musters 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.because senate republicans so often vote in line with corporate america’s wishes, it might also be difficult for biden to get a $15 minimum wage or paid family and medical leave through the senate.william samuel, director of government affairs at afl-cio, the largest federation of unions in the us, acknowledges that passing the pro act – a huge goal of labor – won’t be easy. he recommends that biden, in addition to pushing to pass the pro act, pursue a parallel strategy: “he should use his bully pulpit to support the right of workers to organize and to shame employers who trample on those rights” – for example, by criticizing amazon for firing the worker who led a new york walkout over covid-19 safety.“there will be lots of obstacles in his [biden’s] way and we can hope and pray he can use his executive authority and the bully pulpit to advance the cause of workers,” samuel said.because the senate might be a formidable barrier to pro-union or pro-worker legislation, samuel says biden should use federal procurement policy to raise standards for workers. many worker advocates want biden to require federal contractors to pay their workers a minimum of $15 an hour and guarantee them two-weeks’ paid medical and family leave.biden and his running mate, kamala harris, opposed a california ballot initiative in which voters – swayed in part by a $200m campaign financed by uber and other app-based companies – approved a measure that categorizes uber and lyft drivers and doordash delivery workers as independent contractors rather than employees. by defining them as independent contractors, the ballot initiative, known as proposition 22, means these workers won’t receive state minimum wage or overtime protections, won’t receive paid sick days or unemployment compensation and won’t have their companies reimburse their expenses, like gasoline.uber has said it hopes to pass prop 22-like laws or ballot initiatives to other states. but pitts said: “how do we find a way to stop the spread of prop 22 around the country – that’s an important thing.”it’s going to be a slog to undo all the damage that’s been done the past four years by the trump majority on the boardwilma liebmanworker advocates hope biden’s labor department will issue guidance that goes far to trump prop 22 by saying that under federal minimum wage and overtime laws, uber and lyft drivers should be considered employees, not independent contractors, because they are not truly independent: uber and lyft have great control over the work the drivers do, and the drivers are not really independently in business for themselves.weil, who headed the labor department’s wage and hour administration, said prop 22’s definition of independent contractors contradicts the definition under the federal fair labor standards act, a 1938 law that creates nationwide minimum wage and overtime protections. “you just can’t decide, ‘i can treat them as independent contractors if that’s counter to what our fair labor standards act says,’” weil said.the trump administration recently awarded an $810m contract to uber and lyft to provide rides to public agencies. worker advocates say the general services administration should use its power to set contract conditions to insist that uber and lyft pay their drivers $15 an hour and treat them as employees.labor leaders say they hope biden’s nlrb will reverse many of the anti-union actions taken by trump’s nlrb – for instance, making it harder for workers at franchises like mcdonald’s to unionize, making it harder for small groups of workers at larger establishments to unionize, letting employers prohibit workers from using the company email system to discuss union matters, letting companies bar union organizers from spaces open to the public, like corporate cafeterias.“it’s going to be a slog to undo all the damage that’s been done the past four years by the trump majority on the board,” said wilma liebman, who was nlrb chair during obama’s first term. “their overruling of precedent has been so sweeping. they’ve overruled precedents that went back decades.”liebman said the trump board’s reversals of precedent twisted a pro-worker law, the national labor relations act, in ways that always favored employers. but republicans say the trump board was merely undoing what they saw as the unduly pro-union tilt of the obama board.",6,1,"[The Guardian] Biden’s nominee for Secretary of Labor Marty Walsh is likely to issue guidance at the federal level to trump Prop 22 by saying

1971,"**personal bias**:* i was swing trading $tsla since early this year with small-sized profits, but always exited positions because i believed it was overvalued. * finally decided to invest in a long position a few weeks before the split after really doing some dd and research on the company. * i'm in my late 20s, and anticipate investing in $tsla for the next 20+ years. * i own 13 shares with an average share price of $428. i have been dca'ing periodically on top of buying bits anytime it dips 6% or more.* i know these are rookie ass numbers and some of y'all have been invested way longer. i just wanted to share my thoughts on $tsla long term! ______________________**why i am extremely bullish**:1. i studied engineering in college like musk (actually he was in physics, but in a related, relevant field) and the concept of ethics + morality is emphasized &amp; deemed imperative throughout engineering + physics classes / seminars / programs. i kinda obsessed over musk this past year to try and understand his persona and character and thought-process and watched any interview i could find online, read his articles, watched live events, read reviews from past/current employees. it was pretty evident that this guy is interested in bettering the world (reducing emissions, decreasing dependence on foreign oil &amp; drilling, self-sustainability in homes, and more). from what i gathered, he genuinely believes in tesla's mission statement and most importantly, is confident in delivering. perhaps this is too anecdotal and emotional to have any real bearing, but i am bullish on companies motivated by the bigger picture (in this case energy).2. he has largely been focused on growth over profit, and this is the only correct approach imo to running a company that is tasked with introducing ground-breaking, societal-changing, futuristic technology to the world. ***here are some of tesla's major costs***:training a neural network to read the road like a human takes an extraordinary amount of resources. you want the ai to have seen every damn inch of the earth so it has exposure to different variabilities while driving and makes the safe, correct maneuver.  another is investing in producing in-house batteries. another is upgrading its facilities to better streamline production and increase efficiency. another is expanding its facilities themselves across the world like germany for example and then domestically like the giga in texas. another is solar technology. none of this stuff is profitable right now. no one is paying tesla for its efforts in optimizing the ai or for any of its other endeavors i just mentioned. they have a 35k car (model 3) to get an ev out there many can afford and thus build a reputation in the public of a working model..... its not to earn profits. tesla is focusing on solidifying its foundations now so that it can be profitable in the (increasingly near) future. 3. let's talk about the super high p/e value for $tsla stock. stock price keeps rising, but earnings stay low. this is the primary metric used by the $tsla bears suggesting the stock is overvalued and in a bubble that's about to burst. but if you agree with the points i made in #2 above, you can understand why the profits are low. $amzn had a period with a p/e of 1000+. in the ensuing years, though, its p/e came back down to more normal levels, but the stock price kept rising. why? because their earnings started to increase. and this is why it takes a believer and due diligence to invest in this stock. do you understand why tesla is focusing on growth over profits right now? do you believe that it can overcome challenges to produce a dope product (and service)? if you say no - then you are fine to think the p/e ratio is too damn high and you should not invest long term. but if you do your research, agree with their approach, and believe that tesla is going to become a highly profitable company, then who fucking cares about the p/e ratio! earnings will come and the p/e value will become averaged and normal while price will also increase. 4. there's the mandate to cease ice vehicle production by 2030-2035. it's a (largely) global mandate and so when that time comes, you're going to have to buy an ev. which guy do you think will have the most refined product? gm, porshe, volkswagen? or tesla, that has ***solely*** focused on ev for its lifespan? do you believe other companies can just magically catch-up and be on par with tesla experience-wise? keep in mind that many auto companies are being forced into ev. watch some (not so) old videos of gm mechanics &amp; engineers who proudly tout their gas-operated ices and mock evs like its some ridiculous technology. can you really believe that despite all these disadvantages, these same guys can produce a product superior to tesla? do you feel comfortable trusting a product with significantly lesser testing time than one who has been at it for years longer?5. autonomous driving. i keep reading that all the auto dealers can easily ""catch-up to the new ev technology"" to be on par with tesla's ev (which btw doesn't really make sense to me). but for fun let's say that somehow it happened. autonomous fsd needs to be tested thoroughly to be deemed safe for public use. won't that take years of trial and error and testing and more beta testing and changes and recalls and delays? like many of you, i've watched the fsd beta videos for tesla street driving ai. it is nothing short of incredible. yes of-course there are problems, though, and they are being worked on. this is all a normal r&amp;d procedure for fsd that any car dealer must complete before releasing to the public. how in the world can they catch-up so quickly then?6. as we have heard from the bulls (*maybe* *too many* *times...*), tesla isn't just a car company. its mission is to reduce emissions, increase self-sustainability (with solar panels for homes, cars), and revolutionize the electric grid with distributing solar power. also they sell these really comfy ass shorts. does gm sell comfy shorts? i'll wait.______________________**things that make me doubt tesla:**1. (this one is simply conjecture, not fact-based). a reduction in enthusiasm / effort towards tesla from elon musk due to having to manage all of his other endeavors. if spacex, starlink go public causing his workload to multiply, can we still expect tesla leadership to run the company with the same drive and motivation?2. i keep reading stories and reviews of tesla cars that need to go in for repairs shorty after being purchased. seat issues, door issues, tires falling out. my neighbor bought a model y and said he had to take it back the first week because there was problems with the seat not moving or something. he did say that after the repair, the car has been perfect and he'll never go back to an ice. still, pretty concerning that so much random shit seems to happen right outta the box. 3. even if they become the sole clear-cut leader in ev auto vehicles (2030), can we justify a market cap that compares to $amzn or $goog or $msft or $aapl? what if they also became the primary all-purpose electric energy solution for residence / commercial sectors? ___________**in summary,** i totally understand the doubts and uncertainties that many people have with buying $tsla stock, and even tesla cars. many investors see the p/e value and call it inflated / in a bubble. folks, this is futuristic, groundbreaking and developing technology. perhaps, just maybe, there are other metrics to gauge a stock then? i recommend reading tesla's engineering news, not just financial reports, to gain a clearer picture. due to some of musk's social media antics, the stock has become a meme stock / robinhooders joke stock (lol). all this time that tesla invests into its growth and r&amp;d (instead of profits), will pave the way for it to produce a leading, refined product in the ev sector. and yes, i did read elon's email about profits earlier today. please share your thoughts. thank you for reading.",2,1,Why I am bullish on Tesla long term.,Finance

2293,"**tl:dr is at the bottom**hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.my name’s mark and i’m an accountant with a passion for investing. about two years ago, i used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and privately held companies in the u.s. my goal is to bring my unique perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market today.i’m a long-term investor. i am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long time. i’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and everything that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led me to originally invest and believe in that company have not changed. if you want to learn more about this approach. i recommend reading the book “100 baggers” by chris mayer.**introduction**i’m excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month, smartsheet. i’m always looking for investment ideas. i run stock screeners with different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth), scan twitter, talk to professionals in different industries, and try to observe what products or services are getting popular with my friends and family. one of the best investment decisions i’ve made to date came after i talked to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf course. shout out to you celsius (celh)! with that being said, you never know where your next good investment idea is going to come from.in the case of smartsheet, i became aware of the company through a stock screener. i was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6b), strong revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a subscription business model (saas). once i became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. the more i learned about smartsheet, the more i liked. management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. in different roles i’ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, i’ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. i will touch on this more later in the write up.another positive signal i got about smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. i was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. i was watching an interview on my phone with mark mader, the ceo of smartsheet. my girlfriend overheard the word “smartsheet” mentioned in the video and said “are they talking about the smartsheet with the blue check mark?”. i had to google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same smartsheet. i asked her how she knew about it. she said “my company just transitioned all of our work onto smartsheet. i really love it. our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” hearing this just motivated me to learn more about smartsheet.**the thesis statement**for every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for smartsheet is as follows:*“smartsheet: a leader in collaborative work management (cwm) software. as the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.”*i think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what smartsheet does. if you go to smartsheet’s website and look at the “about” page, you will find their “about” statement which says “smartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.” notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.in my thesis statement, i mention that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm software space. but how do i know this? well, a highly reputable independent research firm named forrester conducted a study on the cwm space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, ui/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. i put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. as you can see, smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. let’s use our common sense for a second. at the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming saas company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? i think the answer should be a resounding yes. but what about these other companies on the list. let’s break them down 1 by 1:* workfront was recently bought by adobe. if you want to invest in workfront, you’d have to invest in the much larger company of adobe. it wouldn’t be a pure play investment into the cwm space.* smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)* wrike is private* servicenow – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space. also, the company is already quite large ($106b market cap)* asana is public but just ipo’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. we don’t have much data to track their performance as a publicly traded company. furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the cwm space, they’re not a leader and rank behind smartsheet in several of forrester’s categories. why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?* monday.com is private* microsoft – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.* atlassian – this company does primarily focus on cwm but i have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) they’re ranked way beneath smartsheet. 2) they’re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58b).now that we’ve established that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm space and that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let’s understand why this is important. other than the obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?well, let’s take a look at this quote from mark mader, smartsheet ceo, during the last earnings call (q3 fy21) that occurred on december 7th, 2020:“leaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. they understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.”key word here: asynchronous. asynchronous communication is different from synchronous communication. here is the difference:asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.any communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. as part of my research on smartsheet, i read an e-book that was written by the original co-founders of smartsheet, mark mader the current ceo and brent frei who is no longer with the company. they wrote the e-book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. the e-book is called “the power of done”. the moral of the book is that mark and brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. this is a quote from their e-book:“according to basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire u.s. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the american economy.”they mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. the fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what mark and brent referred to as the productivity paradox. they wanted to do something about it and thus they founded smartsheet.**how smartsheet makes money**at the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that i mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this isn’t to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things i look at.before i talk about the revenue streams of smartsheet, i want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. co-founder/ceo mark mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as microsoft excel. however, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. he wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. as a result, we now have smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and gantt view.the idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they’re hired to do – get work done. think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they’re at with their assignments. what if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? that’s what smartsheet looks to achieve.for smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. as i mentioned earlier, they are a software as a service (saas) company. whenever you see saas, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that’s a very good thing. with a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.smartsheet’s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based collaborative work management (cwm) platform. customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to smartsheet by collaborating with a company/individual that uses smartsheet. for subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using smartsheet within minutes.smartsheet offers four subscription levels: individual, business, enterprise, and premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.the connectors part of the business is something i find really interesting. basically, smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their smartsheet user interface. this helps position smartsheet as the true “command center” platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. you’ll see this on the link above but some products that smartsheet sells connectors for include adobe creative cloud, microsoft dynamics 365, salesforce, jira software, slack, and skype just to name a few.i think that being able to sell these connectors as ancillary pieces to the smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as “smartsheet competitors” actually become a piece of the smartsheet platform and can be sold by smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. this neutral angle that smartsheet is able to come from by selling connectors to their perceived “competitors” reminds me a little bit of how roku (roku) is able to earn revenue off of selling a netflix subscription on their platform. i think just the fact that all these big companies like adobe, jira, salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn’t allow for their products to be integrated with smartsheet.on top of the connectors to third party vendors that smartsheet is able to sell, smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. for example, in may 2019, smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. the name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them.also, in september 2020, smartsheet acquired brandfolder, inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. combining brandfolder capabilities with smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. this goes back to what i said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company’s marketing team was “really excited about smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” she told me that before smartsheet, her company’s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. she said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and sharepoint. now, all of the content is inside of smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. they can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. the acquisition of brandfolder is really what allows smartsheet to stand out in this department.nobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. the fact that smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with brandfolder is very promising. during smartsheet’s fy21 engage customer conference, anna griffin, smartsheet chief marketing officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500b for companies around the world. she said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to editor in chief. all kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company’s brand. sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and r&amp;d is teasing new product experiences in app. it can get really difficult for the company’s marketing/branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like brandfolder in smartsheet. this is just one reason why i think smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.as you can see, smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core cwm platform, the connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and brandfolder. on top of that, smartsheet also provides workapps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. there are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. traditionally, companies need to engage their it departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. this places a lot of strain on it departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. mark mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. he believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an it department employee who doesn’t even do the job that the app is being built for. also, he believes this will reduce strain on it departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.here is a quote from the director of sales (hina patel) at a smartsheet customer, cisco (nasdaq: csco): “i have been waiting for a solution like workapps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,” said hina patel, director of sales operations at cisco. “the ability to take our smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.” as you can see, the value proposition of workapps and the smartsheet platform appears to be high.lastly, smartsheet also generates revenue from professional services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the smartsheet platform. in the most recent quarter, q3 fy21, professional services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:subscription revenue = $90,890m for 91.8% of total revenueprofessional services revenue = $8,043m for 8.2% of total revenuethis is the end of my first article about

2394,"hello all, first post in this sub. have at it.just a opening discussion on facebook and the future.tbh, most of this should be known and common knowledge. regarding their recent investigation. this, imo, is just a shakedown for an eventual fine. the feds in this case are just asking for protection money. reason being? instagram and whatsapp are key to their whole social network.  in brief terms, facebook captures the eyes of older folk, instagram a competitor to snapchat / tiktok (youth) with whatsapp being pivoted to a payment service (akin to cashapp/venmo).with this, facebook has a hold on the entire social media market, as well as being apply to profit thru ads and profit from creator content. (think etsy for instagram, craigslist for facebook ‘for sale’ and a cashapp to securely do deals.)this should all be known. now where does oculus fit in? facebook isn’t a hardware company?🤷‍♀️. well, i saw a facebook phone floated ages ago during early android boom. it obviously never took off. too late to the game as other oss were being squeezed out for the eventual duopoly.many players have tried to iterate today the next phone; smart watches, google glass etc etc, seemed nice on paper, never more than a gimmick. oculus isn’t so much a diversification, but a new generation of product backed by an open blank checkbook, but why?facebook have bought a vr company to do portable ar/vr technology with the desire to emulate the google glass, but better, basically owning the entire mobile phone ++ market, and everyone’s eyeballs. this is key, they’ve seen apple go from strength to strength owning an entire platform.you can see this in their divergent approach from other vr headset makers, going wireless / cheaper / all in one. as that’s their end goal.that’s the long game, and if it comes off, it will print.where do microsoft come in? another ar/vr investor. currently facebook are ignoring commercial/industry ar/vr for things like meetings /remote support / remote hardware support. this sector is accelerating quickly pushed on by lock downs. likely don’t want to support them, despite being lucrative right now. again, owning consumer eyeballs is their mission. being responsible for a professional product takes a lot of work, consumers tolerate a lot more. microsoft are already deep in the professional market, and teams (and other office integration) will cement that fact.few companies have the r+d resources to break into this market, and it looks like apple are trying to make a car? (why? tesla isn’t booming because of carmaking...)once product hits the shelves, expect a google/apple method of creating an entire ecosystem where they hold the keys (their preferred domain: software). apple will be playing catch-up, google will need someone to make their hardware. i’m imaging facebook search engine, the works. (if i’m honest, this is the real monopoly we should be afraid of, not facebook / instagram / whatsapp, but google/apple/facebook platform dominance, setting their own rules for businesses trying to engage on them.)risks: the touted breakup, the current apple / epic lawsuit. damaging their ecosystem and making the platform holder less profitable is a risk to facebook. but i believe they have the resource, market cap and current profitability to buy any startup, trying to compete, out. if they are broken up, they’ll be more careful and rebuild. i doubt they will deviate from this course.risk2: who wants a facebook device? you can already see the hate for requiring a facebook account. well if they’re the only play in town, you’re gonna fomo people.side note 1: i don’t expect facebook to make these devices, only to own the underlying technology, with a contract with oems to only support their os / firmware. google via android, but more possessive.side note 2: regarding microsoft, this will be a sooner ar/vr bet. i work in semi conductor, and all major oem suppliers are pushing remote ar/vr servicing and support. microsoft are likely to capture this market.

2758,"been debating switching to bitcoin. especially with the rise in socialism it looks like america is going to become the next venezuela or zimbabwe. and with rising inflation, $1 today may be worth .01 cents tomorrow. also, all of the companies on the stock market are centralized so even if the stock market has high returns than the dollar it will the centralized companies will go down if the dollar goes down too. also, with the state of the hiring market, even before coronavirus it also shows that most of these companies aren't really here for the people and just want to capitalize while they take the time you use working for them that you could be using to better yourself, and they're using your time for their profit. whereas, cryptocurrency is for the people.as an argument, some people say some of the altcoins are scams, or they're too volatile. the way i look at it, is it's similar to bartering days of medieval and earlier times where people didn't work 40 hour weeks. where people worked by performing services for the community instead of working a set number of hours for one company. so they may spend a few hours farming, and maybe two hours building a house or making clothes etc. the people then exchanged those goods using gold, silver, hell even tulips (which you could say is like some altcoins). however, gold and silver are outdated and mainly only boomers buy gold and silver now. the main problem with gold and silver is you hypothetically could use it trade for something, but then you'd be like what now i'm just stuck with this block of gold that sits there and does nothing. whereas, bitcoin and altcoins are algorithms set in the blockchain that are efficient and don't require human labor to produce as gold does. so, bitcoin and other coins aer a set exchange rate that cannot be manipulated by crooked banks or work labor as in fiat currency, or through hard labor like gold, silver, palladium, oil, and other commodities.basically, the way i see it is gold, oil, silver will remain flat with a few ups and downs, but it will barely move. stocks, will have periods of ecstatic irrationality; however, even though it looks like they're a better bet than the dollar, a lot of stocks will still move down with the price of a dollar. also, when you're investing in stock it still feels like your investing in a company whose main goal is profit, and it doesn't incentivize the company to hire more people, it doesn't help the community, and heck it doesn't even confirm if the shareholders value will go up because the company could be mismanaging funds. also, like many tech companies they can make a lot of revenue, but it seems so many of them can't produce a profit because they're so poorly managed. it makes me think if they treat their employees this bad and they can't produce a profit, why would it make sense to invest in them?bitcoin seems like it promotes equality the most out of all of them. however, i feel the normal society will never catch on because they are asleep. also, i don't think the lawmakers would ever enact a change to get rid of a 40 hour work week and go back to a bartering model. it also, opens up too much litigation due to scammers, unproven models, and false claims of operating schemes by coin operators. this may cause governments to centralize models which would reduce the whole point of bitcoin and just turn it into another commodity like gold, silver, etc. is it worth it to get into bitcoin with inflation running up, or is it really a scam and too volatile like most people say?",5,0,Switch to bitcoin from stocks?,Finance

in a matter of 2 weeks in sep the spx lost 9.6% and the $nasx 11.8%. the total put call ratio is usually above 1, because it includes open interest of not just stocks , but also includes index and etf options. and it’s not because there are more shorts than longs, it’s because more traders need to hedge their positions and buying an index, or an etf put is one of the cheapest ways to do so. this too indicated an overbought market with data points of [0.65 to 0.68](https://markets.cboe.com/us/options/market_statistics/daily/?mkt=cone&amp;dt=2020-12-08). the lowest this ratio had reached in 2020 was in the last week of february, around the pre-covid peak.# the week ahead**stimulus and vaccine priced in**: yes, the vaccine will help return us to a new normal, but we still have to navigate a holiday season of travel and social interaction which will make an already macabre season of 235,000 daily new cases and almost 3,000 deaths, worse in the next 3 weeks. i believe that the vaccine and the stimulus is priced in and getting to new highs from here is going to be much more difficult.the ipo euphoria of airbnb and doordash shows a very speculative and overbought market.barron’s has a great story on why this is looking a lot like 1999, and one should read this article in its entirety to get what a sense of euphoria looked like.

3522,"note: i originally posted this on r/dividends so the writing caters more towards dividends but can be applied to general investing. mods hope that’s cool!i occasionally lurked the dividends sub and one thing i noticed was how many stocks are in people’s portfolios. throwing most of your money into 30+ random companies after googling “dividend kings” or “stocks with the highest dividends” is not what dividends are about. dividends are passive income in form of passive investing. when you pick stocks you get a shot of dopamine. dopamine is the “reward” neurotransmitter that tells our brains we want more; yet every substance or behavior that releases dopamine in the extreme leads to addiction. you try to motivate yourself to constantly seek out that next dividend stock to add to your portfolio. you assume your picks can beat the market gains. this generally leads to a general depression of dopamine which is anxiety. you’re constantly checking your portfolio, your emotions get the best of you which clouds your judgement and you make some wrong picks. that “king” cut its dividends and now its price has pummeled, your reit no longer manages its buildings because there is no foot traffic, international ends up performing better next decade. there’s a reason why they say people who pick stocks don’t end up beating market returns.on the flip side, serotonin is the “contentment” neurotransmitter that tells our brains we don’t need any more. you’re invested in broad index funds. you don’t give a shit who increases/decreases their dividends or who goes bankrupt. you look at your portfolio maybe once every few months. while this is sound, the pressures of today’s society has made us actively seek receptors that makes this extremely difficult. you’re making progress but it’s slower than you imagined, you’re bored. you’re watching strangers on the internet make hundreds of thousands from just one play. you decide to ditch the course and go onto another path to end up losing it all.now that we’ve discussed dopamine vs serotonin portfolios here’s my personal take. my first year investing included stock picking, chasing yields, and high-risk get rich quick plays in a dopamine portfolio. after losing some of my hard earned money, i eventually switched to a serotonin portfolio consisting of exclusively index funds. after i reached my first 100k between my 401k, roth, and taxable i decided to do the math and i seen that i would still retire a multi-millionaire if i kept maxing out my 401k and roth every year with a 7% return since i started young. i’ve decided to use an approach where work income would go into my serotonin portfolio and income from bonuses or side hustles would go towards my dopamine portfolio. spend a couple years grinding my ass off to build that dopamine portfolio. got promotions, purchased a rental, delivered food, drove people around, etc. you’d be surprised how much money you can make on the side as long as you put the work in. i will knowledge that i had no social life at this stage of my life since i was addicted to making money, hence the dopamine so it does come with some drawbacks on your mental state. fast forward, now i’m sitting comfortably with a 200k+ portfolio. a majority of it is primarily in index funds, a couple thousand for day trading and options, and shares in apple and pepsi. looking to add jpm soon! i’m very selective when it comes to individual shares. not only do they have to have a dividend, but i have to support the company enough to where my minimum investment is 10k. i understand the risks of stock picking and if i lost my money, i’d be more devastated in the company not performing well/going under because i value them. i think this creates a good balance between dopamine and serotonin. you get the boring, old reliables and you also get the hot shots who can help you reach your goals faster as long as you don’t let them come too close to the sun. i personally think people should not pick stocks unless they have reached the first grueling 100k but it’s your money. do your dd and decide what aligns with your goals. my hopes were to introduce some science behind investing to new and veterans. i’m currently earning 4k almost 5k in dividends every year with 2%+ yield. as you can see i don’t chase yields. if my portfolio consisted of primarily high-yield dividend stocks my portfolio would not be where it’s at right now since i’d miss out on a historical bull run. anyways, my fingers are now getting tired. i hope you enjoyed reading my post as much as i enjoyed typing it.",9,1,Dopamine and Serotonin in Investing,Finance

3659,"https://www.lawfareblog.com/baidu-alibaba-and-tencent-escape-investment-banafter weeks of internal u.s. government deliberation, baidu, alibaba and tencent—the chinese internet giants also known as the “bat”—will remain available to american investors. the companies are symbols of china’s economic modernity and growth but are also accused of having links to the chinese military and state surveillance efforts. on jan. 7, reports surfaced that baidu, alibaba and tencent might be included on the trump administration’s growing list of entities off-limits to american investment. a week later, the companies were officially spared. recent reporting suggests that the treasury department’s concerns over investor sentiment and economic ripple effects outweighed the state department’s and pentagon’s worries about chinese civil-military “fusion.” while american entities owned only a tiny fraction of most of the companies banned so far, u.s.-based investors own one-third of alibaba and 12 percent of tencent. u.s. investors have poured $1.4 trillion into those two companies alone. the companies’ exclusion from the list may demarcate the upper bound of domestic dislocation that the trump administration was willing to weather to exclude chinese entities from u.s. markets. the considered action against baidu, alibaba and tencent stemmed from the executive order trump signed on nov. 13, 2020, prohibiting american investment in a group of chinese companies alleged to have inappropriate ties to the chinese military. compliance with the order has been confused, in part because of the vague criteria and subsequent treasury department memoranda. (bill bishop, author of the china-watchers’ newsletter sinocism, described the administration’s last few weeks of china policy as “a driverless clown car careening into a ditch.”) the effects of the administration’s decision-making process were on display in the new york stock exchange’s (nyse’s) attempt to comply with treasury guidance. on dec. 31, the nyse announced that it would delist chinese telecom companies’ american depositary receipts (adrs), one mechanism by which u.s. investors can easily own foreign stocks. the nyse reversed itself and then, a day later, reversed once more: the exchange finally halted trading of china mobile, china telecom and china unicom on jan. 11, and u.s. banks delisted their derivatives. since november, the list has grown to include some companies without direct military ties but with varying degrees of chinese communist party (ccp) affiliation. xiaomi, the world’s third-largest mobile phone manufacturer, is among the latest additions to the list of entities from which americans are required to divest. xiaomi’s ties to the chinese military are less well documented than other banned firms’. a recently drafted executive order would have expanded the criteria to any company under the “control and influence” of the ccp. given china’s state capitalist system, that would be a rather long list. the order was not signed prior to the expiration of trump’s term.on jan. 9, beijing issued new guidance to chinese firms, prohibiting them from complying with foreign sanctions that are “unjustified.” president biden’s team will have to decide whether to reverse, maintain or expand the trump administration’s exclusions of chinese companies.u.s. declassifies strategic framework for the indo-pacificin its last days, the trump administration declassified its 2018 “strategic framework for the indo-pacific,” 21 years ahead of schedule. on jan. 5, national security adviser robert o’brien ordered the declassification of the 10-page document, which outlines goals, interests and “lines of effort” to serve american interests in the region. publicly released on jan. 12, the framework posited that top security threats include beijing’s attempt to “dominate cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence and bio-genetics, and harness them in service of authoritarianism.” according to the framework, “chinese dominance in these technologies would pose profound challenges to free societies.” (left unstated is what such “dominance” entails.) another technological threat noted in the strategy is “china’s proliferation of its digital surveillance, information controls, and influence operations.” in response, the united states adopted the objective of “maintain[ing] american industry’s innovation edge vis-a-vis china.”according to analysts of sino-american relations, the u.s. framework was informed and driven in part by the china strategies of u.s. allies and partners, particularly japan, australia and india. one expert argues that while the document reveals the existence of a multifaceted u.s. strategy toward china, trump’s actions often defied the strategy outlined in the document. commentators view the declassification as an attempt to entrench trump’s tough-on-china stance, making it more difficult for president biden to shift course.in a regular press conference on jan. 15, a spokesperson for china’s foreign ministry called the declassification of the framework an attempt to “smear and contain china and undermine regional peace and stability.”chinese tech worker deaths spark outcry on working conditionsthe recent deaths of two employees of pinduoduo, a chinese e-commerce giant, sparked widespread public outcry against the cultures of overwork that exist in chinese technology companies and start-ups. on dec. 29, a pinduoduo worker in her 20s collapsed while walking home with colleagues in urumqi, the capital city of xinjiang. pinduoduo later confirmed her death but did not disclose the cause. on jan. 5, a pinduoduo worker in changsha, hunan province, died by suicide after asking for time off from the company. and a former alibaba employee self-immolated in protest over unpaid wages. the video of his self-injury has gone viral on chinese social media in recent days. another former pinduoduo employee claims he was fired after posting a photo of a colleague being carried into an ambulance on jan. 7. (pinduoduo disputes the reason for the firing.) the photo and the employee’s associated claims of harsh work requirements went viral on weibo, reigniting public criticism of the chinese tech sector’s controversial “996” work culture. the term “996” refers to the tacit expectation that employees work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. the 996 office schedule has been endorsed by tech billionaires including alibaba founder jack ma and jd.com chief richard liu, who view the practice as necessary for survival in a highly competitive industry. but the chinese public, particularly younger generations, are critical of the culture of overwork. a hashtag about the pinduoduo employees’ deaths drew more than 260 million views on weibo. chinese state media, rather than cracking down on public backlash against pinduoduo, has allowed criticism to spread online. china’s state news agency, xinhua, called for shorter work hours in the country’s tech sector in an editorial on weibo. the ccp’s flagship newspaper, the people’s daily, also condemned the excessive 996 overtime practices as unfair to employees.the criticisms come at a time when china’s technology champions are already under fire for other business practices. chinese regulators have launched an antitrust probe into one of its biggest e-commerce companies and have passed new financial regulations on firms involved in online lending. some commentators think the recent employee deaths and associated public outcry give beijing “timely and very visceral publicity which it can leverage to further its policy objectives.” china’s state-run cctv published a commentary calling for authorities to increase regulatory oversight of pinduoduo and other tech companies to protect workers’ rights. the shanghai municipal human resources and social security bureau has pledged to open an investigation into pinduoduo’s labor practices over the employee deaths.after news of the first pinduoduo employee’s death, the company’s stock fell by 6.1 percent.",5,1,"After weeks of internal U.S. government deliberation, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent—the Chinese internet giants also known as the “BAT”—will remain available to American investors.",Finance

because even though other shops may sell coffee for less or people may be out of money, the rich love starbucks and those who will be hurt by the economy will need a cheap ""pick-me-up"". so instead of the $2000 plasma tv, they will buy the 4 dollar coffee. of course, all of this rest on the hope that they will stop building more. because that is what is killing their profit margin.ford motor company - f ..........6.72..........6.70..........13.36 (2020 $9.24)i like underdogs. i think ford still has potential it just needs a kick in the head. i think they will shape up and realize that america no longer desires gas guzzling suv. or the ""eco-friendly"" hype will fade and people will start buying gas guzzlers again. either way, ford has been losing for a long time. they only have two choices now, go bankrupt or get their act together and excel.flextronics international ltd. - flex ..........11.04.........12.12..........6.82 (2020 $16.71)this one relates to magazines picks. money magazine picked pemco aviation group, inc. - pagi - as a winner back in early 2007. i took a look at the stock and saw that they were already running on high times. did some research and found one of their competitors, flex, which hadn't had a winning stride in awhile. pemco has since tanked. flex has held it's ground and is slowly going up.ferro corporation - foe ..........21.58.........21.17..........7.05 (2020 $14.56)over a ten year period of past performance, i felt that now was the time for ferro to regain its formal potential. it's a nice game of wait and see.general electric company - ge ..........35.80(37.21).........37.34..........21.50 (2020 $10.15)all you ever hear about these days is the success of ge. with our obsession with alternative energy and ge's willingness to explore, i can't see how they can lose.insite vision, inc. - isv ..........1.44........0.88..........0.32 (2020 n/a)this is my million dollar stock. i'm counting on it skyrocketing around 2009. that or bankrupting tomorrow.sun microsystems, inc. - java ..........6.28..........18.21  (2020 n/a)i will probably be selling sun micro very soon. it has done well for me. i need to research some more on it.northgate minerals corporation - nxg ......... 3.08(3.23).........3.08..........3.49 (2020 n/a)all other companies in this sector seemed to be rising. except northgate. i don't really understand why, but i am hoping it gets with the program soon. i'd like to sell this one soon. i don't see much long term potential in it.origin agritech ltd. - seed ..........7.20..........7.17..........1.75 (2020 $9.55)i just found this stock recently and am hoping it may be a short affair that i can get out of on the top. according to research, it seems they like to pick up every other year. 2008 will be that year.t. rowe price group, inc. - trow .......... 46.61.........60.18..........76.29 (2020 $145.50)we are all becoming more investment savvy. and with the destruction of social security we are seeing more people relying on their own means to retire. this is one of the trusted companies that doesn't seem to be engaged in any scandals nor mortage woes. but it is also at the peak. gonna be time to get out soon.american express company - axp ..........63.04.........50.84..........67.45 (2020 $119.93)american express is one of those companies that doesn't rely so much on apr but more on annual charges. with all of the debt woes and defaults on credit cards and mortgages more people will flow to their cards. they also have  more financial savvy customers who can and will pay their bills on time.boston scientific corp. - bsx ........... 16.15.........11.72..........7.35 (2020 $33.65)pharma stocks will be king in 2008. and every four years this stock rises. 2008 is the fourth year.citigroup inc. - c ..........33.96 ............29.29..........46.46 (2020 $55.47)don't buy them now. they have a looooooong way to go to the bottom. but once they hit, i think this company has the greatest potential to get through the muck and mess to rise again. i'll be there waiting when the time comes. late 2008/early 2009.depomed, inc. - depo .......... 4.30 .......... 3.26..........5.45 (2020 n/a)over a ten year period this stock has its perks and its lows. the perks have been low and the lows have been lowest. i am counting on the next 5 years to be extra perky and full of higher lows.genentech, inc. - dna .......... 76.97 .......... 67.51..........???

4859,"the trump administration is considering adding tech giants alibaba and tencent to a blacklist of firms allegedly owned or controlled by the chinese military, two people familiar with the matter said on wednesday.targeting asia’s two most valuable companies would be u.s. president donald trump’s most dramatic step yet in a recent raft of measures unleashed against chinese companies as he seeks to cement his hardline policy against beijing during his final days in office.defense department officials, who oversee the blacklist designations, have not yet finalized plans and are also discussing adding other chinese firms to the list, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private.both companies declined to comment. the discussions were first reported by the wall street journal.shares in alibaba, china’s biggest e-commerce firm, finished down 3.9% on the hong kong stock exchange while tencent, a gaming and social media behemoth, lost 4.7%. alibaba’s u.s.-listed shares closed down just over 5% on the news on wednesday.some investors expressed skepticism, however, that alibaba and tencent would face long-term restrictions - given that they are worth a combined $1.3 trillion, widely held by u.s. investors and the likely reputational and financial hit to u.s. stock markets.“it’s a very bad policy and there’s enough money in asia, lots and getting bigger, that one shouldn’t force these companies out of america,” said thomas caldwell, chairman of caldwell investment management in toronto and an investor in the new york stock exchange. “money and markets should be neutral.”source: [reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-alibaba-tencent-iduskbn29c04y)",83,1,"U.S. considering adding Alibaba, Tencent to China investment ban",Finance

5177,"[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-27/ant-turning-from-windfall-to-nightmare-for-its-global-investors](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-27/ant-turning-from-windfall-to-nightmare-for-its-global-investors)**full text:**  two months ago, global investors were on the cusp of embracing a windfall from what would have been the world’s largest initial public offering. now, returns on the hundreds of millions of dollars invested with ant group co. are in jeopardy.china ordered ant to reexamine its fintech businesses -- spanning from wealth management to consumer credit lending and insurance -- and return to its roots as a payments service.while the central bank’s statement on sunday was short on specifics, it presents a serious threat to the growth and most lucrative operations of billionaire jack ma’s online finance empire. regulators stopped short of asking directly for a breakup of the company, yet stressed it was important ant “understand the necessity of overhauling its business” and told it to come up with a plan and timetable as soon as possible.authorities also berated ant for sub-par corporate governance, disdain toward regulatory requirements, and engaging in regulatory arbitrage. the central bank said ant used its dominance to exclude rivals, hurting the interests of its hundreds of millions of consumers.ant said in response that it will set up a special team to comply with regulators’ demands. it will maintain business operations for users, vowing not to increase prices for consumers and financial partners, while stepping up risk controls.the hangzhou-based firm needs to set up a separate financial holding company to comply with rules and ensure it has sufficient capital, regulators added.here are some of the scenarios from investors and analysts on what the restructuring could look like:**mild**optimists say regulators are merely re-asserting their right to oversee the country’s financial sector, sending a warning to the internet companies without intentions of drastic change.beijing could be trying to make an example out of ma’s ant, the largest among a raft of new but pervasive fintech platforms. past crackdowns of this nature have dealt short-term blows to companies, leaving them mostly unscathed. social media giant tencent holdings ltd., for instance, became a prominent target of a campaign to combat gaming addiction among children in 2018. while its shares took a hit, they eventually recovered to all-time highs.ant’s affiliate, alibaba group holding ltd., similarly regained the confidence of investors after short-run selloffs following accusations by authorities on everything from unfairly squeezing merchants to turning a blind eye to fakes on its e-commerce platform.“i don’t think regulators are thinking of breaking up ant, as no fintech company in china has a monopoly status,” said zhang kai, an analyst at market research firm analysys ltd. “the act is not just targeting ant but also sending out a warning to other chinese fintech companies.”some see it as an opportunity for ant. with the industry as a whole facing tougher oversight, ant has more resources to cope with the challenges as an industry leader, said zhang.**bad**a more troubling outcome would be if regulators moved to break up ant group. that would complicate the shareholder structure, and hurt the company’s fastest-growing businesses.valued at about $315 billion before its initial public offering was halted, ant corralled investments from the world’s biggest funds. among them: warburg pincus llc, carlyle group inc., silver lake management llc, temasek holdings pte and gic pte.the global investors backed the company when it was valued at about $150 billion in its last round of fundraising in 2018. a break-up would make the return on their investments uncertain, with the timeline for an ipo that was due in november now pushed into the distant future.the government could ask ant to spin off its more lucrative operations in wealth management, credit lending and insurance, offloading them into a financial holding company that will face tougher scrutiny.“the emerging reality is china’s regulators are adopting similar regulation toward banks and fintech players,” said michael norris, research and strategy manager at shanghai-based consultancy agencychina.ant’s payments business alone leaves much less to the imagination. while the service handled $17 trillion of transactions in one year, online payments have largely been loss-making. the two biggest mobile payments operators, ant and tencent, have heavily subsidized the businesses, using them as a gateway to win over users. to make money, they leveraged the payments services to cross sell products including wealth management and credit lending.“ant’s growth potential will be capped with the focus back onto its payments services,” said chen shujin, a hong kong-based head of china financial research at jefferies financial group inc. “on the mainland, the online payments industry is saturated and ant’s market share pretty much reached its limit.”**nightmare**the worst case scenario would be for ant to forgo its money management, credit and insurance businesses, halting its operations in the units that service half a billion people.its wealth management business which includes the yu’ebao platform that sells mutual funds and money market funds, accounted for 15% of revenue.credit tech, which includes ant’s huabei and jiebei units, was the biggest revenue driver for the group, contributing 39% of the total in the first six months this year. it made loans to about 500 million people.that outcome would be underpinned by the idea that china’s leaders have grown frustrated with the swagger of tech billionaires and want to teach them a lesson by killing off their businesses -- even if it means short-term pain for the economy and markets.china’s private sector has maintained a delicate relationship with the communist party for decades, and has only recently been recognized as central to the nation’s future. many commentators have attributed the recent crackdown on fintech companies to remarks ma made at a conference in october, when he decried attempts to rein in the burgeoning field as short-sighted and outmoded.between them, alibaba, ant and tencent commanded a combined market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion in november, surpassing state-owned behemoths such as bank of china ltd. as the country’s most valuable companies.the trio have invested billions of dollars in hundreds of up-and-coming mobile and internet companies, gaining kingmaker status in the world’s largest smartphone and internet market by users.“the communist party is the end-all and the be-all in china. it controls everything,” said alex capri, a singapore-based research fellow at the hinrich foundation. “there is nothing that the chinese communist party doesn’t control and anything that does appear to be gyrating out of its orbit in any way is going to get pulled back very quickly,” he said, adding “we can expect to see more of that.”",15,1,Ant Turning From Windfall to Nightmare for Its Global Investors,Finance

5460,"let’s say you have $1 million in your retirement account and retire at 65. to be safe you have 500k in stocks and 500k in safe investments solely for the purpose of keeping up with inflation. for the first 10 years you only take from the safe investment while your stocks grow for 10 years. you could take out 50k (5%) every  year plus interest to match inflation. on average the stock market doubles (inflation included) every 10 years. so on average after 10 years you have ran through your safe investment allocation (500k at 50k per year again) and your stock allocation had doubled to 1m. you split this into a 50/50 allocation again and continue this forever. now of course the stock market could do worse than average however historically at worst with dividends reinvested you probably won’t go far below staying even. even in that case which i believe has only happened twice over a decade period, you would still be sitting at 500k and you are 75 years old. a 50/50 split again and taking out 50k would get you another 5 years unaltered withdrawals and at 80 you are left with whatever 250k grew to over 5 years after a pretty historic bad decade so it’s not unlikely you’d have some pretty big gains. at this point you are also 85 and expenses are down plus you probably have some social security as a safety net. anything wrong in these assumptions?",1,1,"The typical advice for retirement is 3-4% withdrawal rule, from what I can tell though, 5% should be pretty safe?",Finance

19, 2021** **•** [**tracey longo**](https://www.fa-mag.com/author/2369/tracey_longo)president-elect joe biden’s promise to tax the wealthy may include a tax on dividends, something made easier now that democrats hold the house and the slimmest majority possible in the senate.the biden administration has called for those making more than $1 million to pay the same rate on investment income that they do on their wages. investment income includes dividends and capital gains.but an earlier biden plan for financing health-care initiatives indicates the new president will tax long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the new top ordinary income tax rate of 39.6% on income above $1 million and eliminate the step-up in basis that allows decedents to pass capital gains to heirs without taxes.advertisementthat means the top rate on long-term capital gains would nearly double from 23.8% to 43.4%. biden’s campaign cites a joint committee on taxation report on tax expenditures which estimates that the special lower rate on capital gains and dividends reduces federal revenue by $127 billion each, according to scott eastman, a policy analyst at the tax foundation, an independent tax policy nonprofit.the change would have a significant tax impact on wealthy investors. “we estimate the plan would increase the average tax rate on capital gains from 19.1% to 27.7%, and the marginal tax rate on capital gains from 22.4% to 33.4%,” eastman said.while the revenue estimate implies that the government loses a lot of revenue from the lower rate on capital gains, it is “highly unlikely” the federal government could get this much revenue from just raising the rate, eastman cautioned. research from the congressional budget office (cbo) and the joint committee on taxation (jct) shows that taxpayer capital gains realizations are very sensitive to taxation.“this is because taxpayers can time when they want to realize their capital gains in order to minimize their tax bills,” eastman said. “specifically, the cbo and jct estimate that the elasticity of realizations to the tax rate is -1.2 in the short run and -0.79 in the long run. specifically, a 1% increase in the capital gains tax rate would result in a 0.79 to 1.2% drop in capital gains realizations.“in practice, this means that proposals to significantly raise capital gains tax rates, with no other changes, can lose federal revenue,” he added. “using cbo data on capital gains realizations and these elasticities, we estimate that raising the top rate to 43.4% could lose about $2 billion each year.”eastman said he arrived at that top rate by combining the 39.6% statutory rate plus the 3.8% net investment income tax.however, biden is not simply proposing to raise the top rate on capital gains. he also proposes eliminating step-up basis in capital gains. according to the jct, not taxing gains at death results in an annual loss of about $40 billion.again, this is a tax expenditure estimate and not a revenue estimate, and the amount of revenue biden’s proposal would ultimately raise would depend on how he structures the elimination of the step-up in basis, eastman said.biden “could require heirs to take on the decedent’s basis when they receive an asset, known as carryover basis, but still allow heirs to defer realization of that inherited asset’s capital gain,” eastman said. “this would raise much less than making death a taxable event—and even then, proposals to tax capital gains at death can have many exemptions.”it is also important to note how the two proposals interact. “since biden is raising the tax rate on capital gains, the value of the tax expenditure for step-up in basis will mechanically increase. this is because the rate at which these gains would otherwise be taxed at would be higher,” eastman said.in addition, eliminating step-up in basis at death reduces a taxpayers’ incentive to defer realizing gains. part of the reason why there is such a strong incentive to defer the tax on capital gains is that if an individual defers long enough, the tax on the asset will eventually be forgiven, eastman said.without step-up in basis, a taxpayer has a greater incentive to realize the gain during their lifetime. as such, eliminating step-up in basis can indirectly boost revenue from capital gains.while the plan will raise additional federal revenue in a progressive manner, it isn’t costless. raising taxes on capital gains would reduce the incentive to save by reducing the after-tax return to saving.“lower domestic saving leads to lower income for americans in the future and can lead to lower output by reducing domestic investment,” eastman said. “in addition, there are administrative, structural and transition issues that biden needs to consider if he ultimately eliminates step-up in basis,”while it is premature to make predictions about what biden and his democratic-majority congress will do, biden has stated plainly that he wants to raise tax revenues by $3.3 trillion over the next decade.“on a conventional basis, the biden tax plan by 2030 would lead to about 7.7% less after-tax income for the top 1% of taxpayers and about a 1.9% decline in after-tax income for all taxpayers on average,” according to tax foundation analysis.in addition to the potential new tax rates for those earning $1 million or more, biden’s plan also seeks to impose a 12.4% social security payroll tax on income earned above $400,000, evenly split between employers and employees. this would create a “donut hole” in the current social security payroll tax, where wages between $137,700, the current wage cap, and $400,000 are not taxed.=================",37,1,Biden may tax dividends and double the tax on long-term

5803,"idk if this a tangent or unrelated to this sub but me and my friends were talking about the idea of a ""fintech startup"" based off of buying credit card debt directly off of people and then offering them reasonable interest rates based off of some magic machine learning/big data model. i guess something along the lines of lending club. we even included blockchain as somewhat of a joke to get more vc funding.so then i go down the rabbit hole of debt buyers. on wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debt\_buyer\_(united\_states)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/debt_buyer_(united_states))) there's trillions of dollars of credit card debt floating about, yet the debt buying industry is ""13.7 billion dollars "" (in 2017), which seems small for an entire industry like this.even the debt they own is minuscule compared to the total debt that most americans own. i understand that they make their business mainly through buying the debt from banks of people the banks feel like are a ""lost cause"" and essentially just want a write off.encore financial group ([https://www.encorecapital.com/](https://www.encorecapital.com/)) one of the biggest of these entities  and is also publicly traded, yet it's revenues globally are around $1 billion dollars with a similar market cap. it's not like they lose money; they market a profit and, i know this is being based on robinhood analysts ratings, is a strong buy. they have subsidiaries like midland credit management ([https://www.midlandcredit.com/](https://www.midlandcredit.com/)) which offer services directly to individuals. their stock is up 89% over the past 5 years, but over the past 3 it's down 19%. they even have this message of social responsibility that would look great on any pitch deck ([https://www.encorecapital.com/social-responsibility-and-sustainability/](https://www.encorecapital.com/social-responsibility-and-sustainability/)). compare this to stripe, another fintech company. i know they do something completely different (payment processing) , but their revenue is like 4 times that of encore and is valued at like $35 billion (potentially). i realize it has to do with stripe's genius idea of an integrated ecosystem and it's like comparing apples to oranges, but why is stripe more-so of a household name than something like midland that offers (on paper) an extremely appealing alternative to crippling debt or declaring personal bankruptcy?i guess my question boils down to: why isn't the debt buying sector ""worth"" more to investors? is it because of the lack of growth or potential growth? thin returns? big initial costs? regulations? and is this space ripe for any possible disruption from startups?",10,1,Debt buyers: why aren't they worth more?,Finance
5845,"i’d be interested in thoughts on netflix’s future viability amongst the facebook, apple, amazon, google (alphabet) + microsoft line-up; in particular, does anyone else think netflix could eventually be bought out?while there’ve been a lot of posts on facebook as the least viable of the faang - citing almost endless litigation and civil liberties infringements, and public opinion (in the us, and europe) turning against them - at their core, fb is no longer just the facebook platform. while it remains possible that another social media platform could come and topple facebook and instagram, and another messaging service could take the place of whatsapp, and despite potentially much tighter data legislation, that isn’t all fb is. there’s their foray into gaming (oculus, zynga mobile gaming), and their competition in the local marketplace space (against the likes of craigslist/gumtree, and ebay increasingly - not amazon). it seems likely they’ll continue to diversify their business model away from the “core” social media platform. and, as much as straw polling people suggests a lot have moved away from it... is there a real competitor? amazon remains a money printing machine, with aws also a huge earner. apple continues to have a very loyal fan base, and looks to encroach more into the business space microsoft has always dominated. both have also launched their own streaming services - admittedly without the interface or adoption of netflix. they, together with google, continue pumping money into innovation. microsoft remains a sleeping giant, still with a firm grasp of office computing and gaming.it would almost surprise me if google and microsoft didn’t launch their own streaming services, at some point. they‘ve certainly got the capital. which leaves the question - beyond a (very successful, and still increasing) subscription model, and (loss making) ability to acquire new content - coupled with a best-on-the-market user interface - what does netflix’s future expansion look like? the rest of the faang(+m) have shown an ability to make solid acquisitions and continue diversifying the areas they dominate. can netflix realistically do this, or are they likely to end up bought out or collapsed?there’s also frequent talk of faang(+m) stock as “overpriced”, and the (valid) argument that r&amp;d is priced in. even so, netflix’s current price is double facebook and apple (admittedly, post a share split), and triple microsoft’s - is nflx able to continue to hold this valuation, with existing streaming services like disney+, apple tv and amazon with the capital to improve; and others with the potential to enter the market?",21,1,FAANG (+M) - will NFLX be consumed by one of the others?,Finance
5847,"hi everyone,i work as a product manager at a large tech company and as part of my job it's important for me to understand major technology trends and strategies. i put this post together to outline a major new 'moat' strategy being used by some of the world's best saas companies. i've also highlighted some of the best related investment opportunities.if you found this post valuable and would like to read more please let me know. i'm thinking about writing like this more often if it's something people get value from. thanks a lot# the lock-expand-improve strategyin 2016, instagram launched their ‘stories’ feature. instagram stories was an almost direct copy of snapchat stories (even copying the name). whatever your opinion on such a move, it has most definitely paid off. by 2019, the daily active user count for instagram stories was twice as high as snapchat’s total dau count.building great software is still one of the most important things that software companies should be focused on. but it’s not enough. in a world where your best features can (and will) be copied, companies need to focus on building a strong economic moat around their business.first coined by warren buffett, an economic moat is a company’s ability to build and maintain a durable competitive advantage while protecting its long-term profits and market share.&gt;“the most important thing \[is\] trying to find a business with a wide and long-lasting moat around it … protecting a terrific economic castle with an honest lord in charge of the castle,” - buffetti believe that there are 3 ‘types’ of moats in particular that when built together by tech companies, will compound upon each other to create a hugely defensible business. this business strategy will be one of the most important strategies of the next 10 years. companies who can successfully execute on this strategy will dominate their markets and deliver outsized returns to their investors.i call this moat strategy the **lock-expand-improve** strategy.in this post, i’ll first briefly explain some of the traditional moats currently seen in tech companies. then i’ll go into detail on the lock-expand-improve strategy. finally, i’ll highlight a few tech companies that i think are best positioned to execute on this strategy and therefore make for great investment opportunities.## traditional business moats* **deep technology/ip:** sometimes, companies can build a massive economic moat by having deep technology that is at least 10 times better than the competition. google’s search engine is the classic example of this. google joined the search wars somewhat late but had a solution that was far better than yahoo’s.* **economies of scale:** the bigger your are, the lower your costs will be due to having more operating leverage. this means that you can earn more money per customer (at the same price) or provide a cheaper solution than your smaller competitors. software companies in general are great examples of economies of scale due to the almost zero additional cost of production involved in acquiring another customer.* **network effects:** your product/service has network effects if its value increases as the number of people using it increases. social networks and messaging products are classic examples of network effects. network moats can be incredibly defensible. why would i download a new messaging app when all of my friends are using whatsapp?* **brand loyalty:** a strong brand can be a moat. think apple, coca-cola, gucci. instantly recognisable brands that have built huge businesses by cultivating brand loyalty amongst their customers.the above moats have built some of the biggest and most enduring tech companies in the world. google, amazon and facebook all have one or more of those moats. but many of these moats can become shallow over time. for example, network effects have been key to facebook’s success. the more users that use facebook, the better facebook becomes for each individual user (to an extent). however, facebook’s network effects don’t stop users from adopting and using other social networks.major platform shifts/trends can also make some moats a lot more shallow. the emergence of open-source software has made deep tech a far shallower moat in many instances.today, for tech companies to build a truly durable competitive advantage they need more than one moat. these moats should also compound upon each other. the whole should be greater than the sum of its parts.enter the lock-expand-improve moat strategy.## lock-expand-improvebefore explaining the lock-expand-improve strategy, it’s important to note that this strategy is focused on b2b/enterprise software companies. while aspects of this strategy could most likely be useful for companies in other industries/verticals, i’ll only be highlighting investment opportunities in the b2b/enterprise space.the most important thing to note about this strategy is that it is a compounding moat strategy. this means two things:1. each step of the strategy must be in place for it to be successful.2. each step builds upon the previous step to allow companies to build a stronger competitive advantage over time.while traditional moats allow companies to focus on protecting and improving their castle (business), these moats can get shallower over time. the lock-expand-improve strategy allows companies not only to to protect and improve their castles but also to ***dig a deeper and wider moat over time.***## step 1: lock-inthe first two steps of this strategy are similar to the popular ‘land and expand’ strategy.the first step, lock-in (or high switching costs), involves making it very difficult for your customers to switch to a competitor. here are some of the ways that software companies can achieve customer lock-in:1. **high sunk costs:** high sunk costs are a common feature of major erp-style businesses such as servicenow or oracle. implementing these products can cost millions of dollars and take months to years. once a customer has put that much time and effort into implementing your product, they will be far less likely to switch to a competitor.2. **deep integrations:** if your product allows your customers to integrate with lots of other apps and data sources, it will be far harder for a company to switch to a competing product. they will not only have to replace your product but also replace all of the integrations that have been built up over time.3. **business logic and workflows:** you can build customer lock-in by being the product in which a lot of customer information, logic and workflows are stored. a good example of this is atlassian’s jira product. while the implementation costs for jira are low, a huge amount of organisational logic and process gets stored in jira over time, making it difficult to replace.## step 2: expandonce you have achieved customer lock-in, the next step is to expand into other product areas and use cases. the goal is to solve more problems and sell more relevant products to each individual customer.this multi-product strategy is a really powerful way of building a strong moat around your business. even if the individual products are worse in isolation, the benefits of multi-product may far outweigh the negatives for customers.for example, a competitor may have built a sales analytics tool that is far better than salesforce’s analytics product. but a large customer is not comparing both analytics tools in isolation. a large customer is comparing your analytics tool against the fact that they can also get their crm, marketing and customer support software all from salesforce. one contract. one vendor relationship. one login for employees.## step 3: improve with dataonce a company has locked-in their customers and has expanded into new products, they can then begin collecting huge amounts of data about how their customers use their products.this final step of this strategy is the most important - using customer data to provide tangible benefits to those customers and significantly improve their businesses. there are two main ways that data can be used to benefit customers:1. ***focus on using the data from an individual customer to benefit that specific customer -*** companies can use an individual customer’s data to provide actionable insights to that customer to allow them to improve their businesses. for example, people.ai uses ml to help companies uncover new revenue opportunities. customer data can also be used to automate specific, repetitive tasks for customers. for example, uipath (can’t wait for their ipo) provides rpa solutions to allow customers to automate repetitive tasks.2. ***focus on using the data from all customers to benefit the entire customer ecosystem -*** google is a great example of a company that uses a data network effect to their advantage. the more search data they collect from all searches, the more accurate they can make searches in the future. we are beginning to see some enterprise software companies move in this direction. for example, servicenow provides benchmarking data to customers to allow them to compare themselves against industry standards and improve their business from there.artificial intelligence and machine learning have been buzzwords in the software world for quite a while. up until now, we haven’t seen huge benefits from ai/ml strategies in b2b/enterprise software. i strongly believe that this is beginning to change. we are starting to see the big incumbents build or acquire meaningful data solutions (eg salesforce acquiring tableau). companies that can leverage ai/ml to do meaningful and useful things with their customer’s data will have a huge advantage over their competition.## the flywheelyou can see how the lock-expand-improve strategy has such a compounding effect. by first locking in a customer, you can expand into new products, which allows you to then collect as much data as possible. once you are collecting this data, you can then begin to use this data to provide big tangible benefits to your customers. these benefits mean your customers will be even less likely to switch to a competitor (lock-in) which will allow you to expand into even more products and collect even more data. the flywheel continues.that is what’s so powerful about this strategy - where many traditional moats get shallower over time, the flywheel effect makes this economic moat even deeper and wider over time.## investment opportunities*(\*\*\*please note, that this post does not represent investment advice and these are just the companies that i'm excited about for my personal portfolio)*while there are many b2b/enterprise tech companies that have successfully executed on the first 2 steps of this strategy (lock and expand) and there are a number of companies placing a huge amount of focus on step 3 (improving with data), there are no companies who i feel have fully executed on this strategy in it’s entirety.from an investing perspective, the opportunity lies in identifying companies who are best positioned to (and would benefit most from) successful execute the lock-expand-improve strategy. below are 3 such companies that i am incredibly bullish on.## okta ($okta):okta is an identity management company that provides identity services such as single sign on and user authentication. they are perfectly positioned to execute on the lock-expand-improve strategy.okta has incredibly high lock-in properties. once a product is managing your sso, user authentication and provisioning services, it is not easy to replace. the switching costs are high both in terms of the amount of core business logic managed by the platform and the amount of integrations to other software products.okta is successfully executing on the expansion aspect of this strategy too. they have moved into products such as api management and now have two major product areas; workforce identity management and customer identity management.i believe okta has a huge opportunity to double down on their data initiatives and to truly start to help their customers to improve. they have already started doing so with their “okta insights” product which provides analytics and tailored recommendations to okta customers. these products seem to be mostly focused on user security but imagine the further opportunities here - we are seeing an explosion in the number of saas products being used internally by companies. okta is the single source of truth for companies to understand their saas usage, spend etc. okta has a huge opportunity to leverage this information to help their customers choose the right tools, reduce unnecessary it spend and much more.okta is already the leader in the identity management space. if they continue to focus on their data strategy over the next few years then i firmly believe that the lock-expand-improve flywheel will begin turning and they will fully cement that position.## twilio ($twlo)twilio provides communication apis that allows companies to engage/communicate with customers over multiple channels such as sms and whatsapp.api products have very high lock-in characteristics. the more services that twilio allows you to integrate with, the harder it becomes to switch to a competitor.twilio is expanding into new product areas very successfully. they have expanded into new communications use cases such as video messaging and recently launched a programmable call centre product - twilio flex.what’s most interesting about twilio is its data strategy. up until 2020, they didn’t seem to have much of a data focus. but their recent acquisition of segment looks set to change all that. segment allows customers to make data-driven decisions around engineering and marketing., allowing them to improve their businesses over time. the segment acquisition was a brilliant move. it makes twilio’s position far more defensible. the flywheel effect could be very powerful here; twilio already has high lock-in and is expanding aggressively, the segment acquisition allows them to focus on helping their customers to improve their businesses through data.## stripeokay, i know - stripe isn’t public. but i couldn’t help including them here. they look likely to go public in the few years and in my opinion are perfectly positioned to execute on the lock-expand-improve strategy.stripe’s product has high lock-in properties, they are expanding aggressively into other product areas and have already built a very powerful data product - stripe radar which allows companies to detect and fight fraud.stripe has all

6438," **tl:dr is at the bottom**hello, welcome to my second deep dive write up.my   name’s mark and i’m an accountant with a passion for investing. about   two years ago, i used to work as an auditor at a public accounting firm   and have been behind the scenes at many different publicly traded and   privately held companies in the u.s. my goal is to bring my unique   perspective from that past experience, my current experience working in a   new role at a large corporation, and my understanding of accounting to   help break down some of the most exciting growth stocks on the market   today.i’m a long-term investor. i   am focused on finding great companies and holding them for a long  time.  i’m willing to endure volatility, crazy price drops, and  everything  that comes with this approach as long as the facts that led  me to  originally invest and believe in that company have not changed.  if you  want to learn more about this approach. i recommend reading the  book  “100 baggers” by chris mayer.**introduction**i’m   excited to share with you all my stock pick for this month,  smartsheet.  i’m always looking for investment ideas. i run stock  screeners with  different criteria (mostly focused on revenue growth),  scan twitter,  talk to professionals in different industries, and try to  observe what  products or services are getting popular with my friends  and family. one  of the best investment decisions i’ve made to date came  after i talked  to my friend about a drink he was drinking on the golf  course. shout out  to you celsius (celh)! with that being said, you  never know where your  next good investment idea is going to come from.in   the case of smartsheet, i became aware of the company through a stock   screener. i was drawn to the relatively small market cap ($8.6b),  strong  revenue growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a  subscription  business model (saas). once i became aware of these facts,  it cued me to  take a deeper dive. the more i learned about smartsheet,  the more i  liked. management talks a lot about empowering people and  that really  struck a chord with me. in different roles i’ve had as a  teacher, tutor,  and supervisor, i’ve always found empowering people to  be one of the  most important keys to success. i will touch on this more  later in the  write up.another  positive signal i  got about smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. i  was sitting in  the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. i was  watching an  interview on my phone with mark mader, the ceo of  smartsheet. my  girlfriend overheard the word “smartsheet” mentioned in  the video and  said “are they talking about the smartsheet with the blue  check mark?”. i  had to google their logo but yes, it turns out we were  thinking about  the same smartsheet. i asked her how she knew about it.  she said “my  company just transitioned all of our work onto  smartsheet. i really love  it. our marketing department is really  excited about it because it  makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” hearing this just  motivated me to learn more about  smartsheet.**the thesis statement**for   every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement   that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock   for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long   so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during  times  when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why   you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for smartsheet is as follows:*“smartsheet:   a leader in collaborative work management (cwm) software. as the  global  workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work,  managers and  executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally  consolidate their  teams, projects and deadlines. smartsheet is that  tool and is  innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the  most out of  their teams.”*i  think this  thesis statement really captures the essence of what  smartsheet does. if  you go to smartsheet’s website and look at the  “about” page, you will  find their “about” statement which says  “smartsheet is the enterprise  platform for dynamic work that aligns  people and technology so your  entire business can move faster, drive  innovation, and achieve more.”  notice how their statement emphasizes  helping businesses move faster,  drive innovation, and achieve more.in   my thesis statement, i mention that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm   software space. but how do i know this? well, a highly reputable   independent research firm named forrester conducted a study on the cwm   space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise   capabilities, ui/user experience, planned enhancements and number of   customers just to name a few of the factors considered. i put the   companies that were identified from the study in the order of their   ranking below. as you can see, smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader   in the space at 2nd place. let’s use our common sense for a second. at   the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest   in an up and coming saas company that focuses on providing firms with   resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage   work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? i think the   answer should be a resounding yes. but what about these other companies   on the list. let’s break them down 1 by 1:* workfront   was recently bought by adobe. if you want to invest in workfront,  you’d  have to invest in the much larger company of adobe. it wouldn’t  be a  pure play investment into the cwm space.* smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)* wrike is private* servicenow   – cwm is just one small piece of their total      offerings. investing   here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.  also, the company  is  already quite large ($106b market cap)* asana   is public but just ipo’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. we don’t have   much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company.   furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment  into  the cwm space, they’re not a leader and rank behind smartsheet in   several of forrester’s categories. why invest in the 2nd best when you   can invest in the best?* monday.com is private* microsoft – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.* atlassian   – this company does primarily focus on cwm but i have a couple  problems  with them as an investment. 1) they’re ranked way beneath  smartsheet.  2) they’re already too big for me to confidently say they  can 10x  (market cap already $58b).now   that we’ve established that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm space  and  that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play  investment  in this space let’s understand why this is important. other  than the  obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote  work  revolution, why is this important?well,   let’s take a look at this quote from mark mader, smartsheet ceo,  during  the last earnings call (q3 fy21) that occurred on december 7th,  2020:“leaders  are recognizing  they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work,  work that is  documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where  priorities  are clearly defined. they understand that by empowering their  teams  with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle  times  will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and   prioritization and accountability will be insured. smartsheet is   ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive   the benefits from doing so.”key word here: asynchronous. asynchronous communication is different from synchronous communication. here is the difference:asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc.synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc.any   communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be   considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above.   synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real   time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. as   part of my research on smartsheet, i read an e-book that was written by   the original co-founders of smartsheet, mark mader the current ceo and   brent frei who is no longer with the company. they wrote the e-book in   2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. the e-book is   called “the power of done”. the moral of the book is that mark and brent   noticed through their own experience, and through different research   studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the   early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. this   is a quote from their e-book:“according   to basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy,   interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging   and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized  basis,  this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire u.s.   workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the american economy.”they   mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances  in  work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets,  there  hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for  teamwork  collaboration or task management. the fact that technology  advances  helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also  deterred  productivity at the same time is what mark and brent referred  to as the  productivity paradox. they wanted to do something about it  and thus they  founded smartsheet.**how smartsheet makes money**at   the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand   how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that  i  mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth  as  one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this  isn’t  to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just  because it  has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a  growth stock  to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the  first things i  look at.before i  talk about the  revenue streams of smartsheet, i want to share a little  bit about the  actual product that they sell to earn this revenue.  co-founder/ceo mark  mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate  world was being done  on spreadsheets such as microsoft excel. however,  he realized that these  spreadsheets were largely static and not  necessarily used to their full  potential. he wanted to help people get  more out of their use of  spreadsheets. as a result, we now have  smartsheets which is a cloud  based platform that can be accessed by all  employees of the company no  matter where they are with live  information about project statuses,  meeting times and work that is  assigned to each employee just to name a  few uses. users can choose  their way of viewing this information with  different views such as  calendar view, grid view, card view, and gantt  view.the  idea is that by  enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous  information  available to all members of a team about the status of a  project, the  tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous  communication  will be needed which allows employees to spend more time  doing what  they’re hired to do – get work done. think about how  wasteful it is to  hire a highly talented engineer but then make him  spend half his day  preparing for and doing status update meetings and  hunting people down  to see where they’re at with their assignments.  what if all this  information was available for him, his managers, and  his staff to see  within smartsheet without having to bother each other  and waste precious  work hours that could be used for coding, designing,  and producing?  that’s what smartsheet looks to achieve.for   smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. as i  mentioned  earlier, they are a software as a service (saas) company.  whenever you  see saas, that means subscription revenue and in my  opinion that’s a  very good thing. with a subscription business model,  the revenue is  going to be recurring every year and that type of  reliability (combined  with growth of course) is something you want as  an investor.smartsheet’s  primary  source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their  cloud-based  collaborative work management (cwm) platform. customers and  potential  customers begin their engagement with the smartsheet platform  by either  signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the   smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to   smartsheet by collaborating with a company/individual that uses   smartsheet.  for subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets   their needs and can begin using smartsheet within minutes.smartsheet   offers four subscription levels: individual, business, enterprise, and   premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided.   customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration   and automation to third-party applications.the   connectors part of the business is something i find really  interesting.  basically, smartsheet has made deals with most of the top  work  productivity and communication software companies in the world to  allow  their customers to use those applications within their smartsheet  user  interface. this helps position smartsheet as the true “command  center”  platform while the products of the other companies become  ancillary  pieces. you’ll see this on the link above but some products  that  smartsheet sells connectors for include adobe creative cloud,  microsoft  dynamics 365, salesforce, jira software, slack, and skype  just to name a  few.i think that  being able to  sell these connectors as ancillary pieces to the  smartsheet user  experience is so beneficial to smartsheet because a lot  of these  companies that people may perceive as “smartsheet  competitors” actually  become a piece of the smartsheet platform and can  be sold by smartsheet  as a supplemental revenue stream. this neutral  angle that smartsheet is  able to come from by selling connectors to  their perceived “competitors”  reminds me a little bit of how roku  (roku) is able to earn revenue off  of selling a netflix subscription on  their platform. i think just the  fact that all these big companies  like adobe, jira, salesforce, etc.  allow their products to be  integrated into smartsheet shows that there  is a high value proposition  in the smartsheet platform and that they  would risk alienating their  customers if they didn’t allow for their  products to be integrated with  smartsheet.on  top of the  connectors to third party vendors that smartsheet is able to  sell,  smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal   plug-ins. smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can   sell to their customers. for example, in may 2019, smartsheet acquired   10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource   allocation and planning. the name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to   having a high level view of your company and all resources available   within your company and how to deploy them.also,   in september 2020, smartsheet acquired brandfolder, inc. which  provides  a centralized platform to organize, discover, control,  distribute, and  measure all forms of digital content. combining  brandfolder capabilities  with smartsheet allows them to create dynamic  solutions that manage  workflows around content and collaboration. this  goes back to what i  said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend  had mentioned that  her company’s marketing team was “really excited  about smartsheet  because it makes their job way easier and more  enjoyable.” she told me  that before smartsheet, her company’s marketing  team had to constantly  hunt down members of the creative team  (photographers, graphic  designers) to receive the latest photos,  videos, and digital designs  they were working on. she said it was a big  pain for them trying to  share this content over email and sharepoint.  now, all of the content is  inside of smartsheet and the marketing team  can access it at any time.  they can leave comments on the content,  route to appropriate individuals  for approvals, and have better insight  into the status of all digital  content that is being worked on. the  acquisition of brandfolder is  really what allows smartsheet to stand  out in this department.nobody   really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days   for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out   quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a   light as possible. the fact that smartsheet has a strong proprietary   plug-in for this with brandfolder is very promising. during smartsheet’s   fy21 engage customer conference, anna griffin, smartsheet chief   marketing officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500b   for companies around the world. she said the role of the marketing   department is changing from sole content creator to editor in chief. all   kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content  that  effects the company’s brand. sales is running social media  campaigns,  product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts,  and r&amp;d is  teasing new product experiences in app. it can get  really difficult for  the company’s marketing/branding team to stay on  top of all this  without a centralized digital content collaboration  platform like  brandfolder in smartsheet. this is just one reason why i  think  smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.as   you can see, smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their  core  cwm platform, the connectors they can sell, and the internal  upgrades  available such as 10,000ft and brandfolder. on top of that,  smartsheet  also provides workapps, a proprietary no-code platform that  empowers  users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that  streamline  business and simplify collaboration. there are so many  instances within  companies where an app needs to be built to streamline  a workflow.  traditionally, companies need to engage their it  departments and the  coders that sit within these departments to build  these apps. this  places a lot of strain on it departments and takes  away time they can be  spending on more complex/mission critical  projects. mark mader is aware  of this and thus is heavily pushing  no-code as a solution for companies  now and in the future. he believes  that everyday non-coder employees  know their jobs/workflows best and  thus if you empower them to build  their own apps with a no-code  platform they will produce better and more  relevant apps to help get  work done than an it department employee who  doesn’t even do the job  that the app is being built for. also, he  believes this will reduce  strain on it departments and allow them to  focus on more complex and  mission critical projects.here   is a quote from the director of sales (hina patel) at a smartsheet   customer, cisco (nasdaq: csco): “i have been waiting for a solution like   workapps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we  need,  when and where we need it,” said hina patel, director of sales   operations at cisco. “the ability to take our smartsheet assets, along   with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive   app will make it even easier to drive active participation from  everyone  involved in the process, no matter their role.” as you can  see, the  value proposition of workapps and the smartsheet platform  appears to be  high.lastly,  smartsheet also  generates revenue from professional services which is  essentially  providing training and customized consulting to smartsheet  customers  that want to get more out of the smartsheet platform. in the  most recent  quarter, q3 fy21, professional services accounted for 8.2%  of revenue.  here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:subscription revenue = $90,890m for 91.8% of total revenueprofessional services revenue = $8,043m for 8.2% of total revenuethis   is the end of my first

growth (roughly 35%), and the fact that it’s a subscription business model (saas). once i became aware of these facts, it cued me to take a deeper dive. the more i learned about smartsheet, the more i liked. management talks a lot about empowering people and that really struck a chord with me. in different roles i’ve had as a teacher, tutor, and supervisor, i’ve always found empowering people to be one of the most important keys to success. i will touch on this more later in the write up.another positive signal i got about smartsheet came unexpectedly one evening. i was sitting in the kitchen and my girlfriend was cooking dinner. i was watching an interview on my phone with mark mader, the ceo of smartsheet. my girlfriend overheard the word “smartsheet” mentioned in the video and said “are they talking about the smartsheet with the blue check mark?”. i had to google their logo but yes, it turns out we were thinking about the same smartsheet. i asked her how she knew about it. she said “my company just transitioned all of our work onto smartsheet. i really love it. our marketing department is really excited about it because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” hearing this just motivated me to learn more about smartsheet.**the thesis statement**for every stock pick i make, i want to provide a quick thesis statement that can serve as a reminder for why i’m buying and holding that stock for the long term. i’ll always aim to make it just a few sentences long so it can easily be remembered and internalized. this helps during times when the price may sporadically drop and you need to remember why you’re holding this position.the thesis statement i have come up with for smartsheet is as follows:*“smartsheet: a leader in collaborative work management (cwm) software. as the global workforce becomes more decentralized through remote work, managers and executives now more than ever need a tool to digitally consolidate their teams, projects and deadlines. smartsheet is that tool and is innovating to offer businesses even more ways to get the most out of their teams.”*i think this thesis statement really captures the essence of what smartsheet does. if you go to smartsheet’s website and look at the “about” page, you will find their “about” statement which says “smartsheet is the enterprise platform for dynamic work that aligns people and technology so your entire business can move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.” notice how their statement emphasizes helping businesses move faster, drive innovation, and achieve more.in my thesis statement, i mention that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm software space. but how do i know this? well, a highly reputable independent research firm named forrester conducted a study on the cwm space based off different criteria including collaboration, enterprise capabilities, ui/user experience, planned enhancements and number of customers just to name a few of the factors considered. i put the companies that were identified from the study in the order of their ranking below. as you can see, smartsheet is firmly planted as a leader in the space at 2nd place. let’s use our common sense for a second. at the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, do we want to invest in an up and coming saas company that focuses on providing firms with resources to digitally manage their teams, digitally manage work/projects, and digitally collaborate to get work done? i think the answer should be a resounding yes. but what about these other companies on the list. let’s break them down 1 by 1:* workfront was recently bought by adobe. if you want to invest in workfront, you’d have to invest in the much larger company of adobe. it wouldn’t be a pure play investment into the cwm space.* smartsheet is 2nd and of course, they are public :)* wrike is private* servicenow – cwm is just one small piece of their total      offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.  also, the company is already quite large ($106b market cap)* asana is public but just ipo’d on 9/30/20 about 3 months ago. we don’t have much data to track their performance as a      publicly traded company. furthermore, although they actually would be a pure play investment into the cwm space, they’re not a leader and rank behind smartsheet in several of forrester’s categories. why invest in the 2nd best when you can invest in the best?* monday.com is private* microsoft – cwm is just one small piece of their total offerings. investing here would not be a pure play into the cwm space.* atlassian – this company does primarily focus on cwm but i have a couple problems with them as an investment. 1) they’re ranked way beneath smartsheet. 2) they’re already too big for me to confidently say they can 10x (market cap already $58b).now that we’ve established that smartsheet is a leader in the cwm space and that they’re arguably the best publicly available pure-play investment in this space let’s understand why this is important. other than the obvious reason that we’re in the beginning stages of a remote work revolution, why is this important?well, let’s take a look at this quote from mark mader, smartsheet ceo, during the last earnings call (q3 fy21) that occurred on december 7th, 2020:“leaders are recognizing they need to shift more workloads to asynchronous work, work that is documented, automated, tracked with dashboards, and where priorities are clearly defined. they understand that by empowering their teams with no-code solutions that facilitate asynchronous work, cycle times will be improved, a deeper sense of ownership will be created, and prioritization and accountability will be insured. smartsheet is ideally suited to help enterprises work more asynchronously to derive the benefits from doing so.”key word here: asynchronous. asynchronous communication is different from synchronous communication. here is the difference:asynchronous: email, message boards, dashboards, etc. synchronous: video conferencing, chat, audio calls, etc. any communication that doesn’t require a real-time response can be considered asynchronous, like the examples in the picture above. synchronous communication is any communication that happens in real time, thereby allowing for immediate responses, see examples above. as part of my research on smartsheet, i read an e-book that was written by the original co-founders of smartsheet, mark mader the current ceo and brent frei who is no longer with the company. they wrote the e-book in 2007 just a couple of years after the 2005 founding. the e-book is called “the power of done”. the moral of the book is that mark and brent noticed through their own experience, and through different research studies on work place productivity, that the rise in technology in the early 21st century was actually making employees less productive. this is a quote from their e-book:“according to basex, a research firm focusing on the knowledge economy, interruptions from email, cell phones, instant messaging, text messaging and blogs eat up nearly 30 percent of each day; on an annualized basis, this represents a loss of 28 billion hours for the entire u.s. workforce, or a $588 billion cost to the american economy.”they mention in their book that although there has been a lot of advances in work technology such as email, word processing, and spreadsheets, there hadn’t at that time been any great applications created for teamwork collaboration or task management. the fact that technology advances helped the world create tools to enhance productivity but also deterred productivity at the same time is what mark and brent referred to as the productivity paradox. they wanted to do something about it and thus they founded smartsheet.**how smartsheet makes money**at the very least, before you invest in a company, you better understand how they make money. in chris mayers’ excellent book, 100 baggers, that i mentioned above, he continually references top line revenue growth as one of the main common indicators of a possible 100 bagger. this isn’t to tell you that any stock i pick will be a 100 bagger just because it has great top line revenue growth, but if i am looking at a growth stock to hold for the long term, revenue growth is one of the first things i look at.before i talk about the revenue streams of smartsheet, i want to share a little bit about the actual product that they sell to earn this revenue. co-founder/ceo mark mader realized that a lot of work in the corporate world was being done on spreadsheets such as microsoft excel. however, he realized that these spreadsheets were largely static and not necessarily used to their full potential. he wanted to help people get more out of their use of spreadsheets. as a result, we now have smartsheets which is a cloud based platform that can be accessed by all employees of the company no matter where they are with live information about project statuses, meeting times and work that is assigned to each employee just to name a few uses. users can choose their way of viewing this information with different views such as calendar view, grid view, card view, and gantt view. the idea is that by enhancing the availability and quality of asynchronous information available to all members of a team about the status of a project, the tasks assigned, and the timelines, the less synchronous communication will be needed which allows employees to spend more time doing what they’re hired to do – get work done. think about how wasteful it is to hire a highly talented engineer but then make him spend half his day preparing for and doing status update meetings and hunting people down to see where they’re at with their assignments. what if all this information was available for him, his managers, and his staff to see within smartsheet without having to bother each other and waste precious work hours that could be used for coding, designing, and producing? that’s what smartsheet looks to achieve.for smartsheet, their means of making money is quite simple. as i mentioned earlier, they are a software as a service (saas) company. whenever you see saas, that means subscription revenue and in my opinion that’s a very good thing. with a subscription business model, the revenue is going to be recurring every year and that type of reliability (combined with growth of course) is something you want as an investor.smartsheet’s primary source of revenue is the sale of subscriptions to their cloud-based collaborative work management (cwm) platform. customers and potential customers begin their engagement with the smartsheet platform by either signing up for a free trial, purchasing a subscription on the smartsheet website, going through a sales rep, or they are exposed to smartsheet by collaborating with a company/individual that uses smartsheet.  for subscriptions, customers select the plan that meets their needs and can begin using smartsheet within minutes.smartsheet offers four subscription levels: individual, business, enterprise, and premier, the pricing for which varies by the capabilities provided. customers can also purchase connectors, which provide data integration and automation to third-party applications.the connectors part of the business is something i find really interesting. basically, smartsheet has made deals with most of the top work productivity and communication software companies in the world to allow their customers to use those applications within their smartsheet user interface. this helps position smartsheet as the true “command center” platform while the products of the other companies become ancillary pieces. you’ll see this on the link above but some products that smartsheet sells connectors for include adobe creative cloud, microsoft dynamics 365, salesforce, jira software, slack, and skype just to name a few.i think that being able to sell these connectors as ancillary pieces to the smartsheet user experience is so beneficial to smartsheet because a lot of these companies that people may perceive as “smartsheet competitors” actually become a piece of the smartsheet platform and can be sold by smartsheet as a supplemental revenue stream. this neutral angle that smartsheet is able to come from by selling connectors to their perceived “competitors” reminds me a little bit of how roku (roku) is able to earn revenue off of selling a netflix subscription on their platform. i think just the fact that all these big companies like adobe, jira, salesforce, etc. allow their products to be integrated into smartsheet shows that there is a high value proposition in the smartsheet platform and that they would risk alienating their customers if they didn’t allow for their products to be integrated with smartsheet.on top of the connectors to third party vendors that smartsheet is able to sell, smartsheet is also able to sell upgrades to their own internal plug-ins. smartsheet has some impressive proprietary plug-ins they can sell to their customers. for example, in may 2019, smartsheet acquired 10,000ft which augmented their product portfolio by providing resource allocation and planning. the name “10,000ft” is meant to be analogous to having a high level view of your company and all resources available within your company and how to deploy them. also, in september 2020, smartsheet acquired brandfolder, inc. which provides a centralized platform to organize, discover, control, distribute, and measure all forms of digital content. combining brandfolder capabilities with smartsheet allows them to create dynamic solutions that manage workflows around content and collaboration. this goes back to what i said earlier in the article about how my girlfriend had mentioned that her company’s marketing team was “really excited about smartsheet because it makes their job way easier and more enjoyable.” she told me that before smartsheet, her company’s marketing team had to constantly hunt down members of the creative team (photographers, graphic designers) to receive the latest photos, videos, and digital designs they were working on. she said it was a big pain for them trying to share this content over email and sharepoint. now, all of the content is inside of smartsheet and the marketing team can access it at any time. they can leave comments on the content, route to appropriate individuals for approvals, and have better insight into the status of all digital content that is being worked on. the acquisition of brandfolder is really what allows smartsheet to stand out in this department. nobody really talks about it, but digital content is so important these days for companies in terms of controlling their brand image, putting out quality advertisements, and presenting their product in as positive of a light as possible. the fact that smartsheet has a strong proprietary plug-in for this with brandfolder is very promising. during smartsheet’s fy21 engage customer conference, anna griffin, smartsheet chief marketing officer said that the global annual marketing spend is $500b for companies around the world. she said the role of the marketing department is changing from sole content creator to editor in chief. all kinds of teams within companies these days are putting out content that effects the company’s brand. sales is running social media campaigns, product marketing is putting out blog posts and podcasts, and r&amp;d is teasing new product experiences in app. it can get really difficult for the company’s marketing/branding team to stay on top of all this without a centralized digital content collaboration platform like brandfolder in smartsheet. this is just one reason why i think smartsheet has a lot of growth opportunities in the future.as you can see, smartsheet has a lot to offer to companies with their core cwm platform, the connectors they can sell, and the internal upgrades available such as 10,000ft and brandfolder. on top of that, smartsheet also provides workapps, a proprietary no-code platform that empowers users to build intuitive web and mobile applications that streamline business and simplify collaboration. there are so many instances within companies where an app needs to be built to streamline a workflow. traditionally, companies need to engage their it departments and the coders that sit within these departments to build these apps. this places a lot of strain on it departments and takes away time they can be spending on more complex/mission critical projects. mark mader is aware of this and thus is heavily pushing no-code as a solution for companies now and in the future. he believes that everyday non-coder employees know their jobs/workflows best and thus if you empower them to build their own apps with a no-code platform they will produce better and more relevant apps to help get work done than an it department employee who doesn’t even do the job that the app is being built for. also, he believes this will reduce strain on it departments and allow them to focus on more complex and mission critical projects.here is a quote from the director of sales (hina patel) at a smartsheet customer, cisco (nasdaq: csco): “i have been waiting for a solution like workapps that can give us quick and easy access to the content we need, when and where we need it,” said hina patel, director of sales operations at cisco. “the ability to take our smartsheet assets, along with other tools we use, and package an entire solution in an intuitive app will make it even easier to drive active participation from everyone involved in the process, no matter their role.” as you can see, the value proposition of workapps and the smartsheet platform appears to be high.lastly, smartsheet also generates revenue from professional services which is essentially providing training and customized consulting to smartsheet customers that want to get more out of the smartsheet platform. in the most recent quarter, q3 fy21, professional services accounted for 8.2% of revenue. here is the breakout from the most recent quarter:subscription revenue = $90,890m for 91.8% of total revenueprofessional services revenue = $8,043m for 8.2% of total revenuethis is the end of

6806,"i wanted to put my thoughts out here on some of the psychological factors spurring what we are seeing with tesla and crypto. some of these are relatively simple, others are much ""deeper"".feel free to disagree or add some of your thoughts.1: get rich quick attitude: social media has shortened peoples attention spans, especially the younger generations. when they think of investing/trading, they are almost certainly going to make their first attempt a ""get rich quick scheme"". after all, they have heard about other people striking it rich on tesla and bitcoin in prior years. (this is not the first hype cycle for either one). markets are being more driven by social media trends rather than fundamental values - at least in the short term. we used to be able to write this off because prices come back to fundamentals in the mid to long term, but the short term price impact of favorable social media trends has become larger and is now impossible to ignore.2: lockdowns/stimulus: there have been an enormous number of new and younger people beginning to invest/trade this year as they had more time from the lockdowns to learn about how markets work. a large percentage of them are in the ""get rich quick category"". pair that with unemployment and stimulus checks, and we get large inflows of money. tediously watching markets may be a way for some to cope with boredom during lockdowns.3: heightened global uncertainty: recent events of 2020 make the world seem like a much riskier place and the future muss less certain. why invest in ""safe"" stuff and eek out 3-5% returns, when nothing seems safe? everything seems risky, to a certain extent, as so much has changed in the last year. if everything seems risky, why not go for the riskiest stuff that is already going up and that you have heard others make money on? it is hardly the time for making trades that will take 2-3 years to work out. they want immediate results, and assets already rising quickly are the best candidate.4: fomo/not being left behind: under normal circumstances, maybe you can handle other people making a lot of $ from a random stock, but that assumes you are in a good position yourself and are occupied on a lot of other activities to distract you. we are now in a position where almost nobody feels ""safe"". they want to do whatever they can to feel safe, and if the best option seems to be attempting to strike it rich in the markets, why not? what can they lose if they are already in the mindset that everything is lost? in addition, a lot of people have more free time to mull around stocks when they can't go out to social events every evening. trading/investing, then, can fill this ""excitement void"". and what more exciting than the volatile high flyers?5: perceived/actual inequality: it is not enough to make enough $ to go on a nice vacation or buy a nice car. not when everyone is constantly bombarded with extremely rich and successful people on social media. jealousy/envy are making people jump into these ""moonshots"" as last ditch efforts to catch up to some impossible ""success ideal"". as a result, they put more $ in and hold stuff longer.",10,1,TSLA and Crypto Bubbles - 2020 Psychological Factors,Finance

7203,"hi all,i just wanted to bring to everyone's attention of a possible fraudulent finance youtuber. just in case you are getting stock picks from him, do not trust his videos blindly. his claim is that he was a senior financial analyst in new york, working for one of the biggest asset managers. he supposedly worked in the financial industry for close to a decade. after which, he changed jobs to work as a professional consultant with one of the big 4s. so far, i don't have any issues with his career path. this is all well and good, however, i started to research more on his background/credentials over various social media platforms, after i watched one of his ""stock advice"" videos which did not make much sense. suspicion 1:1. i went to look up all his social media platforms. initially, i wanted to see if he had a linkedin profile, so i could see where he worked at previously. however there was nothing much about his former jobs, but many certificates relating to youtube skills.2. i chanced across his reddit and found that he has been trying his hand at becoming a youtube content creator as far as 2 years back. he started as a *youtube content creator guru*, where he posted many videos like ""how to improve your sound and voice quality"" or ""how to make money from a small youtube channel without ads"". the videos are all deleted from youtube, but you can still see the posts that he made on reddit if you scroll down. (refer to u/tomnash_youtube)3. i'm guessing that did not work out so well, so he created a second and third youtube account called gearlyreviews where he reviews electronics (he is still relatively active, last post was 2 months ago) and euroball where he only posted 2 videos (i assumed he gave up on this account after it did not gather much views).4. i'm guessing those scenes did not gather much traction, so he moved on to doing videos on exposing fake gurus. that gave him a degree of success, and from there, i guess he started to creep his way into the youtube finance world, and taking on a new persona as a former financial analyst.conclusion: from his history of reddit posts, he seemed to be an average guy trying to break into the youtube scene. it's hard to explain what i mean, so i think it's best to read his reddit account and his historic posts. some examples are posts like ""what's a good click through rate"" or ""do you use your face in your thumbnails"" etc. the fact that over two years, he went through so much effort to become a youtuber and even tested and jumped across various youtube scenes, suggests that he was trying to become a professional content creator and earn money through youtube. suspicion 2:1. his stock picks are basically videos on stocks that were already hyped up. in his videos, his projections on the industry are often very superficial or are just completely garbage. basically, some of the stuff he mentions are definitely not what a former financial analyst would say. for example, his video on $chek, he mentioned of proprietary technology that would push the stock price up if it was approved and goes through mass adoption. but the problem is, this technology already exists and while i could go into greater details, the point is, he seems to be making very lazy research and uninformed projections. to the new guys on youtube, they wouldn't know better and would blindly follow his advice.overall conclusion: i think there are many things that are fishy about him. i don't believe he was ever a professional financial analyst because he definitely does not have the knowledge i would expect of one. apart from that, his life seems to revolve around youtube only. if he was a retired analyst, i would expect that there would still be some trace of that in his social media, whether it is a casual mention in his videos like ""back in the firms, we used to do this"" or some posts on finance subreddits/twitter/facebook or some photos of him in his firms etc. another big red flag is that he used to sell courses on his facebook even though he claims to never have done so. if you guys want to verify what i'm talking about, just have a search on google and find his reddit/facebook etc. why am i spending so much effort doing this? i don't like frauds and i believe they should be exposed. they are making money off people who don't know better and they should not be enjoying the success that they have by being dishonest. for those who follow tom nash, i recommend for all to take his advice with a grain of salt. **remember, in a bull market, everyone is a genius.** you will not realize his advice is garbage until it's too late. thanks all. invest safely.",66,1,Suspected Fraud: Tom Nash (Finance youtuber),Finance

(otc:otcpk:diibf) is a relatively unknown canadian company that produces an interesting mix of products including home furniture, bicycles, and baby products such as strollers, car seats, and swings. the company is well-diversified as each category of products is separated into many different brands. for example, dorel's sports division owns brands such as cannondale and gt. the company sells its products to basically every region in the world, including latin america and asia.the company's stock has increased 1000% since the march crash despite not having paid a dividend since late 2019, and this uptick was mainly fueled by the company's success in the sports category. we hold a bullish view of the company; we believe that dorel's position in the bicycle market will continue to grow due to changes in consumer trends as a result of covid-19. the company also has a strong enough balance sheet position to outpace competitors in terms of production and innovation, and its other revenue segments operate in markets where demand will continue to stay steady.￼(dorel industries - google market chart, 2020)biking grew increasingly popular during covid-19, and this trend is here to stayin ""dorel sports, demand for bikes continued to spike, as families were looking for outdoor activities that are safe (dorel quarterly report, 2020). although the company credits short-term reasonings for the continued success of its bikes, we believe that this trend is here to stay for the long-term.￼(statista, 2020)firstly, the overall demand for all kinds of biking has gone up, whether it be mountain biking, off-trail cycling, or road biking. consumers will have different preferences based on the availability of certain terrains within their neighborhood. dorel industries is extremely well-positioned to capture consumers in all areas because it has 9 different bicycle brands that each cater to a unique customer segment.we believe that cannondale, which is a higher-end road cycling brand, will see an uptick in sales especially during early spring of next year, as new consumers who picked up biking in urban environments during covid-19 were deciding whether or not to lock in their long-term interest in cycling before buying a bike at a higher price point. moreover, these consumers may have been using lower-end bikes during the summer of 2020 because higher-end bicycles were basically sold out everywhere during the pandemic.all the other brands that dorel owns should see growth as well, as consumers look to capitalize on a full summer of outdoor activities. other brands include schwinn, which produces electric bikes, and gt, which focuses on mountain and off-road biking.we believe that biking, in general, will see an increase in the long-term because of the social aspect that has been introduced to the sport. strava, which is a social media app that allows users to show off their exercising events, saw a ""33% increase in uploaded activities over the last 12 months."" we believe that the euphoria that consumers get from strava interactions such as sharing, liking, and commenting on posts, matches the feelings consumers get from traditional social media outlets such as facebook and instagram. therefore, biking enthusiasts, whether old or new, have an extra incentive to participate in the sport.only 34.5% of the company's sales came from the sports division, which suggests that the company has lots of room to grow.",3,1,Dorel industries!

8293,"as a relative newcomer to (active) investment, i’m interested in people’s investment strategies regarding the faang, and rationale for trying to pick the next potential members.in terms of how i rate the faang (and microsoft) currently -i’m bullish on amazon, apple and microsoft. amazon in particular seems set for further massive growth with aws and delivery innovations. apple continues to successfully move into new product lines, whilst dominating the top end consumer devices market, and continuing to offer at least some competition to microsoft in the business space. microsoft continues to monopolise the business space, and grow azure. i have confidence all will continue to successfully innovate into new market segments. for example, i think apple tv will get stronger, and apple music will begin taking a bigger bite out of spotify’s market share.whilst it remains mired in controversy, and biden appears keen to try and reign in their data privacy and targeted advertising, i’m confident on facebook. i continue to view negative press as a good opportunity to buy the dip. while they could be massively constrained, and customers *could* just move onto other platforms (as i’ve often heard touted), they continue to have a large moat around social media. noones managed to knock them off yet. whatsapp remains very popular (particularly here in western europe), and i think there would need to be a new player with a better overall user experience in either category to actually affect facebook’s moat. people may move to apps like signal and telegram in greater numbers. facebook continues to compete and arguably has pulled ahead of google in the advertising space. it’s also pivoted well into gaming (with oculus), and the online marketplace (albeit competing more with ebay and craigslist, rather than amazon or baba). i can see it faring equally well on payments.google continues to hold market dominance of the search and mapping space. i can’t see it losing this. it’ll also continue to remain competitive in advertising and operating systems, particularly for advertising revenue when society returns to the “before times” and more people are using it for everyday life. that said, google has often tried and failed to innovate (see: “killedbygoogle”). it seems to have stagnated, in the company’s inability to capitalise on some of their innovations. while it still retains some competition in areas like consumer electronics (chromebools), the cloud and smart tech; it isn’t close to dominating those markets. i think google will remain a very strong company for some time, and i’d pile in if it looked like a successful project was on the horizon - as we may yet see from self-driving cars and ai. netflix will also likely retain its moat for some time to come, given the quality of the product and its user interface. competition exists, but it’s a long way from seriously eating into their market share. they have had some (expensive) flops, but they continue to generate good content - particularly in documentary making. that said, for me to invest i’d want to see evidence of a pivot into trying to dominate another market segment. while google has probably tried to compete in too many different areas of the market, netflix hasn’t at all. will it eventually look to monetise the targeted data it has collected on its customers?outside of the faang, tesla has been a meme stock for its meteoric rise and potential to monopolise the ev space - though it remains to be seen whether it will continue to innovate, and hold this monopoly. if it can, it could well achieve faang-level market dominance.what do people think are realistically the (large, medium or small cap) companies that have the potential to enter this level of market dominance? i’ve seen good cases made for nvidia, square and roku dominating their markets. do you think this will be faang level, with the same ability to innovate?there are clear trends that are likely to shape the future - ev and the wider renewable energy market, further environmentally-focused markets like meat alternatives, genomics, medical cannabis, payments and ai. how do people pick companies that are likely to dominate in these areas at this point, when there are so many players in the various areas? do you also look at growth stocks in these areas, or areas like sports betting that are likely to take off in the us market, as solid investments (with the obvious risks) - given the potential to become large cap companies and dominate their sectors? i’ve seen the bull case for draftkings, but much like areas such as genomics and medical cannabis, there are legislative hurdles to overcome, and other companies could rise to fill that space. while draftkings is leading a lot of the sports betting push, it doesn’t have the largest market share, and when you look at western europe, you see how much competition there is; with no clear sector dominance. are you looking to invest in a company that, by the potential to grow into a big player, could still see a huge return on investment, or are you trying to calculate and determine which companies could completely dominate their markets?",28,1,"Investing in the FAANG, and finding the next potential member",Finance
8541,"  long post here:i need some advice about what i think is a pretty complicated situation.my father passed away unexpectedly just over a week ago. my sister and i had planned to do a will for both him and my mom this year, but it didn’t happen. his assets are 2.85 acres of land on which sits a very dilapidated, shack of a home built in the late 1940s. this house has not been cleaned in over a decade and has a significant issue with mold, rodent infestation, and dog use and abuse. at least one of the windows is broken, the front porch bending and unstable, the kitchen water drains into the backyard, the well that provides water to house constantly is having issues with rain water intrusion and making their water turn brown and unpotable. my parents were hoarders and didn’t have room in the 560 sq. foot house for all their tools, and small gadgets and dirty clothes. we just found out the washing machine had been broken for well over a year so my mom was trying to wash her clothes in the shower tub with very little success. my mother is very obese, in her mid-50s and has receiving disability benefits for 30+ years due to a host of physical ailments and conditions that would almost assuredly prevent her from earning money from working.my dad took out a loan on the land (\~$10k) a few years ago and they are current on the payments ($410/month with over a 20% interest rate due to their very low credit). the property is deeded to my father only and the loan was in his name only as well. in my state, intestate law states that the land will go to the surviving spouse and equal shares of the descendants (1/3 my mom, 1/3 me, and 1/3 my sister).we think we may have found a place for my mother to live that she can afford with her monthly social security benefit payment close to us where we can help her get to her doctor appointments and help her mentally/physically with visiting her often. when my father was alive, they were both enablers and became very isolated, further exacerbating their physical issues, and their crippling depression.my sister and i are planning to contribute financially to my mother and her new living arrangements around ($300/month), but we are looking for my mother to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible.the current property is \~3 miles from a very popular lake used for recreation. the land is zoned agricultural residential 3 (ar3) and is surrounded by new development but it is still in a very rural area. the property appraised by the tax assessor’s office in 2020 was $32,650. i haven’t hired an agent yet but i do believe that is a bit lower than what the market could fetch.my brother-in-law, a builder and an avid fisherman, believes that the acreage and proximity to the lake would bode well for rehabbing the home and operating as a rental property and source of income for both my mother and our family.this is a delicate situation because of the emotional aspects involved but we want to make the best decision for the future of my mother and this land has been in my family for at least 4 generations, so i don’t want to sell the land to just satisfy the loan if the value will continue to go up (as we expect).should we pay off the balance of the loan with agreement that we would continue to buy my mother’s and sister’s share of the land? we can’t buy both of their shares of the land right now but we can make payments every month.should we just continue to make the $410/month payment with the understanding that we (my wife and i) will control more equity in the land?should we sell it all and put the profit in a fund for my mom’s living expenses for the next few years?should we rehab the home and look to subdivide the land?should we rehab the home to rent it out and try to put a few more smaller homes there and rent those out as well to generate income for my mother to live on and improve her living arrangements with more care?is there any solution to this quagmire that i’m not already thinking about?tl;dr my father died without a will and he had some land and a house that should be condemned and my family is trying to figure out what to do with it to benefit everyone.",21,1,Dad passed away-no will-left us some land with a loan,Finance

9038,"**business overview**fiverr is an online marketplace that connects freelancers and buyers (businesses, entrepreneurs, and others). buyers on fiverr’s platform can buy services across a variety of services ranging from one of eight verticals:1. graphics &amp; design2. digital marketing3. writing &amp; translation4. video &amp; animation5. music &amp; audio6. programming &amp; tech7. business8. lifestylethese verticals cover more than 300 different gigs. the number of gigs offered is only expanding each year. some examples of “gigs” (what fiverr refers to as a job/service) are logo design, website development, and blog writing. these “gigs” are standardized through a defined cost, scope of work, and delivery date. different sellers will have different prices for an identical service, but each seller will offer the same service to different buyers at the same terms. fiverr’s management team has done this on purpose in order to make it feel like a typical e-commerce transaction. although the name fiverr implies $5, projects can range from $5 to thousands of dollars.**why do sellers choose fiverr?*** fiverr aggregates demand for sellers, allowing freelancers to get jobs without having to proactively sell their services. fiverr helps freelancers with contract negotiations, payment collection, and other administrative tasks.**why do buyers choose fiverr?*** buyers want vetted talent. buyers can look through reviews of different sellers to find a talented freelancer. instead of having to go out and look for talent, fiverr aggregates the supply of talent on its platform. through an e-commerce like experience, buyers avoid the hassle of negotiating price, terms of the work, and the delivery date.**total addressable market**management expects the total market opportunity to be roughly $100bn, which seems fair. i think the best-case scenario is that this company could be a couple hundred billion dollars in market cap. if freelancing takes off as it has in the last decade and as more organizations both large and small look to utilize talent over a short period of time, more buyers will be spending money on fiverr. small companies do not have the luxury of hiring full-time employees but would be willing to pay for someone skilled enough to complete a project. there is another startup called [lemon.io](https://lemon.io/) that has remote developers on its platform to help non-technical entrepreneurs start and launch a business. i believe the market could be much larger than many people understand.fiverr can be the winning freelancing platform. fiverr benefits from network effects which could give fiverr a competitive edge over competitors. who knows what this space will look like, but i think more people will be self-employed/working for some side cash than the current amount today.fiverr’s spend per buyer has also increased each year. the normalcy of using a platform like fiverr will most likely grow in the future as more people and businesses try to outsource small and large tasks like logo design, voice-overs, social media, website building, and plenty of other tasks.**competitive advantages**1. **marketplace:** if fiverr becomes the largest freelancing marketplace in the world, this business could be huge. fiverr seems to be the winning marketplace but they have strong competition from [**upwork**](https://www.upwork.com/) and [**toptal**](https://www.toptal.com/). marketplaces benefit from network effects. as more buyers are on the platform, more sellers are attracted to using the platform, and vice versa. if fiverr captures the leading market share in this industry, smaller competitors will be unable to compete with them.2. **switching costs:** sellers are able to establish a “storefront” where they can showcase skills, establish a track record, and develop a professional reputation.if sellers wanted to switch platforms, they’d have to consider the costs of basically starting anew on another platform. some sellers may use multiple platforms but if fiverr is the most active platform for the majority of sellers, then why not focus the most time on fiverr.**tailwinds**1. **gig economy:** a 2016 mckinsey independent work study found that up to 162 million people across the us and europe were engaged in “independent work.” there weren’t other details in conjunction with this number, but more and more people will look to automate work through professionals with better skills than an amateur (like a professional graphic designer making a logo versus a sloppy logo done by an amateur). more and more people will turn into freelancers (even if it’s only part-time) in order to get some extra cash and work on some skills on the side.i think covid-19 has shown people that relying on a typical 9-5 job isn’t always a guarantee. people more than ever are looking to make some extra cash.2. **work from anywhere:** through platforms like fiverr, substack, and many others, people can work from wherever, when they want to work, and how they want to work for. this is a tailwind that covid-19 has accelerated and i believe it is here to stay. fiverr allows buyers and sellers to connect without ever having to meet in person and much of the communication can be done through messages or the occasional zoom call.**financials**there are a handful of financial numbers and categories that i believe matter most for fiverr. as a preface, like the early innings of many marketplaces, fiverr has not been profitable in the last three annual years. this is just a snapshot of the income statement, and a full investment memo would cover more of this picture.**2019*** gmv: $401 million* revenue: $107 million* operating income: -$35 million* active buyers: 2.4 million* spend per buyer: $170* take rate: 26.7%* repeat buyers: 58% of revenue* buyers who spent over $500: 54% of revenue* service fees: 27% of revenue* transaction fees: 73% of revenue**2018*** gmv: $294* revenue: $76 million* operating income: -$36 million* active buyers: 2.1 million* spend per buyer: $145* take rate: 25.7%* repeat buyers: 57% of revenue* buyers who spent over $500: 50% of revenue* service fees: 27% of revenue* transaction fees: 73% of revenue**2017*** gmv: $213 million* revenue: $52 million* operating income: -$20 million* active buyers: 1.8 million* spend per buyer: $119* take rate: 24.5%* repeat buyers: 55% of revenue* service fees: 25% of revenue* transaction fees: 75% of revenuefiverr has some really great growth and i believe covid-19 has accelerated the revenue and gmv. the increasing take rate is also a pretty picture. gmv is growing nicely and i believe there is an incredible runway for this business. there will always be work needed to be done and people willing to pay for it.fiverr charges buyers 5% and sellers 20%. for a $100 gig, buyers pay $105 and sellers receive $80. fiverr pockets the difference. this is a combined take rate of 25%. the additional percentage points are from additional revenue streams like advertising and services offered to both businesses and freelancers.**future questions**1. **competitors:** i know fiverr has competitors like upwork, toptal, and more traditional staffing companies. i’d research these other companies and mostly upwork because fiverr and upwork seem to be the two largest freelancer marketplaces. fiverr and the rest of the online freelancing market is in the early innings of its future potential.2. **tam:** although management cites the total addressable market around $100bn, the whole work industry is in the trillions of dollars. if fiverr were to continuously capture a small portion of this market for years and years to come, i think this industry could have a long runway of growth for fiverr and for others competing in this industry.**conclusion**fiverr is an extremely attractive company for me personally. i’d be interested in covering fiverr in a more in-depth research report in the future. fiverr has a \~$7.2bn market cap at the time of this email (december 7th, 2020). i think fiverr can easily increase its market cap by more than 10x in the future. the mega bull thesis is that the majority of online services are performed on fiverr’s platform. if amazon sells the majority of physical goods then fiverr sells the majority of online services. that’s a strong statement to make, but i believe it’s not impossible.if you want more updates visit [weekly10k.substack.com](https://weekly10k.substack.com/). if you made it this far, i

9228,"there is an etf that makes trades based on artificial intelligence (ticker: aieq). the ai combs through mountains of data (expressly including social media and regular news reporting). when i heard about it, i was originally dubious about its ability to beat a relatively efficient market based on searching through this dataset, but i was curious. so i bought a little bit when it debuted, and it didn't do much of anything, and indeed kinda underperformed so i lost patience and sold it. but i remember an ai podcast i heard that talked about machine learning and how early on (with chess, or go, or other tests), humans would beat the ai easily. but then over time, ai progressively learned and then became unbeatable. so i took a flyer and bought back into aieq in early november and continued to leg into the position, and it continues to do well. i ran a three month chart vs. spy and vanguard's total stock index. it is beating both handily. (this is true on longer time periods also, but i didn't own it before november). moreover, the outperformance seems to be accelerating, which could mean the ai is learning and improving as it goes.that outperformance raised my eyebrows, and i was surprised that this dataset had in fact yielded actionable alpha. then i heard about wallstreetbets. and then i made the connection - aieq may be outperforming because it is reading all the reddit trade discussion, and is following or perhaps even front-running those trades. if you look at aieq's top portfolio positions, they are full of reddit faves like tsla, enph, spwr, amd, roku, etsy, sq, mrna, zs, crwd, plug, etc. i don't know if my theory is correct (the ai trading methodology is a black box), but it's certainly food for thought.note: i originally posted this in wallstreetbets but the moderator removed it for unknown reasons.(i've reviewed all of their content guidelines and am unable to find any that i violated, unless they just don't want people to know my theory). that said, it's applicable here too. in fact, maybe more so because this subreddit is more sober and analytical about topics.",3,1,AI could be front-running WallStreetBets,Finance

future of corporate stewardship – and therefore corporate governance – rests in the hands of a few large institutional investors.[1] questions of whether these funds have the necessary incentives to pursue stewardship have set off an explosion of research by both legal scholars and economists alike. some say that funds lack even the basic incentives to vote on value-enhancing corporate governance matters because, while even large benefits diffuse among investors, funds bear the totality of the upfront costs.[2] others argue that funds – through their common ownership of nearly all public companies – have perverse incentives to encourage anti-competitive behavior.[3]&gt;these questions are hard to answer empirically because fund incentives are not directly observable. but regulatory changes can provide an opportunity to observe how funds adjust their behavior in response, revealing a window into their incentives.&gt;in a new paper, we look at exactly this: we examine funds’ incentives through an empirical study of the lending-voting tradeoff after the securities and exchange commission’s 2019 guidance on funds’ fiduciary duties. the guidance departed from prior practice by encouraging funds to take into account “opportunity costs” of share lending when making their voting decisions. in the past, sec staff guidance required that funds recall shares they loaned when material items were on the ballot to ensure that voting would occur.&gt;we show that after the new guidance, funds dramatically increased share lending. specifically, we show that for stocks with high index fund ownership – those having the strongest economic incentive to try to earn additional lending fees – the supply of shares on loan increases from 15.6 percent to 22.3 percent. share supply increases by 3.8 percent, even for proxy fights.&gt;more share lending means less voting – regardless of whether the shares are borrowed in the end. because shares can be borrowed at-will from the lending agent or broker, and then voted by the ultimate holder as of the record date, shares put on loan do not carry voting instructions. hence, shares made available for loan but not borrowed are not voted – making share lending a significant contributor to non-voting. by one estimate, in 2010 alone, 60 billion shares went unvoted, with 15 billion shares on loan.&gt;with no fiduciary constraint on share lending, corporate elections can have surprising results. most notably, in june of 2020, a proxy fight at gamestop surprised the investor and corporate community when activists with only 7.3 percent of shares won board seats despite opposition from large institutional investors that collectively owned around 40 percent of shares. this was possible because nearly 40 percent of gamestop shares (nearly all the shares held by institutions) were on loan, most of which were presumably borrowed by short sellers and other investors with goals contrary to the funds and similar long-term investors.&gt;our evidence supports the hypothesis that funds face a lending-voting dilemma, which speaks to their incentive problems.[4] while funds can in theory effectuate beneficial governance changes through cooperation and voting, each has strong private incentives to favor certain lending revenues over the uncertain and diffuse benefits of voting. hence, the free-rider problem – made worse by the guidance – can lead to under-voting from a social welfare perspective.[5]&gt;low turnout by funds can have broad implications beyond governance. today funds are beginning to lead the charge on environmental and social reforms. indeed, recent research shows that funds can play an important role in identifying value-enhancing socially responsible investing (sri) proposals and helping to increase overall shareholder welfare.[6] but public pronouncements will amount to nothing more than cheap talk if funds choose to lend rather than vote.&gt;for those interested in fund stewardship the story does not end here. the department of labor has finalized rulemaking that would require pension funds to focus only on risk-adjusted financial returns in their investment and stewardship decisions. while the goal may be to protect investors from expropriation, the result may be to discourage voting on even widely accepted governance proposals such as separating the ceo and board chair positions when the implications for an individual company’s stock returns may be hard to predict.&gt;as we have shown, funds already have strong incentives to favor lending over voting. tipping the scales even further against voting, as the sec and dol have done, will likely drive funds away from participating in corporate elections – shielding management from accountability at the expense of shareholder welfare.",8,1,The Index-Fund Dilemma: An Empirical Study of the Lending-Voting Tradeoff,Finance

11302,"a correction (\~-20%) can happen, but the bubble will not burst (where $tsla loses more than 50%-90% of its value). here's why:  so a lot of people often use the dotcom bubble as a parallel to speculate the pop of the tesla bubble. the most immediate comparisons come from names such as amazon, which lost nearly 90% of its value from the peak of the bubble but was eventually able to gain back most of its shares. other comparisons also include stocks such as yahoo, which was actually added to the s&amp;p 500 in 1999, right before the bubble burst, or even qualcomm/cisco. these speculations and comparisons are always interesting to think about. they come from deductions, aka where you extrapolate data points from the past in order to predict what is going to happen in the future. however, a deduction is often not the most useful mental model, especially when circumstances are different in the future. and this is one of those cases where the circumstances are actually very different. now the basic argument of ""tesla is not a car company"" is often overused. yes, tesla creates batteries, they are going into the autonomous market soon, their autopilot is one of the best ai that the world has today (stronger than nvidia's gpus), they are going to get into the insurance game, they are going to get into the financing industry, some people might even say they are going to collaborate with space x to create flying cars in 2050. that's all great. however, i'm actually going to argue that despite all of these things, tesla's current price is overvalued but yet, the stock will not burst. and this has in large part to do with how the markets and trader psychology works today, and how different it is from 1999/2000:as information and financial data has become more widely available through the internet, the markets have had a tendency to price things way ahead of it's time. for example, tesla believers (bloggers/youtubers/communities) can now share their bull case for tesla and what the company will do years and years down the line. while ceos and company personnel are not allowed to share such projections due to sec rules, there is nothing stopping these communities from doing so. the most prominent of this has perhaps been cathie wood's ark invest. she laid out the case for tesla way back in 2017, and as some of her projections (such as tesla's profitability) have proven to be correct, people have now become believers that her entire bull case (of tesla owning the entire autonomous space) will eventually be correct. in a way, the market has become this binary mechanism. fomo kicks in due to the widespread information that is available, and people pile in. now, most tesla bulls believe in the $7000 pt (pre-split) that cathie wood has put on this stock, and i doubt very many people are going to be willing to sell before that price. in 1999, if a hedge fund manager was very bullish on a stock, most other investors had no way of knowing. there has been trend towards open-sourcing investing ideas from many investors, and this is a massive deal with tesla. other examples of this include rob baron or chamath, who are also very famous investors and well-known tesla bulls. 20 years ago, investing ideas were supposed to be secretive, with retail investors very much out of the know and speculating on their own. this is no longer the case today. in a way, we now live in an investing world of stories, where the story of a stock matters more than the numbers, and these stories get reverberated through social media communities. what a company will do 20 years down the line is a story that is just now more widely available. so even if tesla stock drops by 10-15% tomorrow, i believe that there are enough believers in this story where they will just continue to buy up the stock from those prices. ""buy the dip"" has become this sort of motto in many of these investing communities, and this same theory is true for any of these companies that seem to be outlandishly valued as tesla. the bottom line is: as long as the story stays, the bubble of tesla will not pop. even if tesla has a bad quarter but their long term outlook stays the same, i very much think this will stand true. the only way this bubble pops is if the story changes somehow. that can either be from investors such as ark saying they no longer believe in the long term hypothesis or other events such as the death of elon musk. otherwise, tesla will very much continue to stand strong.",315,1,Why the $TSLA bubble will not burst?,Finance

(sources at the end below)*most lithium is commercially produced from either the extraction of lithium-containing salts from underground brine reservoirs or the mining of lithium-containing rock, such as spodumene.* *lithium production from clay sources* *is expected to become commercially viable, though perhaps not until 2022.**lithium is a metal commonly used in batteries like the rechargeable ones found in laptops, cellphones, and electric cars as well as in ceramics and glass. it is the lightest metal on earth and is soft enough to be cut with a knife when in its elemental form.**demand has soared in recent years as carmakers move toward electric vehicles, as* *many countries including the uk, sweden, the netherlands, france, norway and canada* *announce a phase-out of combustion-engine cars. in fact,* *five times more lithium than is mined currently is going to be necessary to meet global climate targets by 2050*\*, according to the world bank.\**but there’s one big problem. obtaining lithium by conventional means takes its own environmental toll, or rather three: carbon emissions, water and land.**lithium is currently sourced mainly from hard rock mines, such as those in australia, or underground brine reservoirs below the surface of dried lake beds, mostly in chile and argentina. hard rock mining – where the mineral is extracted from open pit mines and then roasted using fossil fuels – leaves scars in the landscape, requires a large amount of water and releases 15 tonnes of co2 for every tonne of lithium, according to an analysis by the raw materials experts minviro for the lithium and geothermal energy firm vulcan energy resources. the other conventional option, extracting lithium from underground reservoirs, relies on even more water to extract the lithium – and it takes place in typically very water-scarce parts of the world, leading to indigenous communities questioning their sustainability.**extracting lithium from geothermal waters – found not just in cornwall, but germany and the us as well – has a tiny environmental footprint in comparison, including very low carbon emissions.**geothermal brine is a hot, concentrated saline solution that has circulated through very hot rocks and become enriched with elements such as lithium, boron and potassium. in other words, the energy-intensive process of extracting lithium from solid rock is powered by naturally occurring geothermal energy. the brine in the cornish mines has concentrations of up to 260 milligrams per litre, flowing at a rate of between 40-60 litres (8.1 to 13.7 gallons) per second. that works out as about enough lithium for a typical smartphone battery (2-3g) passing through the production process every few seconds, according to cornish lithium’s estimates.**the demand for lithium with a lower environmental footprint appears to be gaining ground. there are signs car manufacturers including mercedes-benz and volkswagen are starting to think about the environmental and social impact of their electric vehicle supply chain, says alex keynes, clean vehicles manager at brussels-based campaign organisation transport and environment. using lithium that is already in circulation – from recycled batteries and electronics – is preferable to mining more, says keynes. “given the enormous demand we’re likely to see over the coming years, \[it\] is going to mean we need some extraction, and recovering lithium from geothermal brine looks very promising,” says keynes.**the speed of lithium extraction from brine deposits could be significantly increased using a technique recently developed by an international team of scientists.**the new filtration technique mimics the capabilities of living cells and has been tailored specifically to filter lithium ions in an “ultra-fast, one-directional and highly-selective manner”.**according to the researchers, the technology — which remains in an early stage — could one day reduce lithium-from-brine extraction times from several months to just a matter of hours*\*.\**they have said they are hopeful the technique will be able to provide “a clear roadmap for resource recovery”, as well as for other uses such as “low-energy water purification” — noting the particular* *benefit of greater lithium availability to “enabling electric vehicles and grid integration of renewable energy sources*\*”.\**it is the* *latest in a series of lithium extraction technology breakthroughs*\*, as researchers around the world seek ways to make access to this increasingly-important mineral easier and more cost-effective.\***the company**lake resources nl (asx:lke, otc: llkkf) is a clean lithium developer utilising direct extraction technology for

469,"as a long-time fire enthusiast living in shanghai i'm happy to report that i'm starting to see signs that the movement is catching on in china. this [recent article](http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1005905/for-young-chinese%2c-the-coolest-thing-to-do-in-2020-is-retire) by *sixth tone* summarises the situation on the ground quite nicely.it's still more of an isolated subculture than a movement here. very few young people will even have heard of fire in mainland china and the blocking of reddit by the government certainly doesn't help. nevertheless i think the ground is fertile for fire to spread (i apologise for the pun/mixed-metaphors) because (1) chinese people are among the most materalistic and consumeristic in the world, and (2) the local work environment can be particularly oppressive. as the *sixth tone* article points out:&gt; in some ways, fire appears a natural extension of a growing counterculture in china, where 80% of employees report feeling overworked, and young people are increasingly pushing back against unreasonable working hours.there are some important differences in the environment for fire compared to the developing world:* interest rates are still substantially higher than in the west. 5-year chinese government bond yields are at close to 2.7% compared with less than 0.3% for the equivalent us treasury. even after rates moved lower this year, i can still put my money in a 3-month money market fund and get a 4% return. of course you could argue that investors in the chinese market take on a different and greater set of risks. equities are a lot less reliable sources of return than in the us and most people put their money in property or bank-issued wealth management products.* because the cost of basic goods is generally low, a person can live on a pittance even in a major city as long as he/she doesn't splash out on fancy entertainment. in shanghai, cny30 (about usd4) in groceries could easily and sustainably feed a family of three, as long as they did all the cooking themselves. for some people the biggest costs are actually social obligations, such as giving money at weddings and at funerals, which is hard to escape. when my cousin got married a couple years back, for example, my parents and i gave him cny20,000 (about usd2,800) as a wedding gift. for average relatives and close friends, you'd have to fork out a few thousand yuan at least. you can sort of see how you might run into liquidity issues if you have several friends or relatives getting married in a single month.* property prices here are among the most expensive in the world, and especially relative to income. in shanghai, where i live, price/income is probably between 30-40x. this makes it hard for young people to achieve fi/re, especially new comers to first or second tier cities who don't stand to inherit or be gifted property from their parents.* the *hukou* system of household registration makes it hard for families to move around the country to take advantage of lower living costs. since social security benefits – the most important of which are education and healthcare – are tied to the city where you are registered, it's hard to move to another city unless you are wealthy enough to be able to afford private hospitals and private schools. this makes it easier for young people without children to embrace lean fire but much harder for a family with kids to do so.* the social safety net is a lot less reliable than in most developed economies, so a person would need to save a lot more money to achieve financial independence. again, quoting the *sixth tone* article: &gt; but china, with its basic social safety net, turbulent markets, and rapidly increasing cost of living, is also a risky place to play with fire. “a big illness could cut your savings in half,” says li, the financial blogger.",243,1,Catching FIRE in China,Finance

1108,"my 75 yr old mom needs help with her credit card debt.  her only income is her social security ($1300/mth) and up until now has been making large minimum payments on two credit cards she has debt on(10k, 11k). these are two cards that she says she no longer can maintain and needs to do something about it bc they are taking a huge chunk out of her monthly income, which is making it hard to get by.  she has one cc that she uses occasionally and pays off regularly.  the other two are accumulated debt over 15 yrs on everyday living expenses that she should have been more wise with. if she didn't have these 2 huge minimum payments to make, she would be financially stable with her one card. my first thought was to try and negotiate a settlement with the cards on our own. if she could get the debt to be half of that and pay it off by getting a personal loan from the bank w lower interest rate, that would be manageable for her. i realize this does impact her credit score and history.  but her other option, to just stop paying them, would do the same.  my question here is if she does stop paying them and she receives settlement offers from the credit card company or collection agency in 8 mths or however long it takes, will her credit be tanked by then for here not to be able to take out a personal loan from her bank to pay the settlement offers? having said all this, without my knowledge, she went and applied for a home equity loan (shouldnt she be able to get a personal loan not tied to the house?? ) and was approved but hasn't signed it yet due to a delay on banks part.  i told her to wait bc she doesn't want to be in debt to the bank vs unsecured credit cards (better).  so, i'm at a loss as to what the best route is to help her.   i'm anxious about negotiating myself with the credit card but i know i'm supposed to get the agreement in writing before sending any payment and it's probably too early anyway since she has never been delinquent on any of her accounts ever. i recently learned about debt counceling thru nfcc. but i'm clueless as what they can do for her besides lower interest rate and maybe lower payment?? can they decrease the total debt as well by negotiating with the companies themselves? i think this is the only way to prevent her credit history from impact? yet i've been doing some reading and see some pretty big cons about going thru this route and am now leaning against it. lastly, considering my moms age and income, there isn't future potential for payment. so i don't see why creditors would be adverse to settling, right?   right now my current  thinking is for her to pay off one of the cards by using a bank loan which offers her a low interest rate , then stop paying the other credit card entirely , to charge off.  wait for settlement offer she can do.  i figure walking away from one card is better than two?  not sure if this is a good idea, but making the minimum payments as they are now on two 10k balances, is no longer feasible.  any advice or feedback would be appreciated. i want to help her and want to make sure she does the right thing. even where to go for legit  advice would be appreciated...thank you.",32,1,Need help with 75 yr old mom's 20k debt,Finance

(12% for federal income tax; 15.3% for self-employment tax, and a little bit of a buffer). fast forward to my 2 questions: 1. how do i report this income on my 2020 taxes, and what should i get in writing from this family to ensure i have all the necessary information and details? i would think that i would file using a 1099-misc, but i am unsure if i have to provide this form or if this family will provide the form and information. we did not talk specifically about taxes or tax burden at the beginning of our working arrangement, which is a mistake i realize in hindsight!2. i had been lurking in the nanny reddit thread and was reading many posts about the grey issue of a ‘nanny tax’. it seems that the common theme was that a nanny is a household employee, and that the family ‘should’ be shouldering some amount of the employee taxes. it was also mentioned multiple times that treating a nanny as an independent contractor instead of a household employee was a type of tax evasion. question: do i raise this issue with the family? if they claim me through the company as a contractor, will there be negative legal action for me if that is disputed or uncovered? i am not willing to commit any portion of tax fraud and want to make sure i am not unknowingly messing up!i appreciate any feedback or thoughts; and apologies for formatting/spelling errors/ mistakes!",12,1,Nanny leaving my position; trying to sort out tax responsibility and 1099 v W2,Finance

7471,"this is to the tune of 100k plus 24k in credit card debt. he admits it was stupid but doesn't really seem to be sorry because he was trying to make big bucks for the family and really believes in these people. none of it is in writing, of course, nor did he fully understand his liability when he signed up for lines of credit for these people. he's even the ceo of an incorporated business on the other side of the country, which he was surprised to learn was ""noncompliant"" (hasn't paid registration i guess) on the secretary of state website. he's a phenomenally bad judge of character and poor decision-maker obviously. it's been this way all my life and my mom has stuck her head in the sand. this is however the first time he's actively lied to my mom that he wasn't giving people money (previously it was just lies of omission). he's always promised he wouldn't make big financial decisions without her.fortunately he's a bit of a pushover and has verbally agreed to cooperate with handing over all the financial decisions, although clearly his word isn't worth much. my mom has asked for my help in every way that i can. he is almost 80 and i know my mom and i aren't unique in being in this position. i love my dad but i've become a jaded b**** over the years watching him flush money down the toilet, and at this point i think he's willing to do almost anything in pursuit of funding these crazy schemes to recuperate his losses. my mom is talking how we need to curb his irresponsible spending like a $1200/mo storage unit, but i'm way more concerned about more imminent losses to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.for more context, my folks will be ok **if** we can nip his stupid investments and rampant spending in the bud. they have some equity on the house. i really believe he wants to be the hero here and isn't trying to screw over my mom and run. in fact 4k of the money he's lost went to me and my schooling. my bachelor's was at least half funded by him. how can my mom and i find all his secret assets, debts, income, expenses, liabilities, business involvements, or any other financial complications i can't even fathom, and keep him from taking out lines of credit or selling/draining any assets he possibly can? for starters the social security check will go to my mom and we will monitor his debit and credit account statements. they have joint bank accounts and both names are on the house. we need a complete picture of everything remotely related to their finance, including all the bills he pays with my mom's pension and the social security. as mentioned he's agreed to work with us, but he's still a snake who will try to hide anything. i'm guessing this situation will take an advisor and possibly an attorney. my dad was pretty old when i was born and i'm financially inexperienced beyond handling personal loans, income, and an apartment--i've never owned a house or been married, and i'm in way over my depth. my mom is pretty clueless. i hope neither i nor my mom will need to assume fiduciary responsibility such as one would for an elder with alzheimer's, just to make sure he can't do anything. hopefully all it will take is for my mom to finally face reality and make the tough decisions she's been dodging for decades. i don't know where to start and any advice would be beyond welcome.",12,1,"Dad has opened up lines of credit and drained bank accounts to fund his ""friends'"" crazy business schemes [CA]",Finance
7484,"i’m trying to look at the best way to have my house paid off by the time i retire. i’m currently 57, working and we have a household gross of $150k annually. i want to retire at 60 which is 30 months away. we owe $94k on our mortgage and if i changed nothing it’s be at $64k when i hit 60. we have no car payments, and pay off cc every month and an emergency fund of $35k. i’m saving 20% of my salary into a 401k and my employer kicks in 4%. at 60 i can expect a monthly income pre-tax of about $7800 counting 401k, military retirement, pensions and wife’s social security. i have some thoughts on what to do and i wanted some feedback. first option, i can realistically squeeze an additional $1400 monthly out of our budget to put towards the principal in addition to the regular monthly payment which would leave $24k payoff on the mortgage when i retire at 60 then use the excessive vacation payout i’ll get ($20-30k) towards the remaining principal and pay it off (i get 4 weeks a year and barely use 1week so it’s been accumulating with no cap). according to the amortization tables this option will save me $9k in mortgage interest.second option, i could do option above but work until i’m 61 and it would be paid off by that time using the monthly payment + $1400 principal payment. still saves $9k in interest.third option i could continue to save money, not make the extra principal payment letting the money accumulate in the bank and work until the money i saved to pay the mortgage equals the payoff balance. this is closer to 62 but with my wife being a few years older we really want to retire and travel in the us.is there something else i’m not thinking of?",15,1,Best route to pay off mortgage?,Finance
7638,"tl;dr at bottom following a decision to change careers after a bad grad job, i used up all my savings on a costly expensive unpaid internship and a master's degree. i then moved country to start a job. this was quite expensive. this left me with 10k in high interest debt which my parents agreed to pay off. i have been paying them back since getting a grad job beginning of this year. they aren't charging me interest luckily. in my job, i'm not paid amazingly but well enough so i have 5-600 a month left over for savings and other expenses like replacing my ageing laptop etc. the country i'm in is high tax, high welfare. therefore social security, health and retirement funding are mostly covered by my taxes. after a year or working i now owe about 5k to my parents, but also have no savings. my question is, is it better for me to focus the next year on paying off my remaining debt? or should i divide my leftover money between paying my parents back month by month over a long time, while saving with the other half? this would give me a savings cushion for a rainy day/unexpected expenses. while i'm leaning to this option, i'm also a bit nauseous thinking it would keep me in debt longer with a reduced net salary in that time. any advice is appreciated as i suck at personal finance matters and i really don't know what i'm doing :) tl; dr i owe 5k in 0 interest debt. should i focus on quickly paying it off? or should i pay it off over a long time while building savings? the second option is tempting but i realise it would give me a lower net income for a long time and keep me in debt longer.",7,1,Is it better to put my leftover income towards paying off a 0% interest loan or focus on building savings?,Finance
7927,"my parents (green card holders/permanent resident) aged 55 and 57 recently moved to the us (&lt;2 years) after retiring in their home country and selling their main assets. i have been working with them to plan a reasonable retirement route in the us and have some questions about how to set them up with the cash they already have at hand.  background info on assets/finances from home country:they both have state pensions that amount to \~12k usd each. the currency is very weak against dollar and continues to lose value, so we certainly do not rely on this pension to cover them in their retirement. as far as we know it might completely disappear at this rate.they have some properties, mostly empty land for investment as inflation in their home country didn't make it viable to invest their money any other way at the time. the value of these properties are currently unknown to me but again - while they can help if liquidated, i am not counting on them as continuous reliable sources of income (not just yet).  assets in the us:2 rental homes that net around 16k on a good year (without home repairs or lapse in tenancy). they are however considering selling one of the rental homes that only net 4k (the other nets 12k), due to it's location and other factors. the listing price would be around 120k.  2 relatively newer cars that are paid off. 1 home (their residence) with a 210k mortgage (3.125%, 30 year).1 401k account with 22k balance (17.5 is vested currently).1 high yield savings account with about 220k.income:around 40k each without over time. \~45k with over time. (gross salary) they are not relying on the over time since it can be taxing at their age.our current plan is for them to continue working at least until they each complete 10 years to be eligible for social security payments later.mom contributes 20% of her salary to 401k and dad just became eligible to open a 401k account which will start in jan with a 10% contribution. they are very careful with their finances and save rigorously. they are able to pretty much live off of one salary income and save the other. currently they save in cash due to old habits (not trusting banks/ investment options). mom is very debt averse so she wants to pay off the mortgage, which i prevented her from doing because that would consume all their liquid assets. whenever they put 10k aside, mom would like to pay it towards their mortgage.  i have convinced them to gradually increase their 401k contributions to a point they feel comfortable with the take home pay (possibly 40-50% or more of their income to max out their 401k). in the mean time, they have an additional 15k saved up in their checking and i am wondering whether they should open traditional iras now and contribute their max in 2020 asap while mom wants to pay if towards their mortgage. with that being said, i know traditional ira contribution tax deduction phases out after a certain magi. since this is the first year that they have fully been in the us generating income, i can't really figure out their magi with the foreign income/rental income/w2 income. therefore i am not sure if traditional ira makes sense right now.   what would be a good way to set them up for retirement in 10 years hopefully but with enough cushion that if they can't make it to social security threshold, they can still have a reliable stream of income?specific questions:how should we invest the 220k in the high yield savings account? pay it towards mortgage? open a brokerage account? something else?same question for the hypothetical 120k if they sell one of their rental homes.should they open traditional iras and fully fund in 2020?should they max out their 401ks reducing their liquid savings generation significantly?should they prioritize mortgage payments?should they consider other options that i haven't even thought of?thank you!",0,1,Looking for advice on retirement planning for parents who recently moved to the US.,Finance

9814,"hey all - i'm just very perplexed about how to proceed with this. my wife has gotten periodic calls about a debt that isn't hers.the first call came about twelve years ago. this was shortly after we were married and her name was changed. they had her maiden name, social security number, and an address that her mother had lived in while my wife was in college (but that my wife never used). we really don't believe her mother stole her identity - while that's always a possibility, it's very unlikely given the family situation.the people on the phone made it sound like was a legit debt and we made the mistake of giving them a credit card over the phone to pay it off (something like $100, we figured let's just get this off our record).over the years, she'd periodically get similar calls, always using her maiden name, always listing that as her address. we've ignored them.today she got another round of them. she has the cell phone plan for the whole family in her name, and we all got calls. it's this serious sounding voicemail that says she has pending litigation and that she has a right to contact the plaintiff before a lawsuit is filed.i decided to call and talk to the people. the first guy tried to get info out of me, which i wouldn't give him and he said, ""good luck in court"" and hung up. i called back. the second lady was a little nicer (at first). i explained that if it's a legit debt i'd pay it off today, but that i think it's not correct. she disclosed that it was an online payday loan lender and the debt was taken out  about seven years ago (long after i had paid off that previous debt collector with the same address). this new debt would be many years after my wife changed her name and many years after her mother was no longer living at the address they have on file.this would all be fine, but the thing that confuses me is that the lady didn't seem to try hard at all to get me to pay what they're asking for. she didn't even give me an amount. she said that her client would rather take me to court because they will get more money that way and that she is a ""mediator,"" and that they have to mediate before going to court. she wouldn't provide any documentation about the debt and said i could request it in discovery. she got very rude at the end and ultimately hung up on me. she had told me that the total they will sue me for is around $1500 and the current settlement offer is lower than that (but she didn't say what it was).but none of this makes sense. why didn't she pressure me to take a settlement amount on the phone? are they really going to bother suing over such a relatively small amount of money? $1500 hardly seems worth the trouble.we pulled my wife's credit report and this debt doesn't show up on there. we've purchased two homes since the original loan was supposedly taken out. both times we had to pay off weird things that popped up on the credit report, but this obviously never came up.my bullshit detector is high on this one, but i can't seem to figure out what the scam is, if it is a scam. i would have expected her to pressure me to pay something on the phone, and while she left it hanging as an option, she almost steered me away from it.also, it's worth noting that she didn't ask for our current address when i told her the address she has is an address that my never has never lived at. she said that once filed in court, the court will determine her current address and will serve her there or at her place of employment.can anyone shed any light on what's actually going on? thanks!",13,1,Weird debt collection attempt (maybe stolen identity?),Finance

10687,"i will attempt to give as much relevant information here in a brief description. i just started to get my finances back on track before this unexpected pregnancy occurred. i am now so nervous about financial stability that i cannot even enjoy the news of becoming a father.i am financially literate, and most of my life i have been in a good position. i keep a detailed budget, and can tell you where every single penny was spent for the entirety of 2019. when covid hit back in march, i went off the rails due to depression, anxiety, and losing any type of social enjoyment (i am a very social creature). within a few months, all of my $5k in savings was cleaned out, and i racked up almost $15k in consumer debt. prior to this, my credit score was 760 and still to this day i have not missed a single payment in about 3+ years. i dug myself a huge hole and will never make that mistake again.my (26m) girlfriend (25f) have been together for 6 years and lived together for 3. i set up a great plan to knock out almost all of my consumer debt, and save enough to buy an engagement ring by the end of 2021, and have a child by the end of 2022. things change. our families are great, and they are emotionally supportive, but in no way can be financially supportive.quick notes before detailing my budget below,1. i live in a high col area (think nyc).2. will be expecting about $900 cash next month from stim check and other means.3. will be expecting about $3k - $5k cash after taxes for bonus in march with a slight raise.4. auto lease/insurance ends in july. will not be getting a car afterwards as it is not needed.5. baby should be due around jul-aug, my girlfriend should be getting maternal leave, but the goal  moving forward is to live off my income while she stays at home since child care is stupid expensive. i really want to get my girlfriend an engagement ring beforehand, and she will really want one, too. i think i'd be willing to pay the additional interest charges on consumer debt down the road if it means a ring within the next few months. a weekend job for me is a possibility.6. we just found out about the pregnancy a few days ago, and i have not done any research yet into how much a child will cost me, so it is not currently included in my budget.7. rent lease ends july 2022 for our studio apartment (yes, i know. it is *very* nice and more spacious than most, but still a studio. we will make it work).8. the budget includes what i deem *necessary*. adjustable net income will be money left to allocate between consumer debt/savings/discretionary expenses.let's get started.# balances - current**liquid assets                                 2,115***checking accounts*                        *1,640**liquid bank savings accounts        475***consumer debt                          15,685** *credit card #1                             8,030    (apr 0% until 3/15/21 – then 20%)**credit card #2                                185    (apr 18%)**credit card #3                                850    (apr 21%)* *credit card #4                             5,280    (apr 0% until 12/31/21 – then 21%)**personal loan                             1,340   (apr 11%)*&amp;#x200b;# budget – current until july 2021**net income                                    4,080****living expenses**                            **2,330***rent                                            1,580**utilities                                          125**auto loan                                     245**auto insurance                               80**groceries/toiletries/supplies       250* *laundry                                           50***mandatory debt obligations**      **170***student loan #1                           170***adjustable net income             1,580**&amp;#x200b;# budget - effective july 2021 and absorbing full living expenses **net income                                  4,490****living expenses**                           **3,235***rent                                            2,600**utilities                                          185**groceries/toiletries/supplies       400* *laundry                                           50***mandatory debt obligations**     **310***student loan #1                           170**student loan #2                           140***adjustable net income                945**&amp;#x200b;i can really use some advice. thank you all!",4,1,Unexpected pregnancy and currently swimming in consumer debt.

10896,"tl;dr—sat down and made a retirement plan with mom, would love pointers, particularly on 3) next steps.hi all! i am seeing similar posts, so i'm glad i'm not alone on this one.**background**: i (m31) started a new job, and have been doing a deep dive on home-buying, housing finance, health benefits, and... retirement. i started ping-ponging thoughts off my mom (f63). i got a little panicky because she didn't have answers to any basic questions, like ""when do you plan to retire,"" ""what is your mortgage's balance,"" ...""do you have a pension."" she is the world's best mom and very smart. however she self-admittedly has no financial skills whatsoever, and never touched the topic of her retirement with a 12ft pole until today. thank god for pensions and social security or there'd be nothing there (i cringe for future generations...). she also raised my brother and i alone, so i think she just didn't have the bandwidth.so today we did a zoom with her more retirement-oriented coworker to 1) do a full accounting of retirement/non-retirement assets and income, 2) retirement costs, and 3) decide next steps/modifications. would love to hear your thoughts/suggestions.1) **accounting of assets and income****available funds** (before taxes):* pension—if mom retires at age... 63: $4.7k/mo; 68: $5.9k/mo; 73: $7.1k/mo   * ""cap money"" (idk)—$10k lump sum* fidelity accounts   * $19,789 lump sum (past, no longer active defined contribution)   * 403(b)—voluntary fund; $0* social sec estimator: if mom retires at age... 63: $1706; 68: $2259; 70: $3183.* checking in with prior employer from 20+ yrs ago about anything that may have vested**houses**: * residence: interest rate is 5%, balance is $192,000, monthly payment is $1636. no prepayment penalty. redfin values house at $711k.* grandma's house: paid off. redfin values at $2.7m. would be split between grandma's 4 children including mom, and their kids. the two more financially savvy sibs want to sell when that happens, so i reckon we will, but i think that will be a while off (my family lives forever). rent currently pays for grandma's assisted living.**savings**: none. **income**: $115k. has already emotionally accepted working through age 73 or working e.g. a 10-hr job in retirement if neccessary, and i would be very surprised if that proved to be a struggle based on her current health but who knows.2) **retirement costs**:* mortgage: some 20 years left, is open to paying down early.   * $500/mo (!) hoa fee (the crook property manager was just fired and the new one is good, so hopefully this drops).    * $400/yr home insurance.    * slim to none on non-hoa interior home maintenance.* car payments: some 7 years left, is open to paying down early.* coworker estimated $100/mo plan on top of medicare.* groceries, clothes, occasional restaurants etc. in one of the highest col areas in the us (she and everyone we know is around here so don't bother suggesting a move). * family vacations 1x/yr.3) **next steps/modifications.** we are thinking shoot for retirement at 73, which would suggest a monthly \~$10,300 before taxes between ss and pension ($120k/yr). this seems high now, but by the rule of thumb of losing 50% to inflation every 20 years, that's maybe $40k when she's 93, right? (again, family prob all living into 90s.)* see about any vested funds from prior employer* get mom to start attending her work's free retirement webinars* refinance residence: bring the 5% down to 2-3%. keeping it fixed cost, no fees/prepayment fees (she has \~800 credit). total black box to me, suggestions welcome.* start a $200/mo contribution to her empty 403(b) to start, see if we want to increase it later; see about investing that and her lump sum in a low-risk mutual fund of some kind so she has at least one retirement asset that isn't fully vulnerable to inflation. maybe add cap money and prior employer money (if any) to this too)* think about paying off car/house early. i suggest doing both this and 403(b), but i assessed that 403(b) should be prioritized over debt, since roi significantly &gt; mortgage rate and since 403(b) pays taxes post-investment, but open to direction there. maybe even $40k/yr is fine once you have no house to pay off, even with high col and health costs, and i'm just being paranoid. idk, i have no sense..any other suggestions? thanks folks. i've been here a short while and am already learning a lot. sorry for length.",21,1,Soliciting Tips on Plan for Mom's Retirement,Finance

it's why i even have the emergency fund i do now, and why i have some investments in the market. but i feel like everything may come crashing down and i don't want to make any stupid moves. i renegotiated my rent so i can stay here through next year and the pandemic's hopeful end (god please!!). i have enough between my parent's social security money + the savings i have to forcefully conjure to keep us living here comfortably for another year. i had to renegotiate my rent at a bit of a higher price. of course, the landlords are taking advantage of everything somehow going up in price while people are suffering, but it was about $1k difference and i didn't think it would be worth having to look for a new place. now i am also running into dental issues and think i'll need to use at least $2k to make sure i can keep my teeth longterm. now i'm eating into my own emergency fund, and i know it's an emergency fund, but it's the only cash i have left of my inheritance, about $10k. i don't even know what i'm asking for. i do not want to end up in poverty. i'm a somewhat intelligent person. i have a college degree. i went through hard times and it has thrown me into a dimension where everything is hard. i have to fight against a parent that acts like a child when it comes to budgeting and spending. i am 31 and i want a life. i want a career and to be married someday, but sometimes i feel like i'm raising my mother, and that i am so, so behind and it's so hard to see that this will all be a memory someday and i will have the life i want. can someone please tell me this isn't that bad and there's a way out? i don't know what i'm looking for!

(also to get feedback if i'm missing anything)&amp;#x200b;when saving for retirement, often your best option is a 401k or roth 401k because you don't pay taxes on the gains. however, there are limits to how much you can contribute. if you are fortunate enough to believe you will be able to save more than enough money for retirement, then there is an option to create what i call a ""faux roth 401k"" with any money that you don't need before you die. and this ""faux roth 401k"" has no contribution limits.&amp;#x200b;to create this ""faux roth 401k"", you simply invest the money into a indefinite-term investment like a s&amp;p 500 index fund\*. you will never have to pay taxes on the gains as long as you don't sell it. when you retire, you live off other funds (like your 401k, social security, pension if lucky). as long as you don't need to touch that money by the time you die, the person who inherits it receives a ""step-up"" in basis that eliminates any tax owed.  **therefore no one ever needs to pay tax on the gains**.&amp;#x200b;it's a low-risk strategy.  if you miscalculate, then you can sell some of the stock to fund your retirement (but pay taxes on it). also, if you die younger than expected, then your children (or whoever) will inherit more money than if you had been paying capital gains taxes your whole life.&amp;#x200b;compare this to a strategy of buying and selling individual stocks. every time you sell a stock for a gain, you have to pay taxes. every time you sell a stock for a loss, you can offset stock/capital gains (but only in the same year), but only up to $3,000 in ordinary income. therefore, to beat an index fund with individual stocks that you buy &amp; sell, not only do you have to ""beat the street"" (which is hard to do), **you have to ""beat the street""** ***after you pay taxes on your capital gains income***.&amp;#x200b;\*obviously, if you can find a stock that you are confident will be a winner over your whole life (hard to do!) and that you will **never** need to sell, then that can be as good or better than an index fund.",7,1,Tax-free investing for your heirs using an Index Fund,Finance

15788,"hello,before i start explaining my situation, i want everybody to understand that i know i should only be spending 33% of my income on rent, but i'm currently at around 43%. i'm fine with sacrificing a few wants to afford this. i know many of you will be commenting about this, but i completely understand what i'm sacrificing.now then, i've been working on a general overview of my future budget, and i need a sanity check. i've bolded the important bits to make it a bit easier to skim through. sorry about the wall of text :)i'm 20.i have a **$6k credit limit** across a few credit cards. my score used to be around 750, but it dropped 56 points when my student loans were reported, so now **my score hovers around 700**. i have a year and a month of credit history and a total of **$2750 in debt** (student loans after grants &amp; scholarships). i have about 1 semester left for my b.s., so i should be finished by july of 2021. i don't plan on taking any more loans for college, and my current **loans do not accumulate interest until i'm no longer in college**. should i pay it off now? would it be better for my credit to pay it off when i get out of school?i work 50 hours a week on a **$13/hour** job (i don't get burned out easily). 10 of those hours are $19.50/hour. this means that i make about **$2.9k/month before taxes**. i've opted to block tax withholding so that i can put what little i owe each year into an investment account to make a few bucks. i'm **included in my father's medical, dental, and vision until i'm 26**, so i don't plan on taking any from my employer aside from 401(k). my employer matches **dollar for dollar up to 3%**. my state has **no income tax,** thankfully, so after deducting about 11% for social security and medicare tax, 401(k), and the $2.4k i've estimated that i'd owe each year in federal income tax, i make about **$31k/year** or $2,580/month. on top of all of this, **i expect a pay raise to at least $15/hour in a month or two.**i plan on renting an apartment with my so sometime in february or march. **rent will be $1,100/month**. a bit pricey for my income, but the place is definitely worth it. built in 2019, and it's gorgeous. stainless steel appliances, 300mbps up/down &amp; cable included in rent, washer &amp; dryer also included. i can't find a better place anywhere nearby, so i'm willing to sacrifice a few wants to afford it. my so does not currently have a job, but it'll likely be much easier to afford when she does. to those of you who are likely to comment about how living together might strain our relationship: **we've already been living together for the last 2 years.** her parents offered to take me in until i was stable enough to move out as my family lives pretty far away. they treat me like their own child, so i'm very appreciative of them.i'm budgeting $13.2k/year for rent, $1.7k/year for auto insurance &amp; maintenance, $2.4k/year for savings, $6k/year for food, $2.1k/year for utilities, and $1.2k/year for household items, and $3.7k/year for personal expenses. personal expenses include monthly services (all of which i can forego if i need to) and $2.9k/year in restaurants ($60/week). my total expenses are $30,290/year, leaving me with about **$60/month left over**. i can cut into savings for clothing, as i don't see that as a regular purchase. my father is a bro and said he'd pay for my phone plan to help me out until i'm more stable.**i own a vehicle,** and i have about **$1.7k saved**. by the time i start renting the apartment, i'll have around $5k saved. i plan to put everything leftover into savings until i reach $8k, at which point i'll bring it down to $150-200/month.[here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/vkwt6js.png) of my current budgeting spreadsheet. is there anything i'm missing? anything i should be doing differently? any additional advice?thanks in advance!",8,1,Budget sanity check,Finance

17256,"my wife recently passed away and our son is receiving monthly social security death benefits until he turns 18. the death benefits can be used to pay for his expenses (home, food, clothes, medical care, etc). my original plan was to not spend any of the money and instead invest it for him so when he turns 18 he will have a significant amount of money available to him. i'm fortunate enough to be able to afford all of his expenses without needing to use the ssa death benefits. the concern i have about this plan is that when he turns 18, he will have access to all of the money. i don't think it is a good idea for an 18 year old to have over $200k available to them. just seems like there is some potential for trouble. i'm trying to find ways of having more control over when he receives the money. one idea would be to use the death benefits for his expenses. use it for his food, clothes, home expenses, entertainment, etc. for every dollar i spent out of his death benefits, i would match it out of my personal money and invest it under an account that i owned. if i used $500 of his death benefits to pay his expenses, then i would contribute $500 of my own money in an investment account. while the account would be mine, the plan would be to give him the money when i felt he was ready for it. could even trickle it out based on certain ages. maybe he gets $10,000 when he is 18, $50,000 when he is 24 and the rest when he turns 30. just as an example. there would probably be some taxing downsides to that. i'd have to pay the taxes on capital gains. if it was under his name, he wouldn't since he wouldn't be making enough each year to file taxes. i could put it into a 529 savings account, but he already has a healthy 529 account to pay for college in the future. is this a good idea/bad idea? does anyone have other ideas?",28,8,Investing Social Security death benefits for child,Finance

18261,"long post here:i need some advice about what i think is a pretty complicated situation.my father passed away unexpectedly just over a week ago. my sister and i had planned to do a will for both him and my mom this year, but it didn’t happen. his assets are 2.85 acres of land on which sits a very dilapidated, shack of a home built in the late 1940s. this house has not been cleaned in over a decade and has a significant issue with mold, rodent infestation, and dog use and abuse. at least one of the windows is broken, the front porch bending and unstable, the kitchen water drains into the backyard, the well that provides water to house constantly is having issues with rain water intrusion and making their water turn brown and unpotable. my parents were hoarders and didn’t have room in the 560 sq. foot house for all their tools, and small gadgets and dirty clothes. we just found out the washing machine had been broken for well over a year so my mom was trying to wash her clothes in the shower tub with very little success. my mother is very obese, in her mid-50s, and has received disability benefits for 30+ years due to a host of physical ailments and conditions that would almost assuredly prevent her from earning money from working.my dad took out a loan on the land (\~$10k) a few years ago and they are current on the payments ($410/month with over a 20% interest rate due to their very low credit). the property is deeded to my father only and the loan was in his name only as well. in my state, intestate law states that the land will go to the surviving spouse and equal shares of the descendants (1/3 my mom, 1/3 me, and 1/3 my sister).we think we may have found a place for my mother to live that she can afford with her monthly social security benefit payment close to us where we can help her get to her doctor appointments and help her mentally/physically with visiting her often. when my father was alive, they were both enablers and became very isolated, further exacerbating their physical issues, and their crippling depression.my sister and i are planning to contribute financially to my mother and her new living arrangements around ($300/month), but we are looking for my mother to be as independent as possible as quickly as possible.the current property is \~3 miles from a very popular lake used for recreation. the land is zoned agricultural residential 3 (ar3) and is surrounded by new development but it is still in a very rural area. the property appraised by the tax assessor’s office in 2020 was $32,650. i haven’t hired an agent yet but i do believe that is a bit lower than what the market could fetch.my brother-in-law, a builder and an avid fisherman, believes that the acreage and proximity to the lake would bode well for rehabbing the home and operating as a rental property and source of income for both my mother and our family.this is a delicate situation because of the emotional aspects involved but we want to make the best decision for the future of my mother and this land has been in my family for at least 4 generations, so i don’t want to sell the land to just satisfy the loan if the value will continue to go up (as we expect).should we pay off the balance of the loan with agreement that we would continue to buy my mother’s and sister’s share of the land? we can’t buy both of their shares of the land right now but we can make payments every month.should we just continue to make the $410/month payment with the understanding that we (my wife and i) will control more equity in the land?should we sell it all and put the profit in a fund for my mom’s living expenses for the next few years?should we rehab the home and look to subdivide the land?should we rehab the home to rent it out and try to put a few more smaller homes there and rent those out as well to generate income for my mother to live on and improve her living arrangements with more care?is there any solution to this quagmire that i’m not already thinking about?tl;dr my father died without a will and he had some land and a house that should be condemned and my family is trying to figure out what to do with it to benefit everyone.",10,1,Dad passed away-left us land with a loan on it-what to do?,Finance

24077,"so this morning i woke up to a text from one of those real id phishing scam text messages: ""az-dot your driver's license required to meet with our new regulation-compliant update.visit: (link)"". this was all perfect timing as i was already expecting something important from the dmv about my license. so, in my groggy, worried state, i mindlessly clicked on the link, entered my name, address, social and email into the website and clicked submit. it was in that moment i realized what i had just done. what i did: after having the freak out of my life, i promptly called the ftc to file a report that my information had been compromised. then i called the 3 major credit unions to freeze my credit. lastly i changed my passwords. what i tried to do: i called the police department to file a report, but since a crime has not been committed yet, there was nothing to report. i also called the irs, and likewise, since a crime has not been committed there's nothing they could do. to my knowledge, these are all the steps i can take. but who knows if i'm forgetting a crucial step here. i was about to finance a truck, so this couldn't happen at a worse time. so here are my questions: have i done everything i can? how long should i keep fraud alerts for my accounts once i unfreeze them? how often do you have to renew these fraud alerts? how long will this affect me, and will i have to live the rest of my life worried that someone is waiting to use my ssn? what else should i look out for moving forward (financing a car, opening an account, buying a house, etc)?i'm in my mid 20s, and ignorant regarding most things finance, so any info about this is appreciated. thank you",10,2,"I gave my SSN away to a scammer, now what?",Finance

24701,"this is really hard to put in a title, so i'm going to try to explain it here. also, i am resubmitting this post to meet sub rules on mentioning... current events. **tl;dr at bottom.****context:**i was born in canada, and while my mom is fully canadian, my dad is fully american. my dad registered me as a us citizen born abroad a few months after i was born, but never really explained it to my mom. when i was 2 years old, my mom and i moved to texas to be with my dad. things only lasted a few months, however, and i came back to canada with my mom. i have never lived in the us since then, and have never worked in the us. however, at some point, i got a us ssn in my name. this might have happened when i was a newborn, when i was registered as a us citizen born abroad. but regardless, i didn't know at the time and neither did my mom. my mom never saw the papers, and while i wound up getting photocopies a few years ago, i didn't really realize what situation i was in. over the years, a lot of stuff happened that was never fully explained to me. either that, or the laws changed sometime in the last 10 years.over the years my family in the usa would talk about my citizenship from time to time when i went to visit them, and told me about all the cool stuff i was eligible for. free passage between both countries, a us passport that i could get, the ability to live and work in both countries, and so on. my aunt, who worked for the irs, actually went and set me up with... some ""things"" that automod does not like me saying, but i am apparently the beneficiary for some ""things"". you can likely guess what they are. i don't think it's worth too much, but they exist and my aunt pulled them up on the computer when i was a kid and showed me that they would be mine one day. i don't think i'm legally responsible for them right now. but to make a long story short, my family also told me that i would not have to pay taxes on anything unless/until i ""claimed"" the benefits of my citizenship by doing something ""active"". like moving or working in the us, voting, or claiming my ""things"" from my aunt. and my aunt worked for the irs, so this seemed like solid info. but this was over 10 years ago.anyway, after many years and getting a canadian passport - but not being able to claim dual citizenship because my mom and i didn't have the papers - my dad gave me this stack of photocopies. i think i was about 18. the front page was a document showing that i'm a us citizen born abroad, and it was dated to when i was a newborn. then, a bunch of pages of legal-ese looking papers followed, that i stupidly ignored. i tucked them away in my room. my ssn was on the back page and i just found it yesterday.**situation:**so flash forward to this week, i am 24 years old. due to current events in the financial world, i decided that i wanted to set aside a small, fixed budget and open an account related to these events (which automod does not like me mentioning.) however, when i go to sign up, i see a warning asking me if i have any claims to us citizenship in any way, or any possible chance i could be within ""us tax residency"". this sends me down a rabbit hole. i decided to pull out my photocopies from my dad, since this account said that i was legally obligated to disclose my us ssn if i had one. sure enough, i found a photocopy of my ssn on the back page of this stack, and it's definitely mine. i decided to go research why this canadian account is asking me to claim a us ssn to open a canadian account... i thought that since i've never lived or worked in the us, i didn't have to do anything with it. after all, my aunt who worked for the irs told me as a child that i was fine unless if i decided to move or work in the us and basically ""activate"" it. so i vaguely knew already that i had a ssn, but it never crossed my mind that often because i thought i hadn't ""activated"" it yet by ""using"" my us citizenship.anyway, to make a long story short, i think i might be in trouble. i've been faithfully filing my taxes yearly to the cra (canada revenue agency) ever since i turned 18, with no problems at all. but i've never filed anything with the irs. i've never done anything to ""use"" my citizenship like vote, open a us account, buy major property (unless if those ""things"" my aunt got me used this ssn without me knowing), or received any benefits like social supports. also, here in canada, i wouldn't call myself wealthy. i have an emergency fund and enough money to pay the bills and my student loan. but i'm very frugal, live with family, and use public transport. i'm just a few months away from paying off my student loan. i work almost full time (was full time pre-covid) in food service, and earn a few dollars above minimum wage. other than my chequing and savings accounts, the only ""special"" things i have are my student loan and a credit card that i faithfully pay off every month. when i do my tax returns, i always got refunds, and have never owed taxes that i had to pay. we'll see about this year because i'm out of school right now and working.so... this is where i'm at right now. i've never filed a thing with the irs, since i've never lived or worked in the us in my entire conscious life. but i think i might be in trouble now. my us family always told me i didn't have to file unless i ""used"" my citizenship, but now i'm not so sure. tonight i'm going to reach out to my dad and my aunt and see if they know anything. i need to ask my dad if he has the original documents (because the ones i have are bad photocopies and some stuff is cut off), and i need to ask my aunt who worked for the irs if she knows what i'm supposed to do. that, and the ""things"". so... my question is on what i'm supposed to do now. am i in a lot of trouble or do i just need to file what i missed? should i brace for fines? i'm reaching out to family but i'm really lost on what my next steps are. if any. however, i do want to get this sorted out, one way or another.**tl;dr: i'm a canadian/us dual citizen, who lives and works in canada only. my dad registered me for a ssn when i was born, as an american citizen born ""abroad"", but i only lived in the us for a few months as a baby. i have full dual citizenship to both countries and have not revoked either one. i'm 24 now, and have never filed us taxes with the irs, because i thought i only had to file canadian taxes. am i in trouble? what now?**",111,1,"(CAN / USA) I'm a Canadian / US dual citizen from birth, but have never lived or worked in the US.

27540,"m29, single, looking to buy as soon as this summer. am i ready?i'm in a hcol city where a decent 1bd condo in an appreciating neighborhood goes for around $425k-$475k. based on affordability calculators, that's right in my sweet spot. i *could* get more house on the dollar in the burbs, but, as a single young(ish) adult, staying near the urban core is still advantageous for me from a dating and social life perspective. i don't need much more than a 1bd condo anyway.my plan *had* been to save until i had a 20% dp to avoid pmi. but given low interest rates and rapid appreciation in this market, i'm considering buying once i can do 10%, which would get me into the market a year (or more) sooner. i think my pmi would be reasonable given my strong credit score, and that i'd be able to drop it fairly quickly thanks to expected appreciation. plus, with interest rates so low the math may favor making a lower dp in order to invest the difference into the market, even with the pmi accounted for.how do i look? what am i not accounting for?* salary: $117k base salary, eligible for 15% annual bonus.* debts: $0. had student loans and a car note, but all are paid off* dp saved: $35k. i deposit $2.5k monthly. * emergency fund: $12k. this is 6mo based of current *living* *expenses*, but i'm adding \~$1.4k monthly in order to reach 6mo of *take home pay* by the time i buy.* retirement: $65k between a 401k and roth ira. i put in 10% and employer matches 4%. i have zero desire to touch the principal or adjust my savings rate to make buying a home work.* hsa: \~$3,550 after fully funding for one year. intend to fully fund this year too.based on all the above, june would be when: my dp hits 10% *and* my ef hits 6mo take home pay. additionally, my annual bonus (\~12k after taxes) should hit by the end of may, which i'd use to cushion closing and moving costs. seems like there's no reason not to buy this summer, but hoping for either some validation or tough love, whichever may apply.thanks so much for the input!",4,1,Gut check on buying a home?,Finance

303,"my dad, who was absent for most of his life, passed away in october. my lawyer (formerly his lawyer) found some things in one of his old files. one was a letter addressed to his kids. it was a list of life tips. this is what she scanned it to me.1.  call your mom once a week; no more, no less.2.  do your laundry on quarter draft night (the laundry room will be empty). fold your clothes before you put them away. don't use liquid fabric softener on towels, they will shed water like a well oiled duck. wash your sheets on thursday (you never know).3.  keep your dorm room clean. don't use febreze.4.  don't drive if you can ride the bus; don't ride the bus if you can bike; don't bike if you can walk.5.  don't study in the library stacks; too many people will walk around and disturb you. study in the asian heritage section; no one ever goes in there.6.  take the time to find the hidden burrito place; it will save your life when you're really hungry and it's a good place to take someone on the first date.7.  get a work study job in the library if you can; food service work study will make you angry.8.  don't try to study outside.9.  don't defend your music/book/movie/political tastes by attacking another's.10. don't take up smoking as a habit, no matter what.11. write notes on anything and everything.12. don't buy one of those nifty id cases with a keyring attached.13. don't fall for the easy student credit card applications.14. learn the name of the janitor who cleans your dorm and your class buildings.15. your first roommate is the first person you meet on campus. it's also the first person you will have disagreements with. remember, he will be gone at the end of the year, but you'll remember him for the rest of your life.16. get stupid-loud-emotional-puking drunk once. once is all it takes.17. learn to be homesick, but do it alone.18. you will get horribly, terribly, awfully sick at some point during your first semester. don't try to fight it or deny that it will happen to you. go to the clinic, get some anti-biotics and let it happen. it will save you for the next 4 years.19. only order take-out once a month. tip the delivery guy well (30-50%, he's most likely a student like you working his way through school).20. walk to bars; take a cab home.21. never drink alone in your room.22. if you find yourself in a townie bar, have one beer, tip the bartender well and leave. if you go back, the bartender won't ask you for your drink order, he or she will just set it up on the bar for you without asking. it's an amazing thing to see when someone in service treats you with respect. return it.23. find time to go to the gym.24. study two hours for every hour in class.25. eat in the dining hall. avoid foods that don't involve silverware. don't carb load at breakfast, eat a good-sized lunch, and don't overdo it at dinner. sit down, eat slow. it should take about an hour per meal.26. there are 168 hours in every week. subtract all of the class, study, gym, and eating time. you'll find that you won't be able to sleep 8 hours everyday. this is life, and it will prepare you for adulthood. nothing interesting happens while you sleep, if it does, you shouldn't have been asleep in the first place.27. your professors (the ones with dr. in front of their names or ph. d. after) are your first employers. learn what you need to learn but question them if it doesn't fit. in the end, they will be your job references after college.28. your graduate assistants and adjuncts are your peers. they have a lot of useful and pertinent information about how to get through these four years and in the end, the good ones will become your friends. some of my good friends were once my ga's and adjuncts and we still chat frequently.29. you will have veterans in your classes. some folks around you will dismiss their training and experience. they have real world knowledge and have earned your respect.30. drink cheap beer when offered (bud light, miller lite, coors light). drink good beer at the bar (sam adams, dos equis, heineken). keep better beer in your fridge (murphy's, bass, flat tire).31. wean yourself off caffeine during finals week. this may sound counter-intuitive, but trust me on this one.32. you are not entitled to your opinion, you're only entitled to what you can defend.33. you don't deserve a good grade for showing up. you didn't pay for ""a""s, you paid for the seat. effort pays off, attendance is part of that. it's your money, make sure its well spent.34. find your professors' offices and learn their hours; you'll need them.35. accept that you will make mistakes and ask for help. it's easier to recover this way than trying to handle it on your own.36. be firm in your convictions; if you don't believe in something, chances are, you'll believe anything.37. there is always a quiet place in the student center. you can usually nap there during the day.38. when you're walking, keep your feet, but keep your head up. you'll be amazed at how many people will greet you when they can see your face.39. don't judge anyone by the anything other than their actions. you don't know their story, just as they don't know yours.40. don't text someone in the same room as you. if it can't be said aloud, it can wait until you're in private.41. don't email someone in the same building. get up, walk to where ever he or she is and tell them face to face.42. not everything needs to be said. you'll learn what these things are as you go along.43. don't refuse an invitation to meet someone's parents. shake their hands and refer to them as sir and/or ma'am until/unless they tell you otherwise. not before.44. your first summer job will set you up for success for the rest of your college career.46. go to the free concerts on campus.47. become a football fan.48. the other people around you are in the same situation as you are. they are all scared, excited, tired, and apprehensive. you are learning how to adult; its a process; drive it when you can, but more importantly let it happen. the only thing you control are your own actions.49. listen to music at a moderate volume in your dorm room with the door open and without headphones. good conversation starter.50. volunteer.51. understand what social location is, then pay no attention to it.52. buy a tailored suit.53. it will probably be required, but even if it isn't, take a sports class.54. don't eat from the vending machines. buy a package of your favorite snack and hide it.55. hide money in the pockets of your clean clothes.56. when people hang out in your room, don't let them sit on your bed. during this time in your life when personal space is virtually non-existent, your bed is the closest thing to a sanctuary that you will have.57. make sure people take their garbage with them when they leave. this includes emotional garbage.58. the required classes fill up early. learn what a ""force add"" is and use it.59. wear shower shoes in the shower.60. wear house shoes unless you're leaving the building.61. own a crazy set of pajamas. wear them to your earliest final every semester.62. send your mother a birthday card every year.63. don't let your personal life become a hassle for your roommates or your ra. they are students too.64. don't try to drill a hole in the keg to get to the beer inside. a repair bill for the consequences is not a joke. trust me on this one.65. sit in the front of the class.66. wear a hat and a heavy coat when the weather gets cold; a hoodie won't cut it.67. wear shorts whenever possible.68. flip flops are perfectly acceptable. crocs are never acceptable.69. get up early on the weekends. your monday self will thank you.70. learn how to fix your own appliances. youtube and a good parts website will keep you from accumulating a storage bin full of easily repaired coffee makers.71. dress for dinner on friday nights and encourage your friends to do the same. jacket and tie for the men and a skirt/dress just above the knee for the ladies. even if you’re eating in the dining halls, this will attract the right people to your sphere.",0,1,From my dad,Adult

1097,"i turned 20 a little over 2 weeks ago. up until now, i’ve been focusing on my education above all else. i’m a chemistry major with a 3.9 gpa (so far). after college, i’m going into the navy. after the navy, i’m going into grad school. after grad school, i’m going on to do overworked, underpaid research jobs for the rest of my life. it’s not exactly a glamorous, or even “successful” future, but hey- i like science.  meanwhile, i’m in my physical and sexual prime. i’m young, smooth, supple, and i’ve got a beautiful body fitting of greek divinity. i’m exaggerating a bit, but i really am in great health and great shape. i worked hard for it, and my parents gave me some decent genes. if i wasn’t so self conscious i would love to parade some pictures of my physique here. as conceited as it sounds, it feels like a waste of effort to keep my body to myself. if ever there was a time to be out there courting beautiful young women, now is absolutely that time. call me shallow, but i just want to lose my v card and get this hormonal degeneracy out of my system before i get trapped on a boat with a gaggle of other men for the next god knows how many years. besides, college is probably my last chance to build up social and romantic experience so i don’t wind up getting my first girlfriend at the age of 30 and being completely clueless as to how to make a relationship work. i’ve learned many useful skills over the years, but the art of love is not one of them.  this quarantine has given me a lot of time to think, and i’ve decided that i *really* hate being alone. before all this, i could distract myself by spending all my free time in the library or the gym, or otherwise some place where i could pat myself on the back for being productive and improving myself. now that all of that has been taken away from me, i’m aware more than ever that i’m incredibly starved for love. hell, i’ve been strongly considering hiring an escort lately, but that would kind of undermine the whole purpose of social isolation. you’d think that the quarantine wouldn’t affect someone who doesn’t tend to socialize anyway, but i’m honestly not sure how much more of this i can take. i’m ready to go out, find a party, and pretend to be a normal teenager for once. or alternatively throw in the towel and just hit up a call girl. i don’t want to end my first 4 years of college immature and inexperienced, but i feel that i lack the power to prevent that from happening. i think that’s enough for this post though, thanks for letting me whine for a bit.",5,1,Wasting away my youth,Adult
1112,"im turned 27 not long ago and i'm not sure if its just me but each gen seems to be even more worried about ageing. i believe calling 21 a kid already stretching it. but a 22 and 23 year old especially should not be recognised as ''kids'' or even close to their late teens. the demographics of even putting 18-22/23 together does not make sense. ive seen adults who just turned 22 year olds here stating how they were still 19 ''2 years ago''. im sure you can't keep counting age like that. its like me saying i was 24 not long ago. a 22 year old is more closer to a 26 year old than to a 19 year old. even more closer to a 25 year old than a 19/20 year old. you can't age down but only up. i feel like social media is also the reasoning. tiktok has 22 year olds making content which i find odd personally. i mean its okay to make tiktoks just as family ones where i see parents making on with their kids but i mean acting like your a teenager is a bit weird. i think its okay to view them for memes. but why try to act below your age?maybe its just me. i mean of course 21+ doesn't mean you need to have your shit together, even i don't but i mean its a little weird being on a platform that is aimed towards kids and teens until 19 or 20 max. i feel like once your heading past 21 its just cringe. even seeing you tubers who are within that age group doing silly teenage things. i still do fun things like play video games here and there but i would never invest time on making social media content unless i was earning. maybe its me but its like late 1998 -1999 born onwards seem to seperate them selves from anyone else but rather group themselves with the 2000s barely even making it to the cusp of gen z.  i currently went back to study law and had a 22 or 23 year old call me ''damn you old bro but its cool'' i thought to my self , i mean we are barely any different?. allot of 22 and 23 year olds also tend to only hang out with 19-23 year olds mainly while they kinda exclude anyone whose over 25. so does the brain really not develop by 25? or is that just a western new myth. i mean why would it be 25 if the legal age starts from 21 (technically 18). i was also shocked to know addison rae is actually 20 turning 21. i mean she's young for now but tbh i don't see her maturing anytime soon at all but its a little odd...i feel old. instagram now has these things called ''reels'' its the same thing. im starting to even find it odd to match with anyone below 25 on tinder cause the way they even converse is like i'm talking to a young teen. i thought reddit was one place i didn't have to worry about any of this but lately its turning into mayhem. you are all full fledged adults please grow up and stop living in fantasy....",10,1,"22 is not a kid Imo, I believe its a full developed adult",Adult

(i'm omnisexual, however that may've not been the influence to sext guys)i think i just got so beaten by life that i became hyperfixated on prostituting my body to complete strangers because i wanted value. i wanted people to tell me my body was beautiful. it got so bad that i often pulled all-nighters going from user to user doing the same thing.i only recently have been taking steps to fight it. i deleted accounts of apps i used, as well as emails that i no longer besides using them to make accounts.after decades of a self-made hell, i'm unraveling to get the hurt out.i feel so disgusting with how i send personal photos to a bunch of random people because at the end of the day i'm not really proud of it. it's just a compulsion that consumed me. now it's this thornbush that's rooted deep in my soul.i became so obsessed with improving ny image that toxicity took me over and these awful habits took form.i would go as far as to call it freakish behavior because of how strong of a hold it has on me. i can barely breathe when it grips onto me.i lose sight of myself and i become the me i want to bury so fucking badly.i'm sick of comparing myself to my peers, sick of exploiting this part of me by sending photos to people i don't know, sick of becoming someone else just to be seen as measuring up. i'm fucking sick of not being me. people talk to me like i have nothing wrong with me, they talk like my feelings don't exist. they don't know of this broken side where i turned myself into a sexual object, a tattered soul desperate to feel like i belong. they don't know fucked i am.this year i want to be better. i hate all of it.",0,1,confessions of an emerging adult (slight tw/intense content),Adult

1416,"everybody gets a label. jock, nerd, pessimist, clown, slut- whatever it is. everyone gets one. some people get their label from their friends. some people get it from their enemies. some people get it from themselves. some people dont know they have one. but everyone does. this was what i thought when i met you.i got my label from myself and from my friends. i was the optimist. i always tried to see the glass as half full, even if that phrase is bullshit. i tried to be the light in the room. to make someone's day better. i figured this endeavour was righteous. this was what i thought when i met you.my world was simple. limited, even. this was how i liked it. everything had familiarity, nothing was out of place. if it was, it would be swiftly corrected. my world was solid, unchanging, forever trapped in sentimentality and connection. my world was simple. this was what i thought when i met you. you are not solid. you are not unchanging. you are fluid. a flash of light. a spark of energy. a feeble mind with no boundaries like my own. your world is not simple or limited. your world is vast and turbulent, changing and unsettling. your world was not familiar. this i did not know when i met you.your eyes express this energy. you try to hide it, but your complexity always leaks through. you feared this. if anyone knew the excitement, the sadness, the rush you brought, they would turn. run for their lives. your world isn't dangerous. you're living proof of that. they just fear unfamiliarity. this i did not know when i met you.you knew me, though my eyes had not seen you. in a way i suppose i knew you too, but my simple world kept me from your gaze. sheltered me for fear i might escape. it was right to be afraid. and yet, this i did not know when i met you.a label is a tag. a stamp by which all social mail is sent. everyone can see these stamps. they adorn the corners of a soul. my label was easy to see. everyone knew it, nobody more than i. but you didn't seem to have one. or if you did, i couldn't see it. it was tucked away from everyone. the same as your eyes, you hid it to keep them from running. this i loved when i met you.when i spoke to you, you didnt respond with words. maybe you did, but i can never be sure. all i heard was music. this music, like your world, was not familiar. it was joyful and yet sad. terrifying, yet alluring. insatiable and yet it asked for nothing. this i loved when i met you. i now know my label was a false one. i am not an optimist. my quest to improve people's days with my presence was not righteous. it was not motivated out of kindness, but out of selfishness. ""i was a good person"". i knew that, so everyone else had to as well. for this i am not an optimist. i am an leech. i bleed other people in the hope that i can improve my own life. you saw that. and you still stayed. this i loved when i met you. i am not a good person. the only difference between then and now is i can acknowledge it. in my mind, i know this is insanity. you were too good to last. nothing good ever lasts. and yet, in my heart, i want you to live the life you want to. as turbulent and as volatile as it might be, i can't hinder you. i'd be a leech if i did. for everything, i have to let you go.but for now, i still love you.",8,1,"Don't really know if this is appropriate here, but just felt like I need someone to read this.

1668," i've tried most of what people recommend for feeling better such as going to therapy, hanging out with friends, taking anti-depressants, sleeping enough and eating well, getting a routine, finding things that you enjoy, going out of the house etc. none of those things have really done much other than make me want to go to school and study hard.whenever i go to therapy i just leave feeling more frustrated knowing little that i talked about is going to make me feel any better because my reality will not change. i don't know why, but i'm surrounded by people and friends yet still there's a hole in my heart that never feels accepted or loved, i still feel alone. some of my friends claim i'm an alien because of how inhuman, alien-like and weird my behavior is. medications do little but kill my sex drive but since i don't have a sex life and likely never will, that doesn't really matter. sleep and routine kind of help but there's always things to make me frustrated, such as not being smart enough, not getting the results you want despite working hard (i'm the kind of person that works and worries 3 times more than the average person only to get mediocre results). i eat as healthily as possible, but there's some things flavor and texture seldom replace.i've found things i enjoy but those things don't make the pain disappear or reduce. they don't make me want to live more than the pain makes me want to die. i like programming but before the temporary happiness of coming at a solution there's days of frustration, anxiety, hopelessness, anger at one's stupidity and incompetence and banging your head at a wall to find another way. i guess in a way this pain is escape since it's a deep personal productive pain unlike moping around in bed accomplishing nothing.i've gotten a lot more social this year in order to fix my loneliness, i met a lot of fellow students from my university's discord server, i tried joining a club (left it soon after because it was too stressful). it seems that whoever i meet i have the same problem, there's no spark, no life, just a fake interaction and i'm lonely. social interactions are a double edged sword, sometimes i'll meet a nice person, the other time i'll look at couples and normal people being so happy and cheerful and that just makes me feel worse for being the way i am.i'm not going to fail all of my classes like i did last semester but i come home everyday miserable and feeling empty inside, i don't know what i can do more to try to feel better. i doubt i will survive in the future either since i can't spend more than 7 hours awake without feeling like a dead zombie.the only time when i don't think about killing myself is when i succeed at something personal or when i'm sleeping, and since i can't have the first one all the time, most of my waking existence is like having hot knives piercing me. guess suicide is my best option, to end it all rather dramatically since there's only so much someone can take - the spartans eventually fell at thermopylae. maybe i should send this spiel to my parents so they'd think of something other than ""think positive"" when they see my dead body. i don't even blame them but i do dislike them for creating me.",26,101,Just a vent from a clinically depressed student :(,Adult

2209,"  this is an update post on a post i made on here a few months ago about leaving my parents and everything i knew to better myself as a person and my mental health as a whole. this is more or less how it's going and what i've realized about myself over these last few months. i'm making this with the intent that some of you can learn from this or even uses the mistakes i've made to better yourself.to understand the story of how i got to this point you have to understand my upbringing. you see i don't exactly come from good people. it took me a long time to realize this and to be completely honest with you it still hasn't sunk in properly. my real father is a wife and child beater that didn't care about anything but himself and what he could gain by using you. my mother is a nice person upfront but is a manipulator and a bully for a lack of a better term, that being said she never laid a hand on me and tried to do her best. that still does not excuse her actions on how she was. my stepfather is the only person i can truly say was a good parent to me even if he had his own screw-ups with him serving in the military. he wasn't kind or forgiving. he belittled be and did make me feel as though i was an awful person, but i feel i wouldn't be the person i am today if he didn't push me to not be that kid that went and hid even if he didn't do it in a good way, but to be fair i wasn't exactly the nicest kid.with all these negative influences surrounding me, i never knew how to act. i would through fits, get in fights for no reason with them, and shut people out just for talking to me. on top of all that i would deliberately lock myself in my room just so i didn't have to talk to anyone because i thought if i did that no one would have to deal with me. i would have trouble sleeping because if i wasn't up when my parents were up i would get the power in my room shut off so i learned the sound of their footsteps and would make up instinctively right before they opened my door.there's more detail in between but i don't want this to be ten pages long. from all that about 6 months ago i moved into my grandparents to try to better myself. i lived with them when i was younger because i felt safer there and after my parent's divorce we ended up living there anyway. they are very kind and supportive and see where i fall behind and just want to see me be the best person i can be. we made all our friends there too. it’s been a positive experience overall and my mental health has gone up a lot and i'll be going back to school again. while living here i've noticed things about myself that i didn't know were there till i started acting more human for lack of a better term.i had my first dream since i was thirteen, four months ago, it was a strange experience and i cried when i woke up not because the dream was sad but because it was the first time since i was thirteen that i felt safe enough to fall into a deep enough sleep to dream in the first place. i didn't realize how important it was till i got it back and how much just feeling safe can have on a person. it's surreal for me to think that a year ago i was thinking of killing myself and just a year later i can feel safe again.the biggest challenge i'm facing at the moment is social interaction or just making friends in general. i know how to put on a fake smile and act normal for the most part. but what i'm working on is not being fake and just trying to be myself. my only problem is i really don't know where i begin and the fake me ends. it's frustrating to try to be yourself when even you don't know who you are, to begin with. right now i'm just trying to talk to random people and just be as real as i can be. finding myself is something i never thought i would be doing let alone struggling within this way so it’s a hard realization but one i've come to expect.on the lighter side of things, i've got myself a car and a job that fits with the career path i've chosen. it was hard when i didn't have a job for almost a year but i got right back into things. i recently started hanging out with old friends i had here. although we have nothing really in common its a good jumping-off point. on top of all that like in said earlier i’ll be starting back up in school again so i can finally chase the degree i've always wanted. my hope is that i continue in this upward spiral so i can continue bettering myself and those around me.to sum it all up i made this post to get my raw feelings and emotions out in the open. i've never really opened up to people, or at least as long as i can remember so i'm doing this to get myself more open to talking and hopefully soon have the courage enough to see a therapist that can give me professional help because opening up to a screen to random people on the internet isn't the best way to do it. if at all possible even if you hated this, liked it, or even found that you could relate to some of my problems please just remember this. even if hell seems to be knocking at your door and you have nothing else just remember there’s always a brighter tomorrow.&amp;#x200b;as i'm finishing this its 1 am. i would like to

that was the most surface-level pop feminism. i don’t think any sane person would ever protest a person’s funeral. there was no depth to that discussion and it felt really out of touch. i suppose it may have been a satirical commentary on some more radical feminism, but that makes up for a very small minority of feminists, whereas in this show, the minority was the non-radical individuals who were critical of the funeral protest (read: jessica, bolan, ani, tyler). i suppose it could be a commentary on hivemind/groupthink stemming from a few radical individuals (in this case, one particularly radical individual), but for some reason, i doubt it.**what does 13 reasons get right?**i think they did get a few things right. i can’t speak from experience, but one of my best friends had to get an abortion once. she said that there were pro-life protestors at the clinic and that her boyfriend had to get aggressive with them in order to prevent them from harassing her. i think their depiction of the challenge of getting an abortion was pretty accurate.we’re only on the fifth episode, but so far, they’ve depicted drugs and alcohol very well. alcohol lowers your inhibitions, make you stumble and slur, etc obviously. i’ve only done it a handful of times, but coke is not some insane drug like some other shows or movies may depict it to be. it’s just a giant dopamine hit, and when it’s finished, it feels like a christmas morning i think they did a decent job depicting immigration issues. i don’t know if ice shows up at the doorstep, but i know that immigration issues cost tens of thousands in legal fees. people often skip town if they are in jeopardy of deportation, particularly once they receive immigration notices. perhaps ice’s methods have become more aggressive in the past 10 years (i have no experience w it since then), but i’m not educated enough on the subject to comment on that.tl;dr: they depicted a lot of things inaccurately and a few issues accurately, but all in all, it’s a pretty awful show (it feels like i’m consuming the junk food of tv, akin to reality tv or something)... i’m v excited to move on and check out the next season of mindhunter though, i really enjoyed the first season.**discussion:** i’d love to hear y’alls thoughts on the show, especially if you feel like anything (vices, mental issues, social life) was depicted accurately or inaccurately. i just can’t voice my concerns about the depiction of stuff like steroids and escorts to the people around me anymore without the risk of being ostracized to a degree, so it’s nice to do it on this subreddit where things are anonymous. my old social group was much more open to it, but it’s gonna take a bit to find a group that i can fully express myself in.",1,2,the newest season of “13 Reasons Why”,Adult

4663,"i was a wonderfully energetic and kind kid. i was well adjusted and acclimated to the educational environment that all kids go through. i loved school, so much so that i did college level courses all throughout high school. i recall doing incredible on my examinations and even though i was socially regressed and had a bad at home life, i still managed to excel academically. school was my best friend, because nothing beats an education.i graduated at 18 with a full ride scholarship and was successful in pursuing a post secondary education. i was thrilled to continue my education while having the privilege to work at a lawful occupation with a schedule that allowed for me to study and pursue classes. i will never forget how much i adored the structural integrity provided to me at such a young age, as it gave me many positive outlets. i loved having the right to bear arms, purchase goods and services, pay my bills such as car insurance and car payments, and drive unobstructed on public roads that were maintained in part with taxes i paid.however, i made some of the most horrific and detrimental decisions that i’ve ever made in my young life. after my college courses were over i began making the wrong friends. my cousin whom i lived with was dating a convicted felon who was on felony probation, and i was surrounding myself with people such as him and drug users. overtime, i chose to adapt to the environment consisting of negative activities as opposed to involving myself more with positive role models. i was an adult, and i should’ve known better than to be around the wrong people. i wound up committing a multitude of violent theft related felony offenses soon after i turned 19 years old. i thought that i was special and therefor exempt from the laws and social norms that society expects from its citizens. i believed that i wasn’t responsible for abusing illicit controlled substances, and i believed that i didn’t need to address some very prominent mental health related problems by continuing to attend therapy sessions that were provided free of charge by my community college.at 20 years old, i am a convicted felon. a thief. i no longer have my full ride scholarship, and my academic background has been disregarded and overshadowed by the newly adopted persona of a criminal. i am on a drug offender supervised release program for a period of over 5 years, of which i may not leave the county. my prospective university no longer will allow me to attend classes and they will not confer any type of degree to me. i am no longer a bright, kind, intelligent young man with prospects of obtaining a lucrative career path. i will not have easy access to gainful employment, as i’ve found that even small companies do not want to risk having a convicted thief on their payroll.at 20 years old, i may never vote again. i may not own or possess a firearm, ammunition or body armor. i may not own or possess any weapon during my supervised release. i may not make new meaningful connections through a post secondary institution, as i cannot go further than the aa degree i’ve earned. i will never get to experience the joys of freedom, all because i abused my freedom to deprive others to their right to own property.the judge informed me that one of the victims called me a “menace to society.” i am in no position to disagree. a menace is an unwanted cancer on the body of society, one that must be removed and terminated. at just 20 years old, i will be doing the right thing for society. i will be ending my life. i will provide closure for the victims of my thefts by ending my life, as they’ll never have to worry about me potentially reoffending ever again. i will save money for the tax payers and family whom i burdened with legal fees, probation fees, and other fees since i can’t locate gainful employment any longer.i want this to be a warning to any of you who thinks it pays to be a thief. if you believe that just because you have an education and you’re a white male that you can just violate the law as blatantly as i have, think again. if you think a crime spree or drug use is “fun,” think long and hard about the long lasting ramifications that your actions can and will have on the lives of others. i want to apologize to my victims, family and friends for my sins. i want to apologize to the police and the state for the extreme cost of investigation, and i’d like to apologize to the school system for investing so much time and effort into a prospect who chose to turn into dangerous liability. my suicide symbolizes regret. it symbolizes shame, and it symbolizes punishment. i believe the self imposition of a sentence of death is fair and not cruel or unusual given the circumstance of my crimes. despite nobody being injured, assaulted or otherwise directly involved during the commission of my criminal activities, a homeowner could’ve been fatally injured or otherwise harmed had they come outside during my deviant actions. because i knowingly and willingly committed these offenses while under the influence of illegal narcotics, i find it improbable and unlikely that my life holds any continued value.i am eternally ashamed and apologetic for becoming a reckless, unstable monster by abusing my freedom to become a danger to myself and others within the community. it is absolutely unacceptable to live this life knowing that what i’ve done could’ve resulted in great bodily injury or death. it is a constitutional right in the united states to be able to own and possess property, and i deprived and violated multiple victims of that right. therefor, i find it reasonable and with probable cause to discontinue the remainder of my existence due to me exhibiting an absolute lack of care and regard for human life and property.i’ll be sentencing myself to death shortly.",4,1,I am a convicted felon at 20 years old.

5887,"you know when you're a child, and you're constantly consuming tv shows, books, and movies about kids your age or slightly older going on adventures to save the world, falling in love, finding themselves, etc etc? and there was just something so inspirational and *magical* about it? i obviously never expected that i'd turn out to be a demigod and go to camp halfblood, or become a wizard, or go pokemon hunting, or accompany the avatar on wacky adventures or whatever. but it was drilled into my head that childhood, adolescence and young adulthood are the most magical times of your life, with beauty and meaning and adventure. it's strange to revisit the stories of characters i always thought of as so much older and more accomplished than me, and remember that they're like six or seven years younger than me in the book. it makes me feel like a lame grandma. it's not like i've lived under a rock for the past ten years, but i've struggled with depression, abuse at the hands of professionals, social isolation, and a serious feeling of disappointment in my youth. i never had that ""magic close friend group"" although i'd have liked to have one. i have close friends, but nothing ever like that. i've dated, but no amazing love stories. (i certainly didn't end up with anyone i had a crush on in high school.) compared to my ya-fiction primed expectations, my life has felt very *meh.*  it's kind of hard not to revisit my pokemon games and percy jackson books, and all the stories i loved as a child, when i somehow envisioned that my coming of age stories would be similarly exciting and meaningful, and think ""that was it?"" it's like there's still some eleven-year old me sitting there inside of 21-year old me, expecting my life thus far to have been some ya-novel adventure. i don't know if this is the cult of youth messing with me or if i really am a disappointment.can anyone else relate to feeling underwhelmed by their ""coming of age"" not being as exciting as they thought it would be?",1,1,"This is how I'd describe my quarter-life crisis, YA novel-style",Adult
5894,"hey everyone!  i am a student at the university of washington in seattle participating in design for america, a national organization that's goal is to design for social good! this year, my team is working on addressing the question of ""how might we continue to engage younger voters in all elections beyond 2020?"" through this survey, we're hoping to learn more about patterns and behaviors among young voters.we are looking for people who are between 18 and 29 years old and were eligible to vote in this last presidential election (by eligible, we mean that you are registered or could register to vote if you wanted to). we would also appreciate it if you could share it with friends as we also want to hear from people outside of washington as views on young voting differs greatly around the country![https://forms.gle/sjszntkftmbbjeyn7](https://forms.gle/sjszntkftmbbjeyn7)",0,1,Voting Patterns Among Young Adults,Adult
5906,"hi everyone, as quarantine and online learning continue forward, i am more and more drowning in frustration. whenever i feel tired, i pick up my phone, open reddit/twitter/instagram and scroll for between 5 to 15 minutes. but doing this makes me more sad and tired. i need a distraction that i can use to waste little times between my daily activities. i played puzzles for some time but they got boring quick. so, does anyone know any good alternatives to waste short times? i don't want to look at social media anymore. wish you all happy, healthy days.",13,1,Free time activity,Adult
5940,and for a lot of us continuing into our fall semester with online classes or limited social interaction but  i think for at least a good portion of the upperclassman you’re getting word through the grapevine that one of your freshman year roommate was recently diagnosed with scurvy simply because he’s a lazy dude who hasn’t eaten anything but pizza for the last three years and didn’t see anything wrong with it until he moved back in with his parents.   so that’s what happened to noah after freshman year when everyone found out he didn’t like orang,0,1,Everyone has their own weird college stories and experiences and with everything going on this year we all have one universal experience that shit and sanity and having to leave campus because of the plague.

6005,"this doesn't exactly seem like the most active subreddit, but i've kind of wondered for a while if i'm socially inept, but not in the most regular way.i have no problem talking to strangers, i'm not awful at making friends in person a lot. but sometimes i really think i am awful at it. i'm not introverted but i feel like i have no choice but to be alone most of the time. i've lived with friends and that's been fine, i hang out with them too (when not in lockdown) but i text no one. by text i mean across any social media, no snapchat, twitter, instagram messages, nearly ever. if i post a story or something i've an occasional reply but nothing that goes into conversation.i don't know if it's understandable or what, i just feel like every one or most have people or at least someone to talk to.i noticed it before but during lockdown it's really affected me. i have genuinely no idea who to talk to and it's kind of destroying me.",0,1,Social Issues?,Adult
