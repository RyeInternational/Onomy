       "\"i seriously didn't know where to put this question, i hope this is an okay place. \\n\\na little background: so i'm 22 with a valid driver's license from my home state that still has my parents address on it. i actually moved to the state/town i live in several years ago, but have been a bit of a wanderer and rarely had a permanent address so i just didn't want to deal with the hassle of updating my driver's license.\\n\\n now it's time to do it and i think i may have trouble proving that i'm a resident of this state, even though i've been here for a few years. currently am living with a friend in the most permanent situation i've been in and probably will be for a while longer. he is the one on the lease and has bills in his name, and we only have like a verbal agreement to pay rent/bills, no contract. i don't have any bills of my own or official mail. my w-2 this year had an old address on it that i'm not associated at all with anymore. i have a pay stub, and could get my friend to write up something that says i pay rent at his place, but before i go to the dmv and waste my time i guess i wanna know if that's enough for them to consider me a resident? has anyone had any experience with this? the website gives a list of acceptable documents to prove residency but i don't have any of them/they don't apply to me. thanks!\""
